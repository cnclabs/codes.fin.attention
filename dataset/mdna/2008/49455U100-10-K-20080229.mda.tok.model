represents income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle per unit 
basic limited partners income per unit from continuing operations before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was computed by dividing the interest of our unitholders in income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle by the weighted average number of units outstanding during the period 
diluted limited partners net income per unit reflects the maximum potential dilution that could occur if units whose issuance depends on the market price of the units at a future date were considered outstanding  or if  by application of the treasury stock method  options to issue units were exercised  both of which would result in the issuance of additional units that would then share in our net income 
represents the amount of cash distributions declared with respect to that year 
for the purpose of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  earnings are defined as income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  and before minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries  equity earnings including amortization of excess cost of equity investments and unamortized capitalized interest  plus fixed charges and distributed income of equity investees 
fixed charges are defined as the sum of interest on all indebtedness excluding capitalized interest  amortization of debt issuance costs and that portion of rental expense which we believe to be representative of an interest factor

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations provides a narrative of our financial results 
it contains a discussion and analysis of the results of operations for each segment of our business  followed by a discussion and analysis of our financial condition 
the following discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report and were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
additional sections in this report which should be helpful to the reading of our discussion and analysis include the following i a description of our business strategy found in items and business and properties c narrative description of business business strategy  ii a description of developments during  found in items and business and properties a general development of business recent developments  and iii a description of risk factors affecting us and our business  found in item a risk factors 
in addition  as discussed in note of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements  our financial statements reflect the april  transfer of trans mountain as if such transfer had taken place on january   the effective date of common control pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles 
the financial information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes the financial results of trans mountain for all periods subsequent to january   and the reclassifications necessary to reflect the results of our north system as discontinued operations 
however  due to the fact that the sale of our north system does not change the structure of our internal organization in a manner that causes a change to our reportable business segments pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  we have included the north system s financial results within our products pipelines business segment disclosures for all periods presented in this report 
we begin with a discussion of our critical accounting polices and estimates  those areas that are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates  and the application of generally accepted accounting principles involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities  our revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we routinely evaluate these estimates  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  the fair values used to allocate purchase price and to determine possible asset impairment charges  reserves for environmental claims  legal fees  transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables  exposures under contractual indemnifications  and unbilled revenues 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others  which policies are discussed as follows 
environmental matters with respect to our environmental exposure  we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts 
we expense or capitalize  as appropriate  environmental expenditures that relate to current operations  and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs 
we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value  and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable 
our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action  but generally  we recognize and or adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations 
these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates 
these environmental liability adjustments are recorded pursuant to our management s requirement to recognize contingent environmental liabilities whenever the associated environmental issue is likely to occur and the amount of our liability can be reasonably estimated 
in making these liability estimations  we consider the effect of environmental compliance  pending legal actions against us  and potential third party liability claims 
for more information on our environmental disclosures  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
legal matters we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions 
we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders  judgments or settlements 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates  our earnings will be affected 
in general  we expense legal costs as incurred 
when we identify specific litigation that is expected to continue for a significant period of time and require substantial expenditures  we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to litigate the matter to a conclusion or reach an acceptable settlement 
if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount  we record a liability equal to the low end of the range 
any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available 
as of december   our most significant ongoing litigation proceedings involve our sfpp  l 
p  subsidiary  which is the limited partnership that owns our pacific operations pipelines  excluding calnev pipe line llc 
tariffs charged by our pacific operations pipeline systems are subject to certain proceedings at the ferc involving shippers complaints regarding the interstate rates  as well as practices and the jurisdictional nature of certain facilities and services 
generally  the interstate rates on our pacific operations pipeline systems are grandfathered under the energy policy act of unless substantially changed circumstances are found to exist 
to the extent substantially changed circumstances are found to exist  our pacific operations may be subject to substantial exposure under these ferc complaints and could  therefore  owe reparations and or refunds to complainants as mandated by the ferc or the united states judicial system 
for more information on our pacific operations regulatory proceedings  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
intangible assets intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance 
we account for our intangible assets according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these accounting pronouncements introduced the concept of indefinite life intangible assets and provided that all identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives  including goodwill  will not be subject to regular periodic amortization 
such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite 
instead  the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
we have selected an impairment measurement test date of january of each year  and we have determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of january  as of december   our goodwill was  million 
included in this goodwill balance is million related to our trans mountain business segment  which we acquired from knight on april  following the provisions of generally accepted accounting principles  this transaction caused knight to consider the fair value of the trans mountain pipeline system  and to determine whether goodwill related to these assets was impaired 
knight recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the first quarter of this impairment is also reflected on our books due to the accounting principles for transfers of assets between entities under common control  which require us to account for trans mountain as if the transfer had taken place on january  our remaining intangible assets  excluding goodwill  include customer relationships  contracts and agreements  technology based assets and lease value 
these intangible assets have definite lives  are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  and are reported separately as other intangibles  net in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  these intangibles totaled million and million  respectively 
estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 
the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves  both developed and undeveloped 
the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect  among other things  whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed  the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities 
the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of proved reserves may change  either positively or negatively  as additional information becomes available and as contractual  economic and political conditions change 
hedging activities we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices and to balance our exposure to fixed and floating interest rates  and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives 
however  the accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are complex  and even when we engage in hedging transactions that are effective economically  these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes 
according to the provisions of current accounting standards  to be considered effective  changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged 
a perfectly effective hedge is one in which changes in the value of the derivative contract exactly offset changes in the value of the hedged item or expected cash flow of the future transactions in reporting periods covered by the derivative contract 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately  accordingly  our financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges 
in addition  it is not always possible for us to engage in a hedging transaction that completely mitigates our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices 
for example  when we purchase a commodity at one location and sell it at another  we may be unable to hedge completely our exposure to a differential in the price of the product between these two locations 
even when we cannot enter into a completely effective hedge  we often enter into hedges that are not completely effective in those instances where we believe to do so would be better than not hedging at all  but due to the fact that the part of the hedging transaction that is not effective in offsetting undesired changes in commodity prices the ineffective portion is required to be recognized currently in earnings  our financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge 
results of operations our business model is built to support two principal components helping customers by providing energy  bulk commodity and liquids products transportation  storage and distribution  and creating long term value for our unitholders 
to achieve these objectives  we focus on providing fee based services to customers from a business portfolio consisting of energy related pipelines  bulk and liquids terminal facilities  and carbon dioxide and petroleum reserves 
our reportable business segments are based on the way our management organizes our enterprise  and each of our five segments represents a component of our enterprise that engages in a separate business activity and for which discrete financial information is available

bankruptcy proceeding 
for the year  our net income was million on revenues of  million 
this compares with net income of  million on revenues of  million in  and net income of million on revenues of  million in the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above account for million of the year to year decrease of million 
the remaining increase in net income is associated with better performance from our operating segments 
the primary reason for the decrease in our net income  when compared to last year  was related to an impairment expense of million associated with a non cash reduction in the carrying value of trans mountain s goodwill 
included within the certain items footnoted in the table above  and discussed above in intangibles  the goodwill impairment charge was recognized by knight in march following our purchase of trans mountain from knight on april   the financial results of trans mountain since january   including the impact of the goodwill impairment  are reflected in our results 
also  our overall carrying value for the net assets of trans mountain reflects knight s carrying value  which is considerably higher than the cash price we paid 
for more information on this acquisition and the goodwill impairment  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses because our partnership agreement requires us to distribute of our available cash to our partners on a quarterly basis available cash consists primarily of all our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and changes in reserves  we consider each period s earnings before all non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  including amortization of excess cost of equity investments  to be an important measure of our success in maximizing returns to our partners 
we also use segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses defined in the table above and sometimes referred to in this report as ebda internally as a measure of profit and loss used for evaluating segment performance and for deciding how to allocate resources to our five reportable business segments 
combined  the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above decreased total segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization by million in  relative to combining to decrease total segment ebda by million in and to increase segment ebda by million in 
the remaining million increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in versus was driven by strong financial results from increased margins on natural gas transport  storage and processing activities  incremental earnings from dry bulk product and petroleum liquids terminal operations  higher crude oil and natural gas liquids revenues  incremental earnings from completed expansion projects  and our acquisition of the trans mountain pipeline system and the remaining interest in the cochin pipeline system that we did not already own 
in  the certain items described above combined to increase total segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization by million  compared to the previous year combining to increase total segment ebda by million in and to decrease segment ebda by million in 
the remaining million increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in versus was primarily attributable to internal growth and expansion across our business portfolio and to incremental contributions from assets and operations acquired since the end of products pipelines year ended december  in millions  except operating statistics revenues operating expenses a other income b earnings from equity investments c interest income and other  net income expense d income tax benefit expense e earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and amortization of excess cost of equity investments gasoline mmbbl diesel fuel mmbbl jet fuel mmbbl total refined product volumes mmbbl natural gas liquids mmbbl total delivery volumes mmbbl f a  and amounts include increases in expense of million  million and million  respectively  associated with environmental liability adjustments

f includes pacific  plantation  calnev  central florida  cochin  and cypress pipeline volumes 
our products pipelines segment s primary businesses include transporting refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids through pipelines and operating liquid petroleum products terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix processing facilities 
combined  the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above decreased earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization by million in compared to  and increased earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization by million in compared to following is information related to the remaining increases and decreases in the segment s i earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses ebda  and ii operating revenues in both and  when compared to the respective prior year year ended december  versus year ended december  ebda revenues increase decrease increase decrease in millions  except percentages cochin pipeline system west coast terminals plantation pipeline transmix operations pacific operations calnev pipeline southeast terminals north system all other including eliminations total products pipelines year ended december  versus year ended december  ebda revenues increase decrease increase decrease in millions  except percentages cochin pipeline system southeast terminals plantation pipeline pacific operations west coast terminals transmix operations all other including eliminations total products pipelines all of the assets in our products pipelines business segment produced higher earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in than in the previous year 
the overall increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to was driven largely by incremental earnings from our cochin pipeline system 
the higher earnings and revenues from cochin were largely attributable to our january  acquisition of the remaining approximate ownership interest that we did not already own 
upon closing of the transaction  we became the operator of the pipeline 
for more information on this acquisition  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the year to year earnings increase from our west coast terminal operations in was due to higher operating revenues  lower operating expenses and incremental gains from asset sales 
the increases in terminal revenues were driven by higher throughput volumes from our combined carson los angeles harbor terminal system  partly due to completed storage expansion projects since the end of  and from our linnton and willbridge terminals located in portland  oregon 
the decrease in operating expenses in versus was largely related to higher environmental expenses recognized in  due to adjustments to accrued environmental liabilities these incremental environmental expenses were not associated with the expenses described in footnote a to the table above 
the increase in earnings in from our approximate equity investment in plantation pipe line company was due to higher overall net income earned by plantation  largely resulting from both higher pipeline revenues and lower period to period operating expenses 
the increase in revenues was largely due to a higher oil loss allowance percentage in  relative to last year  and the drop in operating expenses including fuel  power and pipeline maintenance expenses  was due to decreases in both refined products delivery volumes and pipeline integrity expenses in versus pipeline integrity expenses are discussed more fully below 
the year to year increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from our petroleum pipeline transmix operations was directly related to higher revenues  reflecting incremental revenues from our greensboro  north carolina facility and higher processing revenues from our colton  california facility 
in may  we completed construction and placed into service the greensboro facility  and during  the plant processed greater volumes than in in  our greensboro facility contributed incremental earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million and incremental revenues of million in compared to the increases in earnings and revenues from our colton facility  which processes transmix generated from volumes transported to the southern california and arizona markets by our pacific operations pipelines  were primarily due to year to year increases in average processing contract rates 
we also benefited from higher earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from our pacific operations  our calnev pipeline and our north system in  when compared to last year 
the increase in our pacific operations earnings was largely revenue related  attributable to increases in both transportation volumes and average tariff rates 
combined mainline delivery and terminal revenues increased in  compared to  due largely to higher delivery volumes to arizona  the completed expansion of our east line pipeline during the summer of  and higher deliveries to various west coast military bases 
the increase from calnev was also driven by higher year over year revenues  due to increased military and commercial tariff rates in  and higher terminal revenues associated with ethanol blending at our las vegas terminal that more than offset a drop in refined products delivery volumes 
the increase from our north system was mainly due to lower combined operating expense  due to its sale in the fourth quarter of the decline in expense was greater than the associated decline in revenue 
effective october   we sold our north system common carrier natural gas liquids pipeline and our ownership interest in the heartland pipeline company to oneok partners  lp for approximately million  and we used the proceeds we received to pay down short term debt borrowings 
we accounted for our north system business as a discontinued operation pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles which require that the income statement be formatted to separate the divested business from our continuing operations  however  consistent with the management approach of identifying and reporting financial information on operating segments  we have included the north system s financial results within our products pipelines business segment disclosures for all periods presented in this discussion and analysis 
this decision was based on the way our management organizes segments internally to make operating decisions and assess performance 
we do not expect the impact of the discontinued operations to materially affect our overall business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
for information on our reconciliation of segment information with our consolidated general purpose financial statements  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
combining all of the segment s operations  while revenues from refined petroleum products deliveries increased in  compared to last year  total refined products delivery volumes decreased 
compared to last year  gasoline delivery volumes decreased primarily due to plantation  while diesel and jet fuel volumes were up and  respectively 
excluding plantation  which continued to be impacted by a competing pipeline that began service in mid  total refined products delivery volumes increased by in  when compared to volumes on our pacific operations and our central florida pipelines were up and  respectively  in  and while natural gas liquids delivery volumes were down in versus  revenues were up substantially due to our increased ownership in the cochin pipeline system 
the million decrease in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in  when compared to  was largely due to a combined decrease in earnings of million in due to incremental pipeline maintenance expenses recognized in the last half of the year 
beginning in the third quarter of  the refined petroleum products pipelines and associated terminal operations included within our products pipelines segment including plantation pipe line company  our owned equity investee began recognizing certain costs incurred as part of their pipeline integrity management program as maintenance expense in the period incurred  and in addition  recorded an expense for costs previously capitalized during the first six months of combined  this change reduced the segment s earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses by million in increasing maintenance expenses by million  decreasing earnings from equity investments by million  and decreasing income tax expenses by million 
pipeline integrity costs encompass those costs incurred as part of an overall pipeline integrity management program  which is a process for assessing and mitigating pipeline risks in order to reduce both the likelihood and consequences of incidents 
our pipeline integrity program is designed to provide our management the information needed to effectively allocate resources for appropriate prevention  detection and mitigation activities 
the remaining million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared with  primarily consisted of the following items a million increase from our southeast refined products terminal operations  driven by higher liquids throughput volumes at higher rates  relative to  and higher margins from ethanol blending and sales activities  a million increase from our combined pacific and calnev pipeline operations  primarily due to a million increase in operating revenues  which more than offset an million increase in combined operating expenses 
the increase in operating revenues consisted of a million increase from refined products deliveries and a million increase from terminal and other fee revenue 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher fuel and power expenses  and a million increase from our central florida pipeline  mainly due to higher product delivery revenues in driven by higher average tariff and terminal rates 
combining all of the segment s operations  while total delivery volumes of refined petroleum products decreased in compared to  total delivery volumes from our pacific operations were up compared to  due in part to the east line expansion which was in service for the last seven months of the expansion project substantially increased pipeline capacity from el paso  texas to tucson and phoenix  arizona 
in addition  our calnev pipeline delivery volumes were up in versus  due primarily to strong demand from the southern california and las vegas  nevada markets 
the overall decrease in year to year segment deliveries of refined petroleum products was largely related to a drop in volumes from the plantation pipeline in  as described above

collectively  our texas intrastate group serves the texas gulf coast region by transporting  buying  selling  processing  treating and storing natural gas from multiple onshore and offshore supply sources 
the higher earnings in both and  when compared to the respective prior years  were primarily due to higher sales margins on renewal and incremental contracts  increased transportation revenue from higher volumes and rates  greater value from natural gas storage activities  and higher natural gas processing margins 
our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group also benefited  in  from higher sales of cushion gas  due to the termination of a storage facility lease  and from incremental natural gas storage revenues  due to a long term contract with one of its largest customers that became effective april  although natural gas sales volumes were down almost in compared to  natural gas transport volumes on our texas intrastate systems increased in and in  resulting in higher year over year transportation revenues 
because the group also buys and sells natural gas  the variances from period to period in both segment revenues and segment operating expenses which include natural gas costs of sales are due to changes in our intrastate group s average prices and volumes for natural gas purchased and sold 
the increase in earnings from our casper and douglas natural gas processing operations in  when compared to  was driven by an overall increase in operating revenues 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher natural gas liquids sales revenues  due to increases in both prices and volume 
the increase in earnings was primarily related to incremental earnings associated with favorable hedge settlements from our natural gas gathering and processing operations 
we benefited from comparative differences in hedge settlements associated with the rolling off of older low price crude oil and propane positions at december  the decrease in earnings in from our rocky mountain interstate natural gas pipeline group  which is comprised of kinder morgan interstate gas transmission llc  trailblazer pipeline company llc  transcolorado gas transmission company llc  and our current equity investment in rockies express pipeline llc  resulted primarily from a million decrease in equity earnings from our investment in rockies express 
the decrease in earnings from rockies express  which began interim service in february  reflected lower net income due primarily to incremental depreciation and interest expense allocable to a segment of the project that was placed in service in february and  until the completion of the rockies express west project  had limited natural gas reservation revenues and volumes 
rockies express west is a mile  inch diameter natural gas pipeline that extends eastward from the cheyenne hub in weld county  colorado to audrain county  missouri 
it has the capacity to transport up to billion cubic feet of natural gas per day and it began interim service for up to billion cubic feet per day on approximately miles of line on january  rockies express west is expected to become fully operational in mid march the million increase in earnings in  relative to  from our rocky mountain interstate natural gas pipeline group was driven by a million increase in earnings from our kinder morgan interstate gas transmission system and a million increase from transcolorado pipeline 
the increase from kmigt was due largely to higher revenues earned in from both operational sales of natural gas and natural gas park and loan services 
kmigt s operational gas sales are primarily made possible by its collection of fuel in kind pursuant to its transportation tariffs and recovery of storage cushion gas volumes 
the increase from transcolorado was largely due to higher natural gas transmission revenues earned in compared to  chiefly related to higher natural gas delivery volumes resulting from both system improvements and the successful negotiation of incremental firm transportation contracts 
the pipeline system improvements were associated with an expansion  completed since the end of the first quarter of  on the northern portion of the pipeline 
both the drop  in  and the increase  in  in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from our equity investment in the red cedar gathering company were mainly due to higher prices on incremental sales of excess fuel gas and to higher natural gas gathering revenues in  relative to both and co year ended december  in millions  except operating statistics revenues a operating expenses b other income earnings from equity investments other  net income expense income tax benefit expense earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and amortization of excess cost of equity investments carbon dioxide delivery volumes bcf c sacroc oil production gross mbbl d d sacroc oil production net mbbl d e yates oil production gross mbbl d d yates oil production net mbbl d e natural gas liquids sales volumes net mbbl d e realized weighted average oil price per bbl f g realized weighted average natural gas liquids price per bbl g h a amount includes a million loss from a decrease in revenues on derivative contracts used to hedge forecasted crude oil sales

the increase was largely due to higher oil production at the yates oil field unit  higher realized average oil prices in relative to  and higher earnings from natural gas liquids sales due largely to increased recoveries at the snyder  texas gas plant and to an increase in our realized weighted average price per barrel 
the year to year decrease in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from the segment s sales and transportation activities was primarily due to a decrease in carbon dioxide sales revenues  resulting mainly from lower average prices for carbon dioxide in  and partly from a drop in average carbon dioxide delivery volumes 
the segment s average price received for all carbon dioxide sales decreased in  when compared to the decrease was mainly attributable to the expiration of a significantly high priced sales contract in december the segment s million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared with was driven by higher earnings from the segment s carbon dioxide sales and transportation activities  largely due to higher revenues from both carbon dioxide sales and deliveries  and from crude oil pipeline transportation 
the overall increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization was partly offset by lower earnings from oil and gas producing activities and by lower equity earnings from the segment s ownership interest in cortez pipeline company 
the decrease in earnings from oil and gas producing activities in compared with was primarily due to higher combined operating expenses and to the previously disclosed drop in crude oil production at the sacroc oil field unit  discussed below 
the higher operating expenses included higher field operating and maintenance expenses including well workover expenses  higher property and severance taxes  and higher fuel and power expenses 
the increases in expenses more than offset higher overall crude oil and natural gas plant product sales revenues  which increased primarily from higher realized sales prices and partly from higher crude oil production at the yates field unit 
the overall increases in segment revenues in and  when compared to respective prior years  were mainly due to higher revenues from the segment s oil and gas producing activities crude oil sales and natural gas liquids sales 
combined  crude oil and plant product sales revenues increased million in compared to  and million in compared to the year over year increases in revenues from the sales of natural gas liquids were driven by favorable sales price variances our realized weighted average price per barrel increased in and in  when compared to the respective prior year 
the year over year increases in revenues from the sales of crude oil reflected annual increases in our realized weighted average price per barrel of in both and  and although total crude oil sales volumes were relatively flat in compared to  sales volumes decreased in compared to average gross oil production for was thousand barrels per day at the yates unit  up from  and thousand barrels per day at sacroc  a decline of versus the year to year decline in crude oil production at the sacroc field unit is attributable to lower observed recoveries from recent project areas and due to an intentional slow down in development pace given this reduction in recoveries 
for more information on our ownership interests in the net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and our measures of discounted future net cash flows from oil and gas reserves  please see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition  because our co segment is exposed to commodity price risk related to the price volatility of crude oil and natural gas liquids  we mitigate this risk through a long term hedging strategy that is intended to generate more stable realized prices by using derivative contracts as hedges to the exposure of fluctuating expected future cash flows produced by changes in commodity sales prices 
all of our hedge gains and losses for crude oil and natural gas liquids are included in our realized average price for oil 
had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk  our crude oil sales prices would have averaged per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in for more information on our hedging activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

in  we invested approximately million to acquire terminal assets and equity investments  and our significant terminal acquisitions since the fourth quarter of included the following all of the membership interests of transload services  llc  which provides material handling and steel processing services at steel related terminal facilities located in the chicago metropolitan area and various cities in the united states  acquired november  all of the membership interests of devco usa llc  which includes a proprietary technology that transforms molten sulfur into solid pellets that are environmentally friendly and easier to transport  acquired december   the vancouver wharves bulk marine terminal  which includes five deep sea vessel berths and terminal assets located on the north shore of the port of vancouver s main harbor 
the assets include significant rail infrastructure  dry bulk and liquid storage  and material handling systems  and were acquired may   and the terminal assets and operations acquired from marine terminals  inc  which are primarily involved in the handling and storage of steel and alloys and consist of two separate facilities located in blytheville  arkansas  and individual terminal facilities located in decatur  alabama  hertford  north carolina  and berkley  south carolina 
the assets were acquired effective september  combined  these operations accounted for incremental amounts of earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  revenues of million  operating expenses of million and equity earnings of million  respectively  in all of the incremental amounts represent the earnings  revenues and expenses from the acquired terminals operations during the additional months of ownership in  and do not include increases or decreases during the same months we owned the assets in in  we also benefited significantly from the incremental contributions attributable to the bulk and liquids terminal businesses we acquired during and in addition to the two acquisitions acquired in the fourth quarter of and referred to above  these acquisitions included the following significant businesses our texas petcoke terminals  located in and around the ports of houston and beaumont  texas  acquired effective april   three terminals acquired separately in july our kinder morgan staten island terminal  a dry bulk terminal located in hawesville  kentucky and a liquids dry bulk facility located in blytheville  arkansas  and all of the ownership interests in general stevedores  lp  which operates a break bulk terminal facility located along the houston ship channel  acquired effective july  combined  these terminal acquisitions accounted for incremental amounts of earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  revenues of million and operating expenses of million  respectively  in a majority of these increases in earnings  revenues and expenses were attributable to the inclusion of our texas petroleum coke terminals  which we acquired from trans global solutions  inc on april  for an aggregate consideration of approximately million 
the primary assets acquired included facilities and railway equipment located at the port of houston  the port of beaumont and the tgs deepwater terminal located on the houston ship channel 
for all other terminal operations those owned during identical periods in both and  earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses increased million in  and million in  when compared to the respective prior years 
the increases in earnings represent net changes in terminal results at various locations  but the year over year increase in compared to was largely due to higher earnings in from our two large gulf coast liquids terminal facilities located along the houston ship channel in pasadena and galena park  texas 
the two terminals continued to benefit from both recent expansions that have added new liquids tank and truck loading rack capacity since  and incremental business from ethanol and biodiesel storage and transfer activity for the entire segment  our expansion projects and acquisitions completed since the end of have increased our liquids terminals leaseable capacity by  more than offsetting a less than drop in our overall utilization percentage 
higher earnings in also resulted from i the combined operations of our argo and chicago  illinois liquids terminals  due to increased ethanol throughput and incremental liquids storage and handling business  ii our texas petcoke terminals  due largely to higher petroleum coke throughput volumes at our port of houston facility  and iii our pier ix bulk terminal  located in newport news  virginia  largely due to a year to year increase in coal transfer volumes and higher rail incentives 
the increase in earnings in compared to from terminals owned during both years included higher earnings in from i our pasadena and galena park gulf coast liquids terminals  driven by higher revenues  in  from new and incremental customer agreements  additional liquids tank capacity from capital expansions completed at our pasadena terminal since the end of  higher truck loading rack service fees  higher ethanol throughput  and incremental revenues from customer deficiency charges  ii our shipyard river terminal  located in charleston  south carolina  due to higher revenues from liquids warehousing and coal and cement handling  iii our texas petcoke terminals  mainly resulting from an increase in petroleum coke handling volumes  and iv our lower mississippi river louisiana terminals  primarily due to incremental earnings from our amory and delisle mississippi bulk terminals 
our amory terminal began operations in july the higher earnings from our delisle terminal  which was negatively impacted by hurricane damage in  was primarily due to higher bulk transfer revenues in trans mountain year ended december  c in millions  except operating statistics revenues operating expenses other income expense a earnings from equity investments other  net income expense income tax benefit expense earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and amortization of excess cost of equity investments b transport volumes mmbbl a amount represents a goodwill impairment expense recorded by knight in the first quarter of b amount includes losses of million for periods prior to our acquisition date of april   and a million decrease in income from an oil loss allowance 
c amounts relate to periods prior to our acquisition date of april  see discussion below 
our trans mountain segment includes the operations of the trans mountain pipeline  which we acquired from knight effective april  trans mountain transports crude oil and refined products from edmonton  alberta to marketing terminals and refineries in british columbia and the state of washington 
an additional  barrel per day expansion that will increase capacity on the pipeline to approximately  barrels per day is currently under construction and is expected to be in service by late according to the provisions of generally accepted accounting principles that prescribe the standards used to account for business combinations  due to the fact that our acquisition of trans mountain from knight represented a transfer of assets between entities under common control  we initially recorded the assets and liabilities of trans mountain transferred to us from knight at their carrying amounts in the accounts of knight 
furthermore  our accompanying financial statements included in this report  and the information in the table above  reflect the results of operations for both and as though the transfer of trans mountain from knight had occurred at the beginning of the period january  for us 
after taking into effect the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above  the remaining increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in versus totaled million  and related entirely to our acquisition of trans mountain effective april  other year endeddecember  earnings increase decrease in millions income expense  except percentages general and administrative expenses a interest expense  net of unallocable interest income b unallocable income tax benefit expense minority interest c total interest and corporate administrative expenses year endeddecember  earnings increase decrease in millions income expense  except percentages general and administrative expenses a interest expense  net of unallocable interest income b minority interest c total interest and corporate administrative expenses a amount includes i a million increase in expense  allocated to us from knight  associated with closing the going private transaction

amount includes trans mountain expenses of million  a million increase in expense related to the cancellation of certain commercial insurance policies  and a million decrease in expense related to the allocation of general and administrative expenses on hurricane related capital expenditures for the replacement and repair of assets 
amount includes a million expense for a litigation settlement reached between us and a former joint venture partner on our kinder morgan tejas natural gas pipeline system  a cumulative million expense related to settlements of environmental matters at certain of our operating sites located in the state of california  and a million decrease in expense related to proceeds received in connection with the settlement of claims in the enron corp 
bankruptcy proceeding 
b amount includes a million increase in expense related to imputed interest on our cochin pipeline acquisition  and trans mountain expenses of million for periods prior to our acquisition date of april  amount includes trans mountain expenses of million 
c amount includes a million decrease in expense  related to the minority interest effect from all of the items listed in footnotes a and b 
amount includes a million increase in expense  primarily related to the minority interest effect from the property casualty insurance gain associated with the hurricane season 
items not attributable to any segment include general and administrative expenses  unallocable interest income and income tax expense  interest expense and minority interest 
our general and administrative expenses include such items as salaries and employee related expenses  payroll taxes  insurance  office supplies and rentals  unallocated litigation and environmental expenses  and shared corporate services including accounting  information technology  human resources and legal services 
compared to  the certain items described in footnote a to the tables above increased our general and administrative expenses by million 
the remaining million increase in expenses was largely due to i higher shared services expenses  which include legal  corporate secretary  tax  information technology and other shared services  and ii higher payroll related expenses resulting from the acquisitions and incremental expansions we have made since the end of compared to  the certain items described in footnote a decreased our general and administrative expenses by million 
the remaining million increase in overall general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to higher corporate service charges and higher corporate and employee related insurance expenses in the increase in corporate services was largely due to higher corporate overhead expenses associated with the business operations we acquired since the end of the increase in insurance expenses was partly due to incremental expenses related to the cancellation of certain commercial insurance polices  as well as to the overall variability in year to year commercial property and medical insurance costs 
pursuant to certain provisions that gave us the right to cancel certain commercial policies prior to maturity  we took advantage of the opportunity to reinsure at lower rates 
interest expense  net of unallocable interest income  totaled million in  million in and million in compared to  net interest expense decreased million in due to the items described in footnote b to the tables above 
the remaining million increase in expense in compared to was due to both a increase in average borrowing rates the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings was approximately during and during and a increase in average borrowings excluding the market value of interest rate swaps 
the increase in average borrowings was mainly due to capital spending in  and the acquisition of external assets and businesses since the end of we incurred incremental net interest expense of million in due to the inclusion of trans mountain  and the remaining million increase in expense in compared to was due to both higher average debt levels and higher effective interest rates 
in  average borrowings increased and the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings increased  when compared to the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings was approximately during and during 
generally  we initially fund both our capital spending including payments for pipeline project construction costs and our acquisition outlays from borrowings under our commercial paper program 
from time to time  we issue senior notes in order to refinance our commercial paper borrowings 
for more information on our capital expansion and acquisition expenditures  see liquidity and capital resources investing activities 
the year to year increases in our average borrowing rates in and reflect a general rise in variable interest rates since the end of we use interest rate swap agreements to help manage our interest rate risk 
the swaps are contractual agreements we enter into in order to transform a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long term fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
however  in a period of rising interest rates  these swaps will result in period to period increases in our interest expense 
for more information on our interest rate swaps  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
liquidity and capital resources capital structure we attempt to maintain a conservative overall capital structure  with a long term target mix of approximately equity and debt 
in addition to our results of operations  our debt and capital balances are affected by our financing activities  as discussed below in financing activities 
the following table illustrates the sources of our invested capital dollars in millions december  long term debt  excluding market value of interest rate swaps minority interest partners capital  excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss total capitalization short term debt  less cash and cash equivalents total invested capital capitalization long term debt  excluding market value of interest rate swaps minority interest partners capital  excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss invested capital total debt  less cash and cash equivalents and excluding market value of interest rate swaps partners capital and minority interest  excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are debt service  sustaining capital expenditures  expansion capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholders and general partner 
in addition to utilizing cash generated from operations  we could meet our cash requirements for expansion capital expenditures through borrowings under our credit facility  issuing short term commercial paper  long term notes or additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr with the proceeds from issuances of kmr shares 
in general  we expect to fund cash distributions and sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash and cash flows from operating activities  expansion capital expenditures and working capital deficits with retained cash resulting from including i units in the determination of cash distributions per unit but paying quarterly distributions on i units in additional i units rather than cash  additional borrowings  the issuance of additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr  interest payments with cash flows from operating activities  and debt principal payments with additional borrowings  as such debt principal payments become due  or by the issuance of additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr 
as a publicly traded limited partnership  our common units are attractive primarily to individual investors  although such investors represent a small segment of the total equity capital market 
we believe that some institutional investors prefer shares of kmr over our common units due to tax and other regulatory considerations 
we are able to access this segment of the capital market through kmr s purchases of i units issued by us with the proceeds from the sale of kmr shares to institutional investors 
as part of our financial strategy  we try to maintain an investment grade credit rating  which involves  among other things  the issuance of additional limited partner units in connection with our acquisitions and internal growth activities in order to maintain acceptable financial ratios 
on may   standard poor s rating services and moody s investors service each placed our ratings on credit watch pending the resolution of kmi s going private transaction 
on january   in anticipation of the buyout closing  s p downgraded us one level to bbb and removed our rating from credit watch with negative implications 
currently  our debt credit rating is still rated bbb by s p 
as previously noted by moody s in its credit opinion dated november   it downgraded our credit rating from baa to baa on may   following the closing of the going private transaction 
additionally  our rating was downgraded by fitch ratings from bbb to bbb on april  short term liquidity we employ a centralized cash management program that essentially concentrates the cash assets of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing 
our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries are concentrated  consolidated  or otherwise made available for use by other entities within our consolidated group 
we place no restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities  payment of inter company balances or the ability to upstream dividends to parent companies other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities 
however  our cash and the cash of our subsidiaries is not concentrated into accounts of knight or any company not in our consolidated group of companies  and knight has no rights with respect to our cash except as permitted pursuant to our partnership agreement 
furthermore  certain of our operating subsidiaries are subject to ferc enacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs 
ferc regulated entities subject to these rules must  among other things  place their cash management agreements in writing  maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements  and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 
our principal sources of short term liquidity are i our billion five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that matures august   ii our billion short term commercial paper program which is supported by our bank credit facility  with the amount available for borrowing under our credit facility being reduced by our outstanding commercial paper borrowings  and iii cash from operations discussed following 
borrowings under our five year credit facility can be used for general partnership purposes and as a backup for our commercial paper program 
the facility can be amended to allow for borrowings up to billion 
there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december  as of december   we had million of commercial paper outstanding 
we provide for additional liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity related to our commercial paper program and long term revolving credit facility 
after reduction for our outstanding commercial paper borrowings and letters of credit  the remaining available borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility was million as of december  as of december   our outstanding short term debt was million 
currently  we believe our liquidity to be adequate 
for more information on our commercial paper program and our credit facility  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
long term financing in addition to our principal sources of short term liquidity listed above  we could meet our cash requirements other than distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholders and general partner through issuing long term notes or additional common units  or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr with the proceeds from issuances of kmr shares 
we are subject  however  to changes in the equity and debt markets for our limited partner units and long term notes  and there can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for our limited partner units and or long term notes in the future 
if we were unable or unwilling to issue additional limited partner units  we would be required to either restrict potential future acquisitions or pursue other debt financing alternatives  some of which could involve higher costs or negatively affect our credit ratings 
our ability to access the public and private debt markets is affected by our credit ratings 
see capital structure above for a discussion of our credit ratings 
equity issuances on may   kmr issued  of its shares in a public offering at a price of per share 
the net proceeds from the offering were used by kmr to buy additional i units from us  and we received net proceeds of million for the issuance of  i units 
on december   we completed a public offering of  of our common units  including common units sold pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option  at a price of per unit  less commissions and underwriting expenses 
we received net proceeds of million for the issuance of these  common units 
we used the proceeds from each of these two equity issuances to reduce the borrowings under our commercial paper program 
in addition  pursuant to our purchase and sale agreement with trans global solutions  inc  we issued  common units in may to tgs to settle a purchase price liability related to our acquisition of bulk terminal operations from tgs in april as agreed between tgs and us  the units were valued at million 
on february   we completed an additional offering of  of our common units at a price of per unit in a privately negotiated transaction with two investors 
we received net proceeds of million for the issuance of these  common units  and we used the proceeds to reduce the borrowings under our commercial paper program 
debt issuances from time to time we issue long term debt securities 
all of our long term debt securities issued to date  other than those issued under our long term revolving credit facility or those issued by our subsidiaries and operating partnerships  generally have the same terms except for interest rates  maturity dates and prepayment premiums 
all of our outstanding debt securities are unsecured obligations that rank equally with all of our other senior debt obligations  however  a modest amount of secured debt has been incurred by some of our operating partnerships and subsidiaries 
our fixed rate notes provide that we may redeem the notes at any time at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date plus a make whole premium 
during  we completed three separate public offerings of senior notes 
we received proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  as follows million from a january  public offering of a total of billion in principal amount of senior notes  consisting of million of notes due february   and million of notes due february   million from a june  public offering of million in principal amount of senior notes due january   and million from an august  public offering of million in principal amount of senior notes due september  we used the proceeds from each of these three debt offerings to reduce the borrowings under our commercial paper program 
in addition  on august   we repaid million of senior notes that matured on that date 
as of december   our total liability balance due on the various series of our senior notes was  million  and the total liability balance due on the various borrowings of our operating partnerships and subsidiaries was million 
for additional information regarding our debt securities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
on february   we completed a public offering of senior notes 
we issued a total of million in principal amount of senior notes  consisting of million of notes due february   and million of notes due january  we received proceeds from the issuance of the notes  after underwriting discounts and commissions  of approximately million  and we used the proceeds to reduce the borrowings under our commercial paper program 
capital requirements for recent transactions during  our cash outlays for the acquisition of assets and investments totaled million 
we utilized our commercial paper program to fund our acquisitions 
we then reduced our short term borrowings with the proceeds from our issuances of additional limited partnership units and senior notes  as described above 
we intend to refinance the remainder of our current short term debt and any additional short term debt incurred during through a combination of long term debt  equity and the issuance of additional commercial paper to replace maturing commercial paper borrowings 
we are committed to maintaining a cost effective capital structure and we intend to finance new acquisitions using a mix of approximately equity financing and debt financing

f represents commitments for the purchase of plant  property and equipment as of december  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  million in  versus  million in the overall year to year increase of million in cash flow from operations principally consisted of a million increase in cash attributable to changes in the reserves related to the legal fees  transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities of our pipeline and terminal operations consisting of an incremental million non cash operating expense accrued in  and payments of million made in june to certain shippers on our pacific operations pipelines 
the expense was associated with a liability adjustment made in december  and the payments related to a settlement agreement reached in may that resolved certain challenges by complainants with regard to delivery tariffs and gathering enhancement fees at our pacific operations watson station  located in carson  california  a million increase in cash inflows relative to changes in i other non current assets and liabilities  including  among other things  incremental transportation and dock prepayments received from pipeline customers due primarily to timing differences  and ii other incremental non cash expenses  including higher non cash operating expenses in associated with environmental liability adjustments  and higher non cash general and administrative expenses related to the activities required to complete kmi s going private transaction with regard to the going private transaction expenses  we were required to recognize the full amounts allocated to us from knight as expense on our income statement  however  due to the fact that almost all of the allocated expenses were associated with the acceleration of cashouts of grants of both kmi restricted stock and options on kmi stock  we were not responsible for paying these buyout expenses  and accordingly  recognized the unpaid amount as both a contribution to partners capital and an increase to minority interest on our balance sheet  a million increase in cash inflows relative to net changes in working capital items  mainly due to timing differences that resulted in higher net cash inflows from the collection and payment of trade and related party receivables and payables  and from lower payments on accrued tax and interest liabilities  and a million decrease in cash from overall lower partnership income net of the following non cash items i depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  ii gains and losses on property sales and casualty indemnifications  iii earnings from equity investees  and iv a million goodwill impairment charge recognized in the first quarter of the increases and decreases in our partnership income in compared to are discussed above in results of operations 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the prior year 
the million overall increase in funds utilized in investing activities was primarily attributable to the following a million increase due to higher expenditures made for strategic business acquisitions 
in  our acquisition outlays for assets and investments totaled million  primarily consisting of million for net payments made to knight for our acquisition of the trans mountain pipeline system  million for the acquisition of bulk terminal assets from marine terminals  inc  and million for the purchase of the vancouver wharves bulk marine terminal 
in  our acquisition outlays totaled million  primarily consisting of million for the acquisition of entrega gas pipeline llc and million for the acquisition of bulk  liquids and refined products terminal operations and related assets 
both our and acquisition expenditures are discussed more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  a million increase from higher capital expenditures largely due to increased investments undertaken to expand and improve our bulk and liquids terminalling operations  and our trans mountain pipeline system 
our sustaining capital expenditures  defined as capital expenditures that do not increase the capacity of an asset  totaled million in and million in the above amounts do not include the sustaining capital expenditures of our trans mountain business segment for periods prior to our acquisition date of april  additionally  our forecasted expenditures for sustaining capital expenditures for are approximately million 
all of our capital expenditures  with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures  are discretionary  a million increase from incremental contributions to equity investments in  largely driven by incremental investments of million and million  respectively  for our proportionate share of construction costs of the rockies express and midcontinent express pipelines  and a million decrease in cash used due to higher net proceeds received from the sales of property  plant and equipment and other net assets net of salvage and removal costs 
the increase from sales proceeds in versus was driven by the approximately million we received for the sale of our north system operations in october in april  we received million from momentum energy group  llc for the combined sale of our douglas natural gas gathering system and painter unit fractionation facility  and in the first half of  we received million from the sale of certain oil and gas properties originally acquired from journey acquisition i  lp and journey  lp financing activities net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in  while in the prior year  our financing activities provided net cash of million 
the million overall increase in cash inflows provided by financing activities was primarily due to a million increase from overall debt financing activities which include our issuances and payments of debt and our debt issuance costs 
the year to year increase in cash from financing activities was primarily due to i a  million net increase in cash inflows from the issuances and payments of senior notes in  and ii a  million decrease in cash from lower overall net commercial paper borrowings in  relative to the decrease in commercial paper borrowings includes a decrease of million from borrowings under the commercial paper program of rockies express pipeline llc in the first half of we held and consolidated a ownership interest in rockies express pipeline llc until june  effective june   conocophillips exercised its option to acquire a ownership interest in westeast pipeline llc and its subsidiary rockies express pipeline llc  and westeast pipeline llc was then deconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
generally accepted accounting principles required us to include its cash inflows and outflows in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended june   however  following the change from full consolidation to the equity method  rockies express debt balances were not included in our consolidated balance sheet as of or subsequent to june  the  million increase in cash inflows from changes in senior notes outstanding was associated with public debt offerings completed on january   june  and august  on these dates  we completed offerings of billion  million and million  respectively  in principal amount of senior notes in four separate series i million of notes due february   ii million of notes due february   iii million of notes due january   and iv million of notes due september  combined  we received proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  of  million from these long term debt offerings and we used the proceeds from each of these offerings to reduce the borrowings under our commercial paper program 
in addition  on august   we repaid million of senior notes that matured on that date  a million increase from overall equity financing activities which include our issuances of limited partner units 
in may  we received proceeds of million  after commissions and underwriting expenses  for our issuance of  i units to kmr  and in december  we received net proceeds of million from a public offering of  common units 
in  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of additional common units  primarily related to our august public offering of  of our common units at a price of  less commissions and underwriting expenses 
we used the proceeds from each of these equity issuances to reduce the borrowings under our commercial paper program  and a million decrease from lower contributions from minority interests principally due to contributions of million received in from sempra energy with regard to their ownership interest in rockies express 
the contributions from sempra included an million contribution for its share of the purchase price of entrega gas pipeline llc  discussed above in investing activities 
partnership distributions our partnership agreement requires that we distribute of available cash  as defined in our partnership agreement  to our partners within days following the end of each calendar quarter in accordance with their respective percentage interests 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts  including cash received by our operating partnerships and net reductions in reserves  less cash disbursements and net additions to reserves and amounts payable to the former general partner of sfpp  lp in respect of its remaining interest in sfpp 
our general partner is granted discretion by our partnership agreement  which discretion has been delegated to kmr  subject to the approval of our general partner in certain cases  to establish  maintain and adjust reserves for future operating expenses  debt service  maintenance capital expenditures  rate refunds and distributions for the next four quarters 
these reserves are not restricted by magnitude  but only by type of future cash requirements with which they can be associated 
when kmr determines our quarterly distributions  it considers current and expected reserve needs along with current and expected cash flows to identify the appropriate sustainable distribution level 
for  and  we distributed approximately  and  respectively  of the total of cash receipts less cash disbursements calculations assume that kmr unitholders received cash 
the difference between these numbers and of distributable cash flow reflects net changes in reserves 
our general partner and owners of our common units and class b units receive distributions in cash  while kmr  the sole owner of our i units  receives distributions in additional i units 
we do not distribute cash to i unit owners but instead retain the cash for use in our business 
however  the cash equivalent of distributions of i units is treated as if it had actually been distributed for purposes of determining the distributions to our general partner 
each time we make a distribution  the number of i units owned by kmr and the percentage of our total units owned by kmr increase automatically under the provisions of our partnership agreement 
available cash is initially distributed to our limited partners and to our general partner 
these distribution percentages are modified to provide for incentive distributions to be paid to our general partner in the event that quarterly distributions to unitholders exceed certain specified targets 
available cash for each quarter is distributed first  to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  second  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  third  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  and fourth  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata  to owners of common units and class b units in cash and to owners of i units in the equivalent number of i units  and to our general partner 
incentive distributions are generally defined as all cash distributions paid to our general partner that are in excess of of the aggregate value of cash and i units being distributed 
our general partner s incentive distribution that we declared for was million  while the incentive distribution paid to our general partner during was million 
the difference between declared and paid distributions is due to the fact that our distributions for the fourth quarter of each year are declared and paid in the first quarter of the following year 
in addition  our general partner waived million of its incentive distribution for the fourth quarter of  which was paid in the first quarter of  in order to fund the annual bonus for employees 
on february   we paid a quarterly distribution of per unit for the fourth quarter of this distribution was greater than the distribution per unit we paid for both the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of we paid this distribution in cash to our common unitholders and to our class b unitholders 
kmr  our sole i unitholder  received additional i units based on the cash distribution per common unit 
we believe that future operating results will continue to support similar levels of quarterly cash and i unit distributions  however  no assurance can be given that future distributions will continue at such levels 
litigation and environmental as of december   we have recorded a total reserve for environmental claims  without discounting and without regard to anticipated insurance recoveries  in the amount of million 
in addition  we have recorded a receivable of million for expected cost recoveries that have been deemed probable 
the reserve is primarily established to address and clean up soil and ground water impacts from former releases to the environment at facilities we have acquired or accidental spills or releases at facilities that we own 
reserves for each project are generally established by reviewing existing documents  conducting interviews and performing site inspections to determine the overall size and impact to the environment 
reviews are made on a quarterly basis to determine the status of the cleanup and the costs associated with the effort 
in assessing environmental risks in conjunction with proposed acquisitions  we review records relating to environmental issues  conduct site inspections  interview employees  and  if appropriate  collect soil and groundwater samples 
as of december   our total reserve for environmental claims  without discounting and without regard to anticipated insurance recoveries  amounted to million 
additionally  as of december   we have recorded a total reserve for legal fees  transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities in the amount of million 
the reserve is primarily related to various claims from lawsuits arising from our pacific operations  and the contingent amount is based on both the circumstances of probability and reasonability of dollar estimates 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these claims in order to determine the adequacy of our liability provision  and in december  we recorded a non cash increase in operating expense of million related to our litigation matters 
as of december   our total reserve for legal fees  transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities amounted to million 
though no assurance can be given  we believe we have established adequate environmental and legal reserves such that the resolution of pending environmental matters and litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business  cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
pursuant to our continuing commitment to operational excellence and our focus on safe  reliable operations  we have implemented  and intend to implement in the future  enhancements to certain of our operational practices in order to strengthen our environmental and asset integrity performance 
these enhancements have resulted and may result in higher operating costs and sustaining capital expenditures  however  we believe these enhancements will provide us the greater long term benefits of improved environmental and asset integrity performance 
please refer to notes and of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding pending litigation and environmental matters  respectively 
regulation the pipeline safety improvement act of requires pipeline companies to perform integrity tests on natural gas transmission pipelines that exist in high population density areas that are designated as high consequence areas 
pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests within ten years of december   the date of enactment  and must perform subsequent integrity tests on a seven year cycle 
at least of the highest risk segments must be tested within five years of the enactment date 
the risk ratings are based on numerous factors  including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline  as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating 
testing will consist of hydrostatic testing  internal electronic testing  or direct assessment of the piping 
a similar integrity management rule for refined petroleum products pipelines became effective may  all baseline assessments for products pipelines must be completed by march  and we expect to meet this deadline 
we have included all incremental expenditures estimated to occur during associated with the pipeline safety improvement act of and the integrity management of our products pipelines in our budget and capital expenditure plan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk generally  our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 
our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity prices 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 
energy commodity market risk we are exposed to commodity market risk and other external risks  such as weather related risk  in the ordinary course of business 
however  we take steps to hedge  or limit our exposure to  these risks in order to maintain a more stable and predictable earnings stream 
stated another way  we execute a hedging strategy that seeks to protect our financial position against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses 
our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil 
the derivative contracts we use include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange and over the counter markets  including  but not limited to  futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps and basis swaps 
fundamentally  our hedging strategy involves taking a simultaneous position in the futures market that is equal and opposite to our position in the cash market or physical product in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change 
for example  as sellers of crude oil and natural gas  we often enter into fixed price swaps and or futures contracts to guarantee or lock in the sale price of our oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery  thereby directly offsetting any change in prices  either positive or negative 
a hedge is successful when gains or losses in the cash market are neutralized by losses or gains in the futures transaction 
our risk management policies prohibit us from engaging in speculative trading and we are not a party to leveraged derivatives 
furthermore  our policies require that we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors  and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties credit ratings 
while we enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we purchase energy commodity derivative contracts are as follows credit ratings per standard poor s rating services credit rating bnp paribas aa j 
aron company goldman sachs aa morgan stanley aa we account for our energy commodity risk management derivative contracts according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities after amendment by sfas no 
 sfas no 
 and sfas no 

according to the provisions of sfas no 
 derivatives are measured at fair value and recognized on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities  and in general  gains and losses on derivatives are reported on the income statement 
however  as discussed above  our principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil 
using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide us increased certainty with regard to our operating cash flows and helps us undertake further capital improvement projects  attain budget results and meet distribution targets to our partners 
sfas no 
categorizes such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges  because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but whose value is uncertain 
cash flow hedges are defined as hedges made with the intention of decreasing the variability in cash flows related to future transactions  as opposed to the value of an asset  liability or firm commitment  and sfas no 
prescribes special hedge accounting treatment for such derivatives 
in accounting for cash flow hedges  gains and losses on the derivative contracts are reported in other comprehensive income  outside net income reported in our consolidated statements of income  but only to the extent that the gains and losses from the change in value of the derivative contracts can later offset the loss or gain from the change in value of the hedged future cash flows during the period in which the hedged cash flows affect net income 
that is  for cash flow hedges  all effective components of the derivative contracts gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income  pending occurrence of the expected transaction 
other comprehensive income consists of those financial items that are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets but not included in our net income 
thus  in highly effective cash flow hedges  where there is no ineffectiveness  other comprehensive income changes by exactly as much as the derivative contracts and there is no impact on earnings 
all remaining gains and losses on the derivative contracts the ineffective portion are included in current net income 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts is the difference between the gain or loss from the change in value of the derivative contract and the effective portion of that gain or loss 
in addition  when the hedged forecasted transaction does take place and affects earnings  the effective part of the hedge is also recognized in the income statement  and the earlier recognized effective amounts are removed from accumulated other comprehensive loss 
if the forecasted transaction results in an asset or liability  amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss should be reclassified into earnings when the asset or liability affects earnings through cost of sales  depreciation  interest expense  etc 
under current accounting rules  the accumulated components of other comprehensive income are to be reported separately as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
for us  the gains and losses that are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets are primarily related to the derivative contracts associated with our hedging of anticipated future cash flows from the sales and purchases of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil and represent the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative contacts 
accordingly  the total accumulated other comprehensive loss included within the partners capital section of our accompanying balance sheets as of december  and december   included amounts associated with the commodity price risk management activities of  million and million  respectively 
in future periods  as the hedged cash flows from our actual purchases and sales of energy commodities affect our net income  the related gains and losses included in our accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of our hedging are transferred to the income statement as well  effectively offsetting the changes in cash flows stemming from the hedged risk 
we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil markets utilizing a value at risk model 
value at risk is a statistical measure of how much the mark to market value of a portfolio could change during a period of time  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we utilize a closed form model to evaluate risk on a daily basis 
the value at risk computations utilize a confidence level of for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day is chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk number presented 
derivative contracts evaluated by the model include commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options 
for each of the years ended december  and  our value at risk reached a high of million and million  respectively  and a low of million and million  respectively 
value at risk as of december   was million and averaged million for value at risk as of december   was million and averaged million for our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative contracts assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
in addition  as discussed above  we enter into these derivative contracts solely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and  therefore  the change in the market value of our portfolio of derivative contracts  with the exception of a minor amount of hedging inefficiency  is offset by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 
for more information on our risk management activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
interest rate risk in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure  it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
as of december  and  the carrying values of our fixed rate debt were approximately  million and  million  respectively 
these amounts compare to  as of december  and  fair values of  million and  million  respectively 
fair values were determined using quoted market prices  where applicable  or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
a hypothetical change approximately basis points in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for and  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair values of these instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of our variable rate debt  including associated accrued interest and excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements discussed below  was million as of december  and  million as of december  a hypothetical change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings  when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december  and  including adjustments for notional swap amounts  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in our and annual pre tax earnings 
as of december  and  we were a party to interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of billion and billion  respectively 
an interest rate swap agreement is a contractual agreement entered into between two counterparties under which each agrees to make periodic interest payments to the other for an agreed period of time based upon a predetermined amount of principal  which is called the notional principal amount 
normally at each payment or settlement date  the party who owes more pays the net amount  so at any given settlement date only one party actually makes a payment 
the principal amount is notional because there is no need to exchange actual amounts of principal 
we entered into our interest rate swap agreements for the purposes of i hedging the interest rate risk associated with our fixed rate debt obligations and ii transforming a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long term fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
since the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest  we enter into swap agreements to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest 
such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest  and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 
as of both december  and  all of our interest rate swap agreements represented fixed for variable rate swaps  where we agreed to pay our counterparties a variable rate of interest on a notional principal amount  comprised of principal amounts from various series of our long term fixed rate senior notes 
in exchange  our counterparties agreed to pay us a fixed rate of interest  thereby allowing us to transform our fixed rate liabilities into variable rate obligations without the incurrence of additional loan origination or conversion costs 
we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements 
in general  we attempt to maintain an overall target mix of approximately fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
as of december   our cash and investment portfolio did not include fixed income securities 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio
