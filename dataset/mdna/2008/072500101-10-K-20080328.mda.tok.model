item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if any of the following events actually occur  our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
bay national corporation and bay national bank depend heavily on one key employee  mr 
hugh w 
mohler  and business would suffer if something were to happen to mr 
mohler 
mr 
mohler is the chairman  president and chief executive officer of bay national bank 
if he were to leave for any reason  bay national corporation s and bay national bank s business would suffer because he has banking experience and relationships with clients and potential clients that would not be easy to replace 
in addition  because bay national bank s business is relationship driven  the loss of an employee who has primary contact with one or more of bay national bank s clients could cause bay national bank to lose those clients business  possibly resulting in a decline in revenues 
if our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses  we review and evaluate  among other things  our loans and our loss and delinquency experience and current economic conditions 
if our assumptions are incorrect  our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to our allowance 
we are particularly susceptible to this risk because we have experienced significant growth in our residential real estate loan portfolio over the past few years 
in general  loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time  a process referred to as seasoning 
as a result  a portfolio of older loans will usually behave more predictably than a newer portfolio 
because our residential real estate loan portfolio is not significantly seasoned and there has been a downturn in the residential real estate market  the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not be representative of the level that will prevail when the portfolio becomes more seasoned or if the condition of the residential real estate market does not improve 
if delinquencies and defaults continue to increase  we may be required to further increase our provision for credit losses 
material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge offs may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
bay national bank s lending strategy involves risks resulting from the choice of loan portfolio 
bay national bank s loan strategy emphasizes commercial business loans and commercial real estate loans 
at december   such loans accounted for approximately of the loan portfolio 
commercial business and commercial real estate loans generally carry a higher degree of credit risk than do residential mortgage loans because of several factors including larger loan balances  dependence on the successful operation of a business or a project for repayment  or loan terms with a balloon payment rather than full amortization over the loan term 
bay national bank s lending limit may limit its growth and the growth of bay national corporation 
bay national bank is limited in the amount it can loan to a single borrower by the amount of its capital 
specifically  under current law  bay national bank may lend up to of its unimpaired capital and surplus to any one borrower 
bay national bank s lending limit is significantly less than that of many of its competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of bay national bank s lending limit from conducting business with bay national bank 
bay national bank faces substantial competition which could adversely affect its ability to attract depositors and borrowers 
bay national bank operates in a competitive market for financial services and faces intense competition from other institutions both in making loans and in attracting deposits 
many of these institutions have been in business for many years  are significantly larger  have established customer bases  have greater financial resources and lending limits than bay national bank  and are able to offer certain services that bay national bank is not able to offer 
if bay national bank cannot attract deposits and make loans at a sufficient level  its operating results will suffer  as will its opportunities for growth 
government regulation could restrict bay national corporation s or bay national bank s growth or cause bay national corporation or bay national bank to incur higher costs 
bay national corporation and bay national bank operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to examination  supervision and comprehensive regulation by several federal and state regulatory agencies 
banking regulations  designed primarily for the safety of depositors  may limit the growth of bay national bank and the return to investors by restricting activities such as the payment of dividends  mergers with  or acquisitions by  other institutions  investments  loans and interest rates  interest rates paid on deposits  and the creation of branch offices 
laws and regulations could change at any time  and changes could adversely affect bay national corporation s and bay national bank s business 
in addition  the cost of compliance with regulatory requirements could adversely affect bay national corporation s and bay national bank s ability to operate profitably 
bay national bank s ability to compete may suffer if it cannot take advantage of technology to provide banking services or if its customers fail to embrace that technology 
bay national bank s business strategy relies less on customers access to a large branch network and more on access to technology and personal relationships 
further  the market for financial services is increasingly affected by advances in technology  including developments in telecommunications  data processing  computers  automation  internet based banking and tele banking 
bay national bank s ability to compete successfully may depend on the extent to which bay national bank can take advantage of technological changes and the extent to which bay national bank s customers embrace technology to complete their banking transactions 
because we currently serve limited market areas  we could be more adversely affected by an economic downturn in our market areas than our larger competitors who are more geographically diverse 
currently  our primary market area is limited to the baltimore metropolitan area  the baltimore washington corridor and maryland s eastern shore 
if either of these areas suffer an economic downturn  our business and financial condition may be severely affected 
our larger competitors serve a more geographically diverse market area  parts of which may not be affected by the same economic conditions that exist in our primary market areas 
if economic conditions deteriorate  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected as borrowers ability to repay loans declines and the value of the collateral securing our loans decreases 
our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions  including decreases in real estate values  changes in interest rates which may cause a decrease in interest rate spreads  adverse employment conditions  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and other significant external events 
because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate related loans  decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral 
adverse changes in the economy also may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on our earnings 
our profitability depends on interest rates and changes in monetary policy may impact us 
our results of operations depend to a large extent on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  such as interest on deposit accounts  and the interest income received from our interest earning assets  such as loans 
interest rates  because they are influenced by  among other things  expectations about future events  including the level of economic activity  federal monetary and fiscal policy and geo political stability  are not predictable or controllable 
in addition  competitive factors heavily influence the interest rates we can earn on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest rates we pay on our deposits 
community banks are often at a competitive disadvantage in managing their cost of funds compared to the large regional  super regional or national banks that have access to the national and international capital markets 
these factors influence our ability to maintain a stable interest margin 
the costs of being a public company are proportionately higher for small companies like us due to the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission have increased the scope  complexity  and cost of corporate governance  reporting  and disclosure practices 
these regulations are applicable to our company 
we expect to experience increasing compliance costs  including costs related to internal controls  as a result of the sarbanes oxley act 
these necessary costs are proportionately higher for a company of our size and will affect our profitability more than that of some of our larger competitors

amounts previously reported have been adjusted to reflect a to stock split in the form of a stock dividend recorded on june  sales price range bid or sales price range quarter low high low high st nd rd th bay national corporation declared a stock dividend in april payable on june  to stockholders of record on june  management anticipates that bay national corporation will retain all earnings  if any  in order to provide more funds to operate and expand bay national corporation s business and  therefore  bay national corporation has no plans to pay any cash dividends at least until its profitability exceeds the level necessary to support capital growth in excess of regulatory capital needs 
if bay national corporation decides to pay dividends in the future  its ability to do so will depend on the ability of bay national bank to pay dividends to bay national corporation 
in addition  management would consider a number of other factors before deciding to pay dividends  including bay national corporation s earnings prospects  financial condition and cash needs 
the amount of dividends that may be paid by bay national bank to bay national corporation depends on bay national bank s earnings and capital position and is limited by statute  regulations and regulatory policies

this discussion and analysis provides an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of bay national corporation parent and its national bank subsidiary  bay national bank bank  collectively the company  as of december  and and for the years ended december   and certain reclassifications have been made to amounts previously reported to conform to the classifications made in general the parent was incorporated on june  under the laws of the state of maryland to operate as a bank holding company of the bank 
the bank commenced operations on may  the principal business of the company is to make loans and other investments and to accept time and demand deposits 
the company s primary market areas are in the baltimore metropolitan area  baltimore washington corridor and on maryland s eastern shore  although the company s business development efforts generate business outside of these areas 
the company offers a broad range of banking products  including a full line of business and personal savings and checking accounts  money market demand accounts  certificates of deposit  and other banking services 
the company funds a variety of loan types including commercial and residential real estate loans  commercial term loans and lines of credit  consumer loans  and letters of credit with an emphasis on meeting the borrowing needs of small businesses 
the company s target customers are small and mid sized businesses  business owners  professionals and high net worth individuals 
overview the company s growth moderated in and operating results declined due to deterioration of the economic environment and industry wide problems in residential real estate lending 
as such  management continues to emphasize prudent asset liability management and it has significantly tightened its underwriting standards for residential real estate loans 
key measurements for the year ended december  include the following total assets at december  increased by to million as compared to million as of december  net loans outstanding increased by from million as of december  to million as of december  there was approximately million in non accrual loans as of december  in addition  the company foreclosed on three pieces of investor owned residential real estate during the third quarter of these properties were placed into other real estate owned at estimated net realizable value of approximately million 
there were no other non performing assets as of december  deposits at december  were million  a decrease of million or from december  the company realized net income of  for the year ended december  this compares to net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in the results of the year ended december  was income tax expense of  compared to million recorded in net income for the year ended december  included an income tax benefit of  net interest income  the company s main source of income  was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this represents a decrease of over and an increase of over net loan charge offs were  for the year ended december  the company added million to the allowance for credit losses during the fourth quarter of primarily due to weaknesses in its portfolio of investor owned residential construction and reconstruction loans resulting from problems in the housing market in its target markets 
net loan charge offs were  for the year ended december  and there were no charge offs for the year ended december  non interest income for the year ended december  decreased by  or  as compared to the year ended december  and by  or  as compared to the year ended december  non interest expense increased by  or  and million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the years ended december  and  respectively 
the market price of our common stock ended the year at  down from the closing price of on december  during the third and fourth quarter of  the company added four seasoned commercial bankers  a cash management specialist and a commercial account manager to lead its expansion into the baltimore washington corridor 
the company will continue to pursue expansion into this and other markets  however  this strategy may have a short term impact on operating results 
a detailed discussion of the factors leading to these changes can be found in the discussion below 
results of operations overview the company recorded net income of  for the year ended december  this compares to million reported for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the company reported net income of million for the year ended december  the decrease in year over year results is primarily due to a highly competitive market that has made revenue growth difficult  a million provision for credit losses during the fourth quarter of primarily due to the slowdown in the residential real estate market  and an increase in non interest expenses 
bay national bank s mortgage origination operations  located in towson and salisbury  maryland  originate conventional first and second lien residential mortgage loans and construction and rehabilitation loans 
bay national bank sells most of its first and second lien residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and typically recognizes a gain on the sale of these loans after the payment of commissions to the loan origination officer 
since its inception in february  the salisbury mortgage division has been a significant contributor to operating results 
the towson mortgage operation was initiated in february and began to contribute to the company s overall profitability during the second half of for the years ended december   and  gains on the sale of mortgage loans totaled   and  respectively 
gains on the sale of mortgage loans decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due to a slowdown in the real estate markets in the company s primary market areas 
the level of gains on the sale of mortgage loans increased in as compared to due to the addition of the towson origination operation  which focuses on construction and rehabilitation loans that will be modified to permanent financing upon completion of the project 
the permanent financing is then sold in the secondary market 
in  the company introduced a new loan program for conventional first lien and second lien residential mortgage loans 
under this program  the company purchases a participation in mortgage loans originated by a mortgage company in the baltimore metropolitan area 
these participations are for loans which a secondary market investor has committed to purchase 
the participations are typically held for a period of three to four weeks before being sold to the secondary market investor 
this holding period represents the amount of time taken by the secondary market investor to review the loan files for completeness and accuracy 
during this holding period  the company earns interest on these loans at a rate indexed to the prime rate 
the primary risk to the company from this program is that the secondary market investor may decline to purchase the loans due to documentary deficiencies or errors 
the company attempts to manage this risk by conducting a thorough review of the documentation prior to purchasing the participation 
if the secondary market investor declines to purchase the loan  the company could attempt to sell the loan to other investors or hold the loan in its loan portfolio 
as of december   the company had million of loans outstanding under this program  which are classified as held for sale 
the company earned  of interest on this program during   during and  during the activity in this program declined significantly in as the originating mortgage company utilized other available funding sources 
earnings and asset growth were a challenge in as a result of the slowing economy and the company s need to continue to invest in personnel to support its long term growth 
management also expects to face this challenge in actual results will be subject to the volatility of the provision for credit losses  which is related to loan growth  the volatility of volume in the mortgage participations purchasing program  the volatility of mortgage loan production  which is sensitive to economic and interest rate fluctuations and other competitive pressures that arise in a slowing economy 
net interest income margins net interest income is the difference between income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets 
earning assets are composed primarily of loans  investments  and federal funds sold 
interest bearing deposits and other borrowings make up the cost of funds 
non interest bearing deposits and capital are also funding sources 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources along with changes in associated interest rates determine changes in net interest income 
interest income from loans and investments for the year ended december  was million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase over  and the increase over  is directly related to the increase in average interest earning assets from and the increase in average interest earning assets from the change in interest income was also impacted by changes in average yields due to a rising interest rate environment in and and a declining interest rate environment in the yields on these assets rose from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  and declined to for the year ended december  the percentage of average interest earning assets represented by loans was  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the average yield on the loan portfolio was  as compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  loan yields declined from primarily due to three reductions in the target federal funds rate during  from effective june  to at december  loan yields increased from to primarily as a result of twelve increases in the target federal funds rate  from at december  to effective june  as can be seen by the yields discussed above  these fluctuations had a significant impact on the company s operating results 
the timing and amount of the impact on loan yields of changes to the federal funds rates varies from period to period as a result of differences in the mix of fixed rate loans to variable rate loans at any point in time 
the average yield on the investment portfolio and other earning assets such as federal funds sold was for the year ended december  as compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in the average yields were a direct result of the federal reserve actions discussed above as well as an increase in the holdings of federal reserve and federal home loan bank of atlanta stocks  which pay dividend yields greater than the prevailing federal funds rate 
the percentage of average interest earning assets represented by investments was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense from deposits and borrowings for the year ended december  was million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase over and the increase over are directly related to the increase in average interest bearing liabilities from and the increase in average interest bearing liabilities from interest expense was also impacted by changes in average rates paid due to federal reserve actions discussed above 
the average rates paid on these liabilities changed from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  management observed ongoing pressure to pay higher rates on deposits as the market for funds has become more competitive 
in addition  the market is very competitive for loans  which  as is typical  has created downward pressure on loan pricing 
the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  information regarding the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the amount of interest income and interest expense  and the resulting yields on average interest earning assets and rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities 
average balances are also provided for non interest earning assets and non interest bearing liabilities 
no tax equivalent adjustments were made and no interest income was exempt from federal income taxes 
all average balances are daily average balances 
the average balances of non accrual loans are included in the average loan balances for the periods indicated

the calculation of rate  volume and rate volume variances is based on a procedure established for bank holding companies by the securities and exchange commission

this slowdown resulted in an increase in loan extensions and delinquencies due to the inability of investors to resell properties as quickly as anticipated 
more specifically  the company experienced weaknesses in its portfolio of investor owned residential construction and reconstruction loans  which totaled approximately million of which million was classified as non accrual as of december  in addition  the company foreclosed on three pieces of investor owned residential real estate during the third quarter of for additional information on nonperforming loans  see the management discussion and analysis section entitled nonperforming loans and other delinquent assets 
management is aggressively addressing the problems in this portfolio  however  resolving these issues will take time as the residential real estate market works through its downturn and housing inventories return to normal levels 
as such  there can be no assurance that management s actions will result in decreases in the rate of non accrual and past due loans 
the provision for was higher than due to the fact that an additional  provision was established in the fourth quarter of as a result of the downgrading of one credit 
for additional information regarding the methodology used to determine the provision for credit losses see the management discussion and analysis section entitled allowance for credit losses and credit risk management 
non interest income non interest income consists primarily of gains on the sale of mortgage loans  deposit account service charges and cash management fees 
for the year ended december   the company realized non interest income in the amount of  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gains on the sale of mortgage loans of  represented of non interest income for the year ended december  this compares to gains on the sale of mortgage loans of  or  of total non interest income for the year ended december  and  or  of total non interest income for the year ended december  the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was due to a general decline in home purchase and refinance activity in the company s markets 
the level of gains on the sale of mortgage loans increased from to because the company added additional residential construction and mortgage capabilities with the opening of the towson mortgage operation in february this was achieved through the hiring of a team of eight individuals  including originators  processors and servicers who have extensive experience in the industry and the company s market area 
service charges on deposit accounts totaled  for the year ended december   as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this represents an increase of over and a decrease of compared to the increase over was primarily due to an increase in the level of analysis fees charged on transaction accounts 
the decrease from can be primarily attributed to a decline in the level of overdraft fees charged on transaction accounts 
other income totaled  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these represent increases of and over and  respectively 
these increases were primarily driven by the company s investment in bank owned life insurance boli which was purchased during the fourth quarter of the initial investment totaled million and the company recognized income of  related to increases in this investment during the year ended december  the company will continue to seek ways to expand its sources of non interest income 
in the future  the company may enter into fee arrangements with strategic partners that offer investment advisory services  risk management and employee benefit services 
no assurance can be given that such fee arrangements will be obtained or maintained 
non interest expense the components of non interest expense were as follows years ended december  salaries and employee benefits occupancy expenses furniture and equipment expenses legal and professional fees data processing and other outside services advertising and marketing related expenses other expenses total non interest expenses compared to non interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of  or  was primarily due to increases in other expenses  data processing and other outside services and occupancy expenses 
salaries and employee benefit expenses represented and of non interest expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
salaries and benefits marginally increased by  or 
the bank experienced staffing growth during in commercial account portfolio managers  commercial lenders and other operations support 
in addition  the company added four commercial bankers  a cash management specialist and a commercial account manager during the second half of the year to lead expansion into the baltimore washington corridor 
these additions were made to continue to expand its market presence  as well as to manage the growth of the loan and deposit portfolios and support increased operational volume 
the company s strategy to continue to pursue additional markets may have a short term impact on operating results 
the increased expense related to this staffing growth was offset by a decrease in accrued bonuses based on the company s financial performance and a decrease in commissions based on the industry wide slow down in residential real estate lending 
occupancy expenses increased by  or  due in part to scheduled rent increases  the acquisition of new space obtained during the fourth quarter of for the company s towson residential lending operation and assumption of first floor space that had previously been sublet at the bank s baltimore location 
legal and professional fees increased  or  during the increase was related to legal fees incurred in connection with the drafting of a stock incentive plan  increased costs associated with drafting the annual report and proxy materials  and increased legal fees incurred to help manage and workout loans in the company s residential real estate portfolio

the banking industry utilizes the efficiency ratio as a key measure of expense management and overall operating efficiency 
this ratio is computed by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income before the loan loss provision and non interest income 
the company s efficiency ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ending december  the increase in the efficiency ratio from the prior year is a result of management s decision to continue to invest in personnel to support the long term growth of the company 
approximately of the occupancy costs in were paid to directors of bay national corporation or entities controlled by directors of bay national corporation 
management believes that the terms of these leases are at least as favorable as could be obtained from independent third parties 
however  management has not conducted a recent market analysis to confirm this 
for a discussion of the terms of the leases with these persons  see item certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence 
compared to non interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefit expenses  which represented and of non interest expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
salaries and benefits increased by million  or  which was related to staffing growth  including the addition of a senior credit officer in january and a senior business development officer in june  as well as staffing growth in residential real estate lending  private banking  commercial account portfolio managers and other operational support 
these additions were made to continue to expand the bank s market presence  as well as to manage the growth of the loan and deposit portfolios and support increased operational volume 
occupancy expenses increased by  or  due in part to scheduled rent increases and increased rental expenses associated with new space obtained to accommodate a larger baltimore banking office and the towson mortgage operation 
legal and professional fees increased  or  resulting from legal fees incurred in connection with the drafting of executive employment agreements and legal assistance with the development of a commercial paper program  as well as an increase in internal and external audit fees related to company growth and management s desire to more frequently assess more complex functions such as information technology controls and residential lending compliance

advertising and marketing related expenses increased  or  which was related to an increase in the number of marketing events conducted and the number of business development professionals 
the increase of  or  in all other expenses relates to various costs associated with the increased size and complexity of the company 
the company s efficiency ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ending december  the increase from the prior year was driven by increased expenses not matching up to revenue growth 
income taxes for the year ended december   the company recorded income tax expense of  compared to  recorded for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in taxable income for the period 
for financial reporting purposes  taxable income for the year ended december  was offset by the company s net operating loss carryforwards available in that year 
the liability was offset by the recognition of a deferred tax asset of  resulting in the net tax benefit of  for the year ended december  at december   the company continues to have approximately million of maryland net operating loss carryforwards a possible net tax benefit of  for the unconsolidated state tax return for bay national corporation 
unless bay national corporation generates income from its own operations ie  unrelated to bay national bank  these operating loss carryforwards will expire in and financial condition composition of the balance sheet total assets of the company were million as of december   compared to total assets of million as of december  this represents marginal growth of approximately million  or  since december  deposits at december  were million as compared to deposits of million at december  the decline in deposits was primarily attributed to an million decrease in interest bearing deposits which was offset by a million increase in national market certificates of deposit 
as of december   loans including loans held for sale net of a million allowance for credit losses  totaled million 
this represents an increase of million  or  from december  this growth is a result of expansion into the baltimore washington corridor and an increase in activity under the program where the company purchases participations in mortgage loans originated by a mortgage company in the baltimore metropolitan area 
a total of approximately million in loans that were outstanding as of december  were paid off during this activity  combined with normal fluctuations in revolving credit balances and installment payments on amortizing loans  offset most of the approximately million in new loans  excluding loans held for sale  funded during that same period 
during  the company funded approximately million in mortgage loans held for sale of which approximately million were subsequently sold in the secondary market 
the composition of the loan portfolio as of december  was approximately million of commercial loans excluding real estate loans  million of consumer loans and million of real estate loans excluding million of mortgage loans held for sale 
the composition of the loan portfolio as of december  was approximately million of commercial loans excluding real estate loans  million of consumer loans and million of real estate loans excluding million of mortgage loans held for sale 
the overall growth in the loan portfolio and specifically the increased concentration in commercial loans are a direct result of the expansion into the baltimore washington corridor as well as the marketing efforts of bank employees  members of the board of directors and the baltimore and salisbury advisory boards 
the company has experienced weakness in its portfolio of investor owned residential construction and reconstruction loans 
this total portfolio as of december  was approximately million of which million was classified as non accrual 
management is proactively and aggressively addressing the problems in this portfolio by reviewing the specific credits more frequently  consulting with legal counsel when necessary  working with borrowers for potential restructure or working with potential investors to facilitate the sale of the property 
in addition  the company has significantly tightened underwriting standards for these types of loans and is currently originating very little of this business 
resolving these issues will take time as the residential real estate market works through its downturn and housing inventories return to normal levels  and there can be no assurance that management s actions will result in decreases in the rate of non accrual and past due loans 
during the third quarter of  the company foreclosed on three pieces of investor owned residential real estate 
these properties were placed into other real estate owned at estimated net realizable value of approximately million 
the difference between the related loan balances totaling approximately million and the net realizable value was charged off to the allowance for credit losses during that period 
prior to these foreclosures  the company had no other real estate owned 
based on review of estimates of current market values for these properties  the company recorded a provision of  in december the company will continue to emphasize prudent growth through the hiring of experienced commercial lenders and the development and use of referral sources including accountants  lawyers and existing customers  as well as members of the board of directors and the baltimore and salisbury advisory boards 
funds not extended in loans are held in cash and due from banks  and various investments including federal funds sold and other overnight investments  united states treasury securities  federal reserve bank stock and federal home loan bank stock 
these investments totaled million as of december  compared to million as of december  other than the investments in federal reserve bank stock and federal home loan bank stock  totaling million and million at december  and  respectively  all investments have maturities of days or less 
the treasury securities are used to collateralize municipal deposits and repurchase agreements which are classified as short term borrowings under which  was outstanding as of december  there were no outstanding repurchase agreements as of december  management has made a decision to maintain liquidity in the investment portfolio in order to ensure that funds are readily available to fund the growth of the loan portfolio or to fund the maturity of higher cost national time deposits 
total capital at december  was million as compared to million at december  the increase in capital is primarily a result of the positive operating results for the year ended december  composition of loan portfolio because yields on loans typically exceed the yields on investments  the company s business strategy is to continue to increase the overall level of loans  as well as maintain a relatively high percentage of loans to total earning assets 
increasing loans and loans as a percentage of total earning assets will maximize the net interest margin 
as of december  and  loans represented and of total earning assets  respectively

the company s loan portfolio composition as of december  reflects a concentration in variable rate loans 
loans held for sale represented of the company s loan portfolio 
fixed rate loans totaled million  or  of the company s loan portfolio 
interest rates on variable rate loans adjust to the current interest rate environment  whereas fixed rates do not allow this flexibility 
loans held for sale are expected to be sold in three months or less and as a result are not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations 
if interest rates were to increase in the future  the interest earned on the variable rate loans would improve  and  if rates were to fall  the interest earned would decline 
see liquidity and interest rate sensitivity 
the officers and directors of the company  including their related companies  had outstanding loans from the bank of million at december  and million at december  all loans made to officers and directors  including their related companies  are made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unaffiliated third parties and do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
allowance for credit losses and credit risk management originating loans involves a degree of risk that credit losses will occur in varying amounts according to  among other factors  the type of loans being made  the credit worthiness of the borrowers over the term of the loans  the quality of the collateral for the loan  if any  as well as general economic conditions 
the company charges the provision for credit losses to earnings to maintain the total allowance for credit losses at a level considered by management to represent its best estimate of the losses known and inherent in the portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate  based on  among other factors  prior loss experience  volume and type of lending conducted  estimated value of any underlying collateral  economic conditions particularly as such conditions relate to the company s market area  regulatory guidance  peer statistics  management s judgment  past due loans in the loan portfolio  loan charge off experience and concentrations of risk if any 
the company charges losses on loans against the allowance when it is believed that collection of loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are added back to the allowance 
management uses a loan grading system where all loans are graded based on management s evaluation of the risk associated with each loan 
a factor  based on the loan grading  is applied to the loan balance to reserve for potential losses 
in addition  management judgmentally establishes an additional nonspecific reserve 
the nonspecific portion of the allowance reflects management s estimate of probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
the reserve factors used are based on management s judgment as to appropriate reserve percentages for various categories of loans  and management adjusts those values based on the following historical losses in each category  historical and current delinquency in each category  underwriting standards in each category  comparison of losses and delinquencies to peer group performance and an assessment of the likely impact of economic and other external conditions on the performance of each category 
a test of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is performed and reported to the board of directors on a monthly basis 
management uses the information available to make a determination with respect to the allowance for credit losses  recognizing that the determination is inherently subjective and that future adjustments may be necessary depending upon  among other factors  a change in economic conditions of specific borrowers or generally in the economy and new information that becomes available 
however  there are no assurances that the allowance for credit losses will be sufficient to absorb losses on nonperforming assets or that the allowance will be sufficient to cover losses on nonperforming assets in the future 
the allowance for credit losses as of december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the amount equates to and of outstanding loans  including loans held for sale  as of december  and  respectively 
the increased percentage was due to a provision of million recorded in the fourth quarter of from weaknesses in the company s portfolio of investor owned residential construction and reconstruction loans 
this is a direct result of weaknesses in the housing markets in its target markets 
bay national corporation has no exposure to foreign countries or foreign borrowers 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate for each period presented 
the following table represents an analysis of the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the periods presented balance at beginning of year provision for credit losses loan charge offs commercial real estate construction consumer loan recoveries commercial real estate construction net recoveries charge offs balance at end of year the following table presents the allocation of the allowance for credit losses  reflecting use of the methodology presented above for the periods presented amount real estate home equity line of credit real estate construction real estate mortgage loans held for sale commercial consumer unallocated total allowance the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses decreased in this occurred because the company calculates an overall reserve level while the underlying portfolio experienced a moderate shift in the mix of loans by risk grade and the real estate market softened in the company s primary market areas 
the shift in the mix of loans by risk grade is a normal result of the addition of new loans  the decrease in balances of more mature loans and the ongoing reassessment of all loans 
the following table sets forth the percentages of loans in each category for the company s loan portfolio as of december      and  respectively 
real estate home equity line of credit real estate construction real estate mortgage loans held for sale commercial consumer total loans nonperforming loans and other delinquent assets management performs reviews of all delinquent loans 
management will generally classify loans as non accrual when collection of full principal and interest under the original terms of the loan is not expected or payment of principal or interest has become days past due 
classifying a loan as non accrual results in the company no longer accruing interest on such loan and reversing any interest previously accrued but not collected 
a non accrual loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected 
the company will recognize interest on non accrual loans only when received 
as of december   the company had million of non accrual loans 
the company did not have any non accrual loans outstanding as of december  any property acquired by the company as a result of foreclosure on a mortgage loan will be classified as real estate owned and will be recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance or fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
any required write down of the loan to its net realizable value will be charged against the allowance for credit losses 
upon foreclosure  the company generally will require an appraisal of the property and  thereafter  appraisals of the property on at least an annual basis with external inspections on at least a quarterly basis 
as of december  the company held  of real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure  which is net of a provision of  for estimated losses in market value 
the company applies the provisions of statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosure 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
require that impaired loans  which consist of all modified loans and other loans for which collection of all contractual principal and interest is not probable  be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  an impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance and corresponding provision for credit losses 
the company considers consumer loans as homogenous loans and thus does not apply the sfas no 
impairment test to these loans 
impaired loans will be written off when collection of the loan is doubtful 
as of december   the company had impaired loans totaling million  all of which were included in its investor owned residential real estate construction loan portfolio  were classified as non accrual loans and were over days past due 
this is a direct result of the slowdown in the real estate market  which has resulted in an increase in loan extensions and delinquencies due to the inability of investors to resell properties as quickly as anticipated 
these nonperforming loans represented of total outstanding loans  including loans held for sale  as of december  all of these loans are at least partially collateralized by real estate 
as of december  the company had one non accrual loan with a fully paid principal balance and unpaid fees of approximately  management will continue to closely monitor these loans and the overall level of delinquencies  however  management believes that the allowance for credit losses is adequate for these loans 
the respective allowance for credit losses on impaired loans was approximately million and  as of december  and  respectively 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and no income had been accrued or collected on these loans while they had been classified as impaired 
if these impaired loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  the company would have recognized interest income of approximately  and  for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
the company recognized interest income on impaired loans as of december  as the respective loans were not classified as non accrual as of that date 
any losses on these loans will be charged off as soon as the amount of loss is determinable 
investment portfolio the company has chosen to invest its available funds primarily in federal funds sold and other overnight investments 
as a result  investment securities as of december   consisted of  of federal reserve bank stock   of federal home loan bank stock and  of us treasury securities which mature within three months 
investment securities for the year ended december   consisted of  of federal reserve bank stock   of federal home loan bank stock and  of us treasury securities which mature within three months 
the company had no investments that were obligations of the issuer  or payable from or secured by a source of revenue or taxing authority of the issuer  whose aggregate book value exceeded of stockholders equity at december  the following table reflects the amortized cost  estimated fair value and weighted average yield of the investment portfolio as of december amortized cost estimated fair value weighted average yield us treasury securities due within one year other equity securities total investments amortized cost estimated fair value weighted average yield us treasury securities due within one year other equity securities total investments management has made the decision to maintain its available funds in highly liquid assets because it wishes to ensure that funds are readily available to fund the growth of the loan portfolio 
management believes that this strategy will allow the company to maximize interest margins while maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity 
sources of funds general deposits  short term borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements  short term borrowings under an overnight commercial paper program  short term borrowings under secured and unsecured lines of credit  borrowings under the subordinated debt  scheduled amortization and prepayment of loans  funds provided by operations and capital are the current sources of funds utilized by the company for lending and investment activities  and other general business purposes 
deposits the company offers a variety of deposit products having a range of interest rates and terms 
the company s deposits consist of checking accounts  savings accounts  money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
the following table sets forth the composition of the company s deposits as of december  and december  demand deposits savings money market and sweep certificates of deposit total deposits the mix of deposits shifted to a higher concentration of demand deposits and money market and sweep accounts and a decreased concentration in savings and certificates of deposit in compared to the increased concentration in demand deposits was primarily a function of a decline in total deposits 
savings accounts decreased approximately million from due to one customer s decision to move money to a money market account 
the approximate million decline in money market and sweep accounts was primarily driven by the shift to the company s newly created overnight commercial paper program 
certificates of deposit accounts declined by approximately million due to scheduled maturities and management s decision not to aggressively compete for deposits during as adequate liquidity was available to fund loan growth 
of the total deposits at december   million  or  was related to one customer as compared to million  or  at december  for this same customer 
the deposits for this large customer tend to fluctuate significantly  as a result  management monitors these deposits on a daily basis to ensure that liquidity levels are adequate to compensate for these fluctuations 
the following table sets forth the maturity distribution for the company s deposits at december  some of the deposits may be renewed or withdrawn prior to maturity 
therefore  the following table should not be used as a forecast of future cash flows 
within one year one to three years three to five years over five years demand deposits savings money market and sweep certificates of deposit total certificates of deposit in amounts of  or more  and their remaining maturities at december   are as follows three months or less over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months total the market in which the company operates is very competitive and the rates of interest paid on deposits are affected by rates paid by other depository institutions 
management closely monitors rates offered by other institutions and seeks to be competitive within the market 
the company has chosen to selectively compete for large certificates of deposits 
the company will choose to pursue such deposits when expected loan growth provides for adequate spreads to support the cost of those funds 
as of december   the company had outstanding certificates of deposit of approximately million that were either obtained through the listing of certificate of deposit rates on two internet based listing services such deposits are sometimes referred to herein as national market certificates of deposit or acquired through promontory financial network s certificate of deposit account registry service cdars program 
the national market certificates of deposit were issued with an average yield of and an average term of months 
included in the million are national market certificates of deposit totaling  that have been classified as brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes 
these brokered deposits were issued with an average yield of and an average term of months 
as of december   the total certificates of deposit obtained through the listing of certificate of deposit rates on the internet based listing services were approximately million  and included million of brokered deposits 
the company has never paid broker fees for deposits 
in the first quarter of  the company began using brokered certificates of deposit through promontory financial network 
through this deposit matching network and its cdars program  the company has the ability to offer its customers access to fdic insured deposit products in aggregate amounts exceeding current insurance limits 
when the company places funds through cdars on behalf of a customer  it receives matching deposits through the network 
the company also has the ability to raise deposits directly through the network 
these deposits are also considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes 
as of december   the company had approximately million of cdars deposits outstanding of which  was placed on behalf of customers and million was raised by the company 
these deposits were issued with an average yield of and an average term of month 
below is a reconciliation of total deposits to core deposits as of december  and  respectively december  december  total deposits national market certificates of deposit variable balance accounts customer in and portion of variable balance accounts considered to be core core deposits core deposits  which management categorizes as all deposits other than national market certificates of deposit  cdars deposits and million of the million deposits from the large customer described above  stood at million as of december   down from million as of december  overall  the company did not aggressively compete for new deposits during as adequate liquidity was available to fund loan growth  which primarily accounts for the decrease in core deposits over in addition  the company experienced a decline in money market and sweep accounts as customers shifted to its newly created overnight commercial paper program  which is classified as short term borrowings 
core deposits are closely monitored by management because they consider such deposits not only a relatively stable source of funding but also reflective of the growth of commercial and consumer depository relationships 
borrowings 
short term borrowings as of december  included repurchase agreements collateralized by pledges of us government treasury securities  based upon their market values  equal to of the principal and accrued interest of the repurchase agreements 
the outstanding balance of repurchase agreements decreased from  at december  to no borrowings at december   due to one customer s decision to invest available overnight funds in the bank s newly created overnight commercial paper program 
this decision is advantageous for the bank because it eliminates the bank s need to tie up securities as collateral for deposits 
included in short term borrowings as of december  is million of borrowings under the previously mentioned overnight commercial paper program and million borrowed under federal funds lines of credit 
these borrowings are unsecured and are subordinated to all deposits 
in addition  the company borrowed million under its secured federal home loan bank credit facility 
short term borrowings as of december  included million borrowed under commercial paper 
subordinated debt consists of million of fixed interest rate trust preferred securities the trust preferred securities  issued on december  through a delaware trust subsidiary  bay national capital trust i the trust

the company purchased the common securities from the trust for  in accordance with provisions of fin  the financial position and results of operations are not included in the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the trust used the proceeds of the sale of the trust preferred securities and common securities to purchase from the company the aggregate principal amount of  of the company s fixed rate junior subordinated debt securities due the debt securities 
like the trust preferred securities  the debt securities bear interest at the fixed annual rate of until maturity 
the interest expense on trust preferred securities  which include amortization of issuance costs  was   and  in  and  respectively 
the debt securities mature on february   but may be redeemed at the company s option at any time on any february  may  august or november on or after february   or at any time upon certain events  such as a change in the regulatory capital treatment of debt securities  the trust being deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended  or the occurrence of certain adverse tax events 
except upon the occurrence of the events described above  which require a redemption premium for redemptions prior to february   the company may redeem the debt securities at their aggregate principal amount  plus accrued interest  if any 
the parent is required to retain  of the proceeds from the debt securities for general corporate purposes which may include making interest payments on the debt securities until the earlier of i the date on which the retained funds are reduced to zero  or ii the date on which the bank or any successor meets the statutory requirements to pay dividends of at least  for each of two consecutive quarters with positive retained earnings remaining after any such dividend payment 
as of december   the bank met the retained earnings requirement 
the debt securities are subordinated to the prior payment of other indebtedness of the company that  by its terms  is not similarly subordinated 
although the debt securities are recorded as a liability on the company s balance sheet  the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital  subject to regulatory guidelines that limit the amount included to an aggregate of of tier capital 
as of december   the company had unused commitments for a total of million of borrowing availability under unsecured federal funds lines of credit with three separate financial institutions 
the company also had approximately million of borrowing capacity with the federal home loan bank of atlanta as of december  for additional information with respect to borrowings  please see note to the company s audited financial statements  borrowings 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of asset liability management is to ensure the steady growth of the company s primary earnings component  net interest income 
net interest income can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
to minimize the risk associated with these rate swings  management works to structure the company s balance sheet so that the ability exists to adjust pricing on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in roughly equivalent amounts at approximately the same time intervals 
imbalances in these repricing opportunities at any point in time constitute interest rate sensitivity 
the measurement of the company s interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the principal techniques used in asset liability management 
the interest sensitive gap is the dollar difference between assets and liabilities which are subject to interest rate pricing within a given time period  including both floating rate or adjustable rate instruments  and instruments which are approaching maturity 
the following table sets forth the amount of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   which are expected to mature or reprice in each of the time periods shown maturity or repricing within amount percent of total to months to months to years over years interest earning assets federal funds sold and other overnight investments loans held for sale investment securities available for sale loans variable rate loans fixed rate other earning assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities deposits variable rate deposits fixed rate short term borrowings variable rate subordinated debt total interest bearing liabilities periodic repricing differences periodic gap cumulative gap ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities the company has of its interest earning assets and of its interest bearing liabilities in variable rate balances 
the excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities of million in the categories of items maturing or repricing within years comprises the majority of the overall gap 
this gap is generally reflective of the company s emphasis on investing in short term investments and originating variable rate loans and the demand in the market for higher yielding fixed rate deposits 
this analysis indicates that the company generally will benefit from rising market rates of interest 
however  since all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same pace  the gap is only a general indicator of interest rate sensitivity 
the analysis of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities presents only a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration the fact that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
net interest income may be affected by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management constantly monitors and manages the structure of the company s balance sheet  seeks to control interest rate exposure and evaluate pricing strategies 
strategies to better match maturities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities include structuring loans with rate floors and ceilings on variable rate notes and by providing for repricing opportunities on fixed rate notes 
management believes that a lending strategy focusing on variable rate loans and short term fixed rate loans will best facilitate the goal of minimizing interest rate risk 
however  management will opportunistically enter into longer term fixed rate loans and or investments when  in management s judgment  rates adequately compensate the company for the interest rate risk 
the company s current investment concentration in federal funds sold and other overnight investments provides the most flexibility and control over rate sensitivity since it generally can be restructured more quickly than the loan portfolio 
on the liability side  deposit products can be restructured so as to offer incentives to attain the maturity distribution desired  although  competitive factors sometimes make control over deposit maturity difficult 
in theory  maintaining a nominal level of interest rate sensitivity can diminish interest rate risk 
in practice  this is made difficult by a number of factors  including cyclical variation in loan demand  different impacts on interest sensitive assets and liabilities when interest rates change and the availability of funding sources 
management generally attempts to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities as the exposure period is lengthened to minimize the overall interest rate risk to the company 
liquidity the company s overall asset liability strategy takes into account the need to maintain adequate liquidity to fund asset growth and deposit runoff 
management monitors the liquidity position daily 
the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  short term borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements  commercial paper  borrowings under the federal funds and federal home loan bank credit facilities  scheduled amortization and prepayment of loans  funds provided by operations and capital 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions  and rates offered by our competition 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and assets that can be readily converted into cash  including investment securities maturing within one year 
as of december   the company had million in cash and due from banks  million in federal funds sold and other overnight investments and  in three month us treasury securities 
as of december   the company had million in cash and due from banks  million in federal funds sold and other overnight investments and  in three month us treasury securities 
the decrease in the overall level of liquid assets  other than loans expected to be sold within days  is the result of management s decision to maintain margins by using available liquidity to fund loan growth and allow non core time deposits to mature 
as of december   the company had unused commitments for a total of million of borrowing availability under unsecured federal funds lines of credit with three separate financial institutions 
the company also has approximately million of borrowing capacity with the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
these credit facilities can be used in conjunction with the normal deposit strategies  which include pricing changes to increase deposits as necessary 
from time to time  the company may sell or participate out loans to create additional liquidity as required 
the company has sufficient liquidity to meet its loan commitments as well as fluctuations in deposits 
the company will seek to retain maturing certificates of deposit  when necessary  by offering competitive rates 
management is not aware of any known trends  events or uncertainties that will have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity  capital or operations  nor are we aware of any current recommendation by regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have a material effect on liquidity  capital or operations 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business 
these financial instruments primarily include commitments to extend credit  lines of credit and standby letters of credit 
the company uses these financial instruments to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
in addition  the company also has operating lease obligations and purchase commitments 
outstanding loan commitments and lines and letters of credit at december  and are as follows loan commitments unused lines of credit letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts  fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
unused lines of credit represent the unused portion of lines of credit previously extended and available to the customer as long as there is no violation of any contractual condition 
these lines generally have variable interest rates 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  and since it is unlikely that customers will draw upon their line of credit in full at any time  the total commitment amount or line of credit amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company is not aware of any loss it would incur by funding its commitments or lines of credit 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contract amount of the commitment 
in general  loan commitments  lines of credit and letters of credit are made on the same terms  including with respect to collateral  as outstanding loans 
each customer s credit worthiness and the collateral required are evaluated on a case by case basis

the company has declared no cash dividends since its inception 
banking regulatory authorities have implemented strict capital guidelines directly related to the credit risk associated with an institution s assets 
banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain capital levels based on their risk adjusted assets so that categories of assets with higher defined credit risks will require more capital support than assets with lower risks 
the bank has exceeded its capital adequacy requirements to date 
banking regulations also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the bank s regulatory agencies 
regulatory approval is required to pay dividends that exceed the bank s net profits for the current year plus its retained net profits for the preceding two years 
the bank could have paid dividends to the company without approval from bank regulatory agencies at december   however  such payments are not currently planned

the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established or when an asset or liability must be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting policy that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and  as such  could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s best estimate of losses known and inherent in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate  based on  among other factors prior loss experience of the company and peer institutions  current economic conditions  review of the ongoing financial conditions of borrowers  and the views of the company s regulators and the firm that conducts an annual independent loan review 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company uses a loan grading system where loans are graded based on management s evaluation of the risk associated with each loan 
a factor  based on the loan grading  is applied to the loan balance to reserve for losses 
in addition  management judgmentally establishes an additional nonspecific reserve 
the nonspecific portion of the allowance reflects management s estimate of probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
management has significant discretion in making the judgments inherent in the determination of the provision and allowance for credit losses  including the valuation of collateral and the assessment of the financial condition of the borrower  and in establishing allowance percentages and risk ratings 
the establishment of allowance factors is a continuing exercise and allowance factors may change over time  resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount of the provision or allowance based upon the same volume and classification of loans 
changes in allowance factors or in management s interpretation of those factors will have a direct impact on the amount of the provision and a corresponding effect on income and assets 
also  errors in management s perception and assessment of the allowance factors could result in the allowance not being adequate to cover losses in the portfolio and may result in additional provisions or charge offs  which would adversely affect income and capital

recent accounting pronouncements and developments note to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting policies adopted by the company during and the expected impact of accounting policies  recently issued or proposed  but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section s of this financial review and notes to the consolidated financial statements
