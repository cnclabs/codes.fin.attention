item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
the following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information  including our financial statements and the notes thereto  which appears elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading us steel service center with over years of experience 
our primary focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon  coated and stainless flat rolled sheet  coil and plate products 
we operate as an intermediary between steel producers and manufacturers that require processed steel for their operations 
we serve customers in most carbon steel consuming industries  including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment  construction and farm machinery  storage tanks  environmental and energy generation  automobiles  food service and electrical equipment  military vehicles and equipment  as well as general and plate fabricators and steel service centers 
we distribute our products primarily through a direct sales force 
we operate as a single business segment with strategically located processing and distribution facilities in connecticut  georgia  illinois  iowa  michigan  minnesota  north carolina  ohio and pennsylvania 
this geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi national accounts  primarily located throughout the midwestern  eastern and southern united states 
we sell a broad range of steel products  many of which have different gross profits and margins 
products that have more value added processing generally have a greater gross profit and higher margins 
accordingly  our overall gross profit is affected by  among other things  product mix  the amount of processing performed  the availability of steel  volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs 
we also perform toll processing of customer owned steel  the majority of which is performed by our michigan and georgia operations 
we sell certain products internationally  primarily in puerto rico and mexico 
all international sales and payments are made in united states dollars 
recent international sales have been immaterial to our consolidated financial results 
our results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including  but not limited to  general and global business  economic and political conditions  competition  steel pricing and availability  energy prices  pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of steel  inventory held in the supply chain  customer demand for steel and customers ability to manage their credit line availability and layoffs or work stoppages by our own  our suppliers or our customers personnel 
the steel industry also continues to be affected by the global consolidation of our suppliers  competitors and end use customers 
on may   we acquired the remaining interest in gsp 
prior to may  our interest in gsp was accounted for under the equity method 
since may  the results of gsp have been fully consolidated into our financial statements 
we subsequently sold the remaining assets of gsp in december and gsp ceased operations 
in january  we announced plans to close the olp joint venture in detroit  michigan 
olp  which was a processor of laser welded steel blanks for the automotive industry  ceased operations in the first quarter of our interest in olp is accounted for under the equity method 
in june  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of ps w  a north carolina based fabricator of heavy construction equipment components 
since june  the results of ps w have been fully consolidated into our financial statements 
at december   we employed approximately  people  of which approximately of the hourly plant personnel at our minneapolis and detroit facilities are represented by four separate collective bargaining units 
a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately five detroit maintenance workers expired on july  employees covered under this agreement continue to operate as a new agreement is negotiated 
while we expect to be able to negotiate a new agreement  there can be no assurances that such resolution will occur 

table of contents collective bargaining agreements covering minneapolis and other detroit employees expire in and subsequent years 
we have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that our relationship with employees is good 
however  any prolonged work stoppages by our personnel represented by collective bargaining units could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates  under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we monitor and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
estimations are based upon the application of an historical collection rate to the outstanding accounts receivable balance  which remains fairly level from year to year  and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers  which can fluctuate significantly from year to year 
we cannot be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience 
we consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the costs of the purchased steel  internal and external processing  and inbound freight 
cost is determined using the specific identification method 
we regularly review our inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventory 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
we record an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed 
income taxes deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet include  as an offset to the estimated temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated balance sheets  the tax effect of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
if we determine that we will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset  we will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its net realizable value 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
for both direct and toll shipments  revenue is recognized when steel is shipped to the customer and title and risk of loss is transferred which generally occurs upon delivery to our customers 
given the proximity of our customers to our facilities  substantially all of our sales are shipped and received within one day 
sales returns and allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates and are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for the years ended december   and dollars shown in thousands of net of net of net sales sales sales net sales gross profit a operating expenses b operating income a gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold  exclusive of depreciation 
b operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold 
compared to tons sold in decreased to million tons from million tons last year 
tons sold in included million tons from direct sales and thousand tons from toll processing  compared with million direct tons and thousand toll tons in net sales in increased to billion from million 
average selling prices for increased from we expect average selling prices to increase during the first quarter of  as steel pricing in the first quarter of has increased substantially over steel pricing in the fourth quarter of  and we attempt to pass through price increases from steel producers to our customers 
in  gross profit exclusive of depreciation  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to from in higher inventory levels at steel service centers at the beginning of led to competitive pressures and lower sales prices and gross margins throughout most of the year 
as we enter  inventory levels at service centers are relatively low 
steel producers began increasing prices during the fourth quarter of and announced significant price increases during the first quarter of we believe that steel supply will be constrained during the first half of due to domestic production constraints and the lack of available imported steel 
accordingly  we expect that competitive pressures to obtain steel will result in higher selling prices and gross margin levels during the first quarter of  as compared to the fourth quarter of as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses for increased to from in operating expenses for increased to million from million in the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of ps w s operating expenses in and a full year of costs associated with the development of our new information system which began during the third quarter of 
financing costs for increased to million from million in our effective borrowing rate  inclusive of deferred financing fees  was in  compared to in in  we reported income before income taxes of million  compared to million in an income tax provision of was recorded during  compared to in taxes paid in totaled million  compared to million in we expect our effective tax rate in to approximate 

table of contents net income for totaled million or per diluted share  compared to million or per diluted share in compared to tons sold in decreased to million tons from million tons in tons sold in included million tons from direct sales and thousand tons from toll processing  compared with million direct tons and thousand toll tons in net sales in increased to million from million 
average selling prices for increased from in  gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  increased to from in as the base price of steel declined during the first nine months of  competitive pressures resulted in lower selling prices and gross margin 
gross margin levels began increasing during the end of the third quarter of and we experienced higher average selling prices and higher gross margins through the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  higher inventory levels at steel service centers led to competitive pressures  declining sales prices and lower gross margins 
as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses for increased to from in operating expenses for increased to million from million in the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher distribution costs caused by higher fuel costs and surcharges  the addition of our second facility in chambersburg  pennsylvania  the increased number of laser processing machines in operation  increased variable compensation expense  expenses associated with the implementation of our new information system  and the inclusion of operating expenses related to the consolidation of gsp starting on may and the acquisition of ps w starting on june 
in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r which requires us to record compensation expense for stock options issued to employees and directors 
prior to  we accounted for stock options granted to employees and directors under the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 where no compensation expense was recognized 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method where compensation expense is recorded prospectively 
the adoption of sfas no 
r resulted in thousand of expense being recorded for stock options during  compared to no stock option expense being recognized during in  losses from joint ventures totaled thousand compared with thousand in olp ceased operations during the first quarter of operating losses generated by olp during the first quarter of were recorded against the million reserve for loss on disposition of joint ventures that was recorded at december  during the second and third quarters of  olp began liquidating its remaining assets 
offers from third parties to purchase the remaining assets were less than anticipated and we recorded an additional million charge in the second quarter of financing costs for decreased to million from million in due to lower borrowing levels in our effective borrowing rate  inclusive of deferred financing fees  was in compared to in in  we reported income before income taxes of million  compared to million in an income tax provision of was recorded during  compared to in taxes paid in totaled million  compared to million in net income for totaled million or per diluted share  compared to million or per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs  purchasing and upgrading of processing equipment and facilities  making acquisitions and paying dividends 
we use cash generated from operations  leasing transactions and borrowings under our credit facility to fund these requirements 

table of contents working capital at december  decreased million from the end of the prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in inventories  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in prepaids and others and a million increase in cash 
during  we generated million of net cash from operations  of which million was derived from cash earnings and million was generated from working capital 
in  we spent million on capital expenditures 
we completed a million project to equip and expand our iowa facility by approximately  square feet in order to meet our customers needs for high quality sheet product 
we have also installed additional laser and plasma cutting equipment and machining centers in cleveland  chicago  chambersburg and ps w to support our growing value added services 
due to the risk of technological obsolescence  it has been our policy to lease new laser cutting equipment 
in  we ordered a million stretcher leveler cut to length line for our minneapolis coil facility  which is expected to become operational in the second quarter of we are also in the process of implementing a new single information system to replace the four systems we currently use 
the objective is to standardize and streamline business processes and improve support for our growing service center and fabrication business 
the project will require a significant deployment of capital and will require a significant use of management s time 
the total external costs associated with the new information system are expected to approximate million over a phased implementation that began in july we expect capital spending to approximate million in to further our value added strategies in both existing and new facilities 
during  our board of directors approved quarterly dividends of 
per share that were paid on march  and june  the board of directors then increased the quarterly dividend to 
per share  which were paid on september  and december  in february  our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 
per share  which is payable on march  to shareholders of record as of march  we expect to make regular dividend distributions in the future  subject to the availability of cash and continuing determination by our board of directors that the payment of dividends remains in the best interest of our shareholders 
our secured bank financing agreement is a revolving credit facility collateralized by our accounts receivable  inventories and substantially all of our property and equipment 
borrowings are limited to the lesser of a borrowing base  comprised of eligible accounts receivable and inventories or  effective with a july amendment  million in the aggregate 
the maturity date of the credit facility is december   with annual extensions at the banks option 
in december  we advanced million to olp to cover a loan guarantee obligation 
we believe the underlying value of olp s remaining assets  upon liquidation  will be sufficient to repay the advance at a later date 
the credit facility requires us to comply with various covenants  the most significant of which include i minimum availability of million  tested monthly  ii a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  and a maximum leverage ratio of  which are tested quarterly  iii restrictions on additional indebtedness  and iv limitations on capital expenditures and investments 
at december   we had approximately million of availability and were in compliance with our covenants under the credit facility 
the credit facility also contains an accordion feature that allows us to add up to million of additional revolver capacity in certain circumstances 
substantially higher steel prices in the first quarter of will result in increased working capital levels 
we believe that funds available under our credit facility and lease arrangements  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements over at least the next months 
in the future  we may as part of our business strategy  acquire and dispose of other assets in the same or complementary lines of business  or enter into or exit strategic alliances and joint ventures 
accordingly  the timing and size of our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations less than more than amounts in thousands total year years years years long term debt obligations including interest unrecognized tax positions other long term liabilities operating leases total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has a made guarantees  b a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  c any obligation under certain derivative instruments  or d any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to a company  or engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development services within a company 
as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements 
effects of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased steel  energy and borrowings under our credit facility 
general inflation has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years  however  we have experienced increased distribution expense as a result of higher fuel costs

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk during the past several years  the base price of carbon flat rolled steel has fluctuated significantly 
declining prices could reduce our gross profit margin percentages to levels that are lower than our historical levels 
higher inventory levels held by us  other steel service centers or end use customers could cause competitive pressures that could also reduce gross margins 
higher raw material costs for steel producers could cause the price of steel to increase 
while we have generally been successful in the past in passing producers price increases and surcharges to our customers  there is no guarantee that we will be able to pass price increases to our customers in the future 
approximately of our net sales in were directly to automotive customers 
the automotive industry experiences significant fluctuations in demand based on numerous factors such as general economic conditions and consumer confidence 
the automotive industry is also subject  from time to time  to labor work stoppages 
the domestic automotive industry  which has experienced a number of bankruptcies  is currently involved in significant restructuring which has resulted in lower production volumes 
certain customers in this industry represent an increasing credit risk 
inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased steel  energy  and borrowings under our credit facility 
general inflation has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years  however  we have experienced increased distribution expenses as a result of higher fuel costs 
when raw material prices increase  competitive conditions will influence how much of the steel price increase can be passed on to our customers 
when raw material prices decline  customer demands for lower cost product result in lower selling prices 
declining steel prices have generally adversely affected our net sales and net income while increasing steel prices have favorably affected our net sales and net income 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuating steel prices 
we have not entered into any interest rate or steel commodity hedge transactions for speculative purposes or otherwise 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from variable rate debt 
if interest rates in the future were to increase basis points from december  rates and  assuming no change in total debt from december  levels  the additional annual interest expense to us would be approximately thousand 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to variable interest rate risk 
however  we have the option to enter into to day fixed base rate euro loans under our credit facility
