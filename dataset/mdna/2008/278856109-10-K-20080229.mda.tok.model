executive overview about the company eclipsys is a leading provider of advanced integrated clinical  revenue cycle and access management software  and professional services that help healthcare organizations improve their clinical  financial  operational and patient satisfaction outcomes 
we develop and license proprietary software and content that is designed for use in connection with many of the key clinical  financial and operational functions that healthcare organizations require 
among other things  our software enables physicians  nurses and other clinicians to coordinate care through a shared electronic medical record  place orders and access and share information about patients 
our software helps clients optimize the healthcare revenue cycle  including patient admissions  scheduling  invoicing  inventory control and cost accounting  in addition to providing records maintenance and assessment of the profitability of specific medical procedures and personnel 
clinical content  which is integrated with our software  provides evidence based practice guidelines for use by physicians  nurses and other clinicians 
we also provide professional services related to our software 
these services include software implementation  outsourcing  remote hosting of our software as well as third party healthcare information technology applications  technical and user training and consulting 
our income statement items of revenue are as follows systems and services revenue includes revenue derived from a variety of sources  including software licenses and contractual software maintenance under which fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  and professional services 
our systems and services revenue includes both subscription software license revenue which is recognized ratably over a contractual term and license revenue related to traditional software contracts which is generally recognized upon delivery of the software and represents less than of total revenues 
for some clients  we host the software applications licensed from us remotely on our own servers  which saves such clients the cost of procuring and maintaining hardware and related facilities 
for other clients  we offer an outsourced solution in which we assume partial to total responsibility for a healthcare organization s information technology operations using our employees 
margins on the license and maintenance revenue are generally significantly higher than those on the professional services revenues 
hardware revenue results from our sale of computer hardware to our clients in connection with their implementation of our software 
we purchase this hardware from suppliers and resell it to our clients 
as clients opt for remote hosted solutions  clients need for hardware is reduced and future hardware revenues may be negatively impacted 
the amount of hardware revenues  and the proportion of our total revenues that they represent  can vary significantly from period to period 
margins on hardware revenues are generally significantly lower than those on systems and services revenues 
we market our software to healthcare providers of many different sizes and specialties  including community hospitals  large multi entity healthcare systems  academic medical centers  outpatient clinics and physician practices 
most of the top ranked us hospitals named in us news world report s honor roll use one or more of our solutions 
we commenced operations in india in through an acquisition of a small producer of laboratory software 
by december  our india operations  now named eclipsys india private limited  have expanded to include two offices and over employees 
we believe that india provides base access to educated professionals to work on research development and support of our software  at an economically effective cost 
in october  as a result of our efforts to grow internationally  singhealth  the largest healthcare provider in singapore  selected eclipsys sunrise clinical manager as its electronic medical record platform 
in the third quarter of  as part of the ongoing refinement of our business mix  we decided to exit our networking services business 
the exit of the business was completed in the fourth quarter of in december  we sold our clinical practice model resource center cpmrc business to elsevier  a world leading publisher of scientific  technical and health information products and services 
the decision to exit our networking services business as well as the sale of cpmrc will result in an aggregate reduction of approximately million to the company s base business revenue stream in when compared to we expect to more than offset this loss of revenue with growth in other areas of the business 
business environment the healthcare information technology industry in which eclipsys conducts its business is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations and industry standards 
sales of eclipsys solutions can be affected significantly by many competitive factors  including the features and cost of such solutions  our marketing effectiveness  and the research and development of new solutions 
it is anticipated that the healthcare information technology industry will grow and be seen as a way to curb growing healthcare costs while also improving the quality of healthcare 
strategy our strategy for revenue growth is to increase recurring revenue streams  continue to win new clients both domestically and in international markets  expand product footprint at existing clients  continue to broaden our solution portfolio  and take advantage of market opportunities to replace outdated revenue cycle management solutions 
outloook the company currently expects annual revenues to range from million to million 
excluding stock based compensation expense  costs associated with our derivative litigation  and costs associated with corporate relocation  non gaap earnings per share on a diluted basis are expected to range from to 
new accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies we believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance as these policies affect the reported amount of revenues and expenses and other significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates and adjusts its estimates and judgments  if necessary 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be materially different from those estimates 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software development costs  stock based compensation and income taxes 
please refer to note of the audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenues are derived from licensing of computer software  software and hardware maintenance  professional services including implementation  integration  training and consulting  remote hosting  outsourcing  network services  and the sale of computer hardware 
we generally contract under multiple element arrangements  which include software license fees  hardware and services  including implementation  integration  training and software maintenance  for periods of to years 
we evaluate revenue recognition on a contract by contract basis as the terms of each arrangement vary 
the evaluation of our contractual arrangements often requires judgments and estimates that affect the timing of revenue recognized in our statements of operations 
specifically  we may be required to make judgments about whether the fees associated with our software and services are fixed or determinable  whether collection of our fees is considered probable  whether professional services are essential to the functionality of the related software  whether we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage of completion method  and whether we have verifiable objective evidence of fair value for our software and services 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
sop and sab  as amended  require among other matters  that there be a signed contract evidencing an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
many of our contracts with our clients are multiple element arrangements which may provide for multiple software modules including the rights to unspecified future versions and releases we may offer within the software suites the client purchases or rights to unspecified software versions that support different hardware or operating platforms  and that do not qualify as exchange rights 
we refer to these arrangements as subscription contracts 
additionally  we sometimes enter into multiple element arrangements that do not include these rights to unspecified future software or platform protection rights 
we refer to these arrangements as traditional software contracts 
finally  we offer much of our software and services on a stand alone basis 
revenue under each of these arrangements is recognized as set forth below subscription contracts our subscription contracts typically include the following deliverables software license fees  maintenance  professional services  and third party hardware or remote hosting services 
software license fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  commencing upon the delivery of the software provided that there is evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of our fee is considered probable 
the value of the software is determined using the residual method pursuant to sop modification of sop  with respect to certain transactions 
these contracts contain the rights to unspecified future software within the suite purchased and or unspecified platform transfer rights that do not qualify for exchange accounting 
accordingly  these arrangements are accounted for pursuant to paragraphs and of sop software revenue recognition 
under certain arrangements  we capitalize related direct costs consisting of third party software costs and direct software implementation costs 
these costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement 
in the case of maintenance revenues  vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value is based on substantive renewal prices  and the revenues are recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
in the case of professional services revenues  vsoe is based on prices from stand alone sale transactions  and the revenues are recognized as services are performed pursuant to paragraph of sop third party hardware revenues are recognized upon delivery  pursuant to sab for remote hosting services  vsoe is based upon consistent pricing charged to clients based on volumes and performance requirements on a stand alone basis and substantive renewal terms  and the revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term as the services are performed 
our remote hosting arrangements generally require us to perform one time set up activities and include a one time set up fee 
this one time set up fee is generally paid by the client at contract execution 
we have determined that these set up activities do not constitute a separate unit of accounting  and accordingly the related set up fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
we consider the applicability of eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  to our remote hosting services arrangements on a contract by contract basis 
if we determine that the client has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty  and can feasibly run the software on its own hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software  a software element covered by sop exists 
when a software element exists in a remote hosting services arrangement  we recognize the license  professional services and remote hosting services revenues pursuant to sop  whereby the fair value of the remote hosting service is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the remote hosting contract 
if we determine that a software element covered by sop is not present in a remote hosting services arrangement  we recognize revenue for the remote hosting services arrangement  ratably over the term of the remote hosting contract pursuant to sab traditional software contracts we enter into traditional multiple element arrangements that include the following elements software license  maintenance  professional services  and third party hardware or remote hosting services 
revenue for each of the elements is recognized as follows software license fees are recognized upon delivery of the software provided that there is evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of our fee is considered probable 
for those arrangements in which the fee is not considered fixed or determinable  the software license revenue is recognized as the payments become due 
for arrangements where vsoe only exists for the undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements software license revenue using the residual method in accordance with sop in addition to the software license fees  these contracts may also contain maintenance  professional services and hardware or remote hosting services 
vsoe and revenue recognition for these elements is determined using the same methodology as noted above for subscription contracts 
software contracts requiring contract accounting we enter into certain multiple element arrangements containing milestone provisions in which the professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the software 
under these arrangements  software license fees and professional service revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method over the implementation period which generally ranges from to months 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the implementation based upon estimates of total labor hours incurred and revenues to be generated over the term of the implementation 
changes in estimates of total labor hours and the related effect on the timing of revenues and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
accordingly  changes in these estimates could occur and have a material effect on our operating results in the period of change 
stand alone software and service we also market certain software and services on a stand alone basis  including the following software license  maintenance  professional services  hardware  outsourcing  and remote hosting services 
revenues related to such software and services are recognized as follows software license fees and maintenance marketed on a stand alone basis may be licensed either under traditional contracts or under subscription arrangements 
software license fees under traditional contracts are recognized pursuant to sop upon delivery of the software  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
under subscription agreements for stand alone software  license fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
with respect to maintenance  vsoe is determined based on substantive renewal prices contained in the contracts 
maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
professional services represent incremental services marketed to clients including implementation and consulting services 
professional services revenues  where vsoe is based on prices from stand alone transactions  are recognized as services are performed 
hardware is recognized upon delivery pursuant to sab network service arrangements include the assessment  assembly and delivery of a wireless network which may include wireless carts or other wireless equipment to the client 
our network services arrangements are sold to a client for a fixed fee 
all services are performed prior to the delivery of the equipment 
these contracts are typically to days in length and are recognized pursuant to sab  upon the delivery of the network to the client 
remote hosting contracts that are sold on a stand alone basis are recognized ratably over the contract term pursuant to sab our remote hosting arrangements generally require us to perform one time set up activities and include a one time set up fee 
this one time set up fee is generally paid by the client at contract execution 
we have determined that these set up activities do not constitute a separate unit of accounting  and accordingly  recognize the related set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
we provide outsourcing services to our clients 
under these arrangements we assume full  partial or transitional responsibilities for a healthcare organization s it operations using our employees 
our outsourcing services include facilities management  network outsourcing and transition management 
these arrangements typically range from five to ten years in duration 
revenues from these arrangements are recognized when services are performed 
we record reimbursable out of pocket expenses in both systems and services revenues and as a direct cost of systems and services in accordance with eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
for   and reimbursable out of pocket expenses were million  million  and million  respectively 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees  we have classified the reimbursement by clients of shipping and handling costs as revenue and the associated cost as cost of revenue 
if other judgments or assumptions were used in the evaluation of our revenue arrangements  the timing and amounts of revenue recognized may have been significantly different 
allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors  including a specific client s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  as well as general factors such as the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record a reserve for specific account balances as well as a reserve based on our historical experience for bad debt to reduce the related receivables to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from clients 
if circumstances related to specific clients change  or economic conditions deteriorate such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant  our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize a portion of our computer software development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
these costs include salaries  benefits  consulting and other directly related costs incurred in connection with programming and testing software 
capitalization ceases when the software is generally released for sale to clients 
management monitors the net realizable value of development costs to ensure that the investment will be recovered through future revenues 
capitalized software development costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these costs are amortized over the greater of the ratio that current revenues are to total and anticipated future revenues for the applicable software or the straight line method over three years 
amortization of capitalized software development costs  which is included in cost of systems and services  was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
accumulated amortization of capitalized software development costs was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas r share based payment  as adopted effective january  prior to january   we accounted for our stock based employee compensation arrangements under the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion accounting for stock issued to employees  as allowed by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
as a result  no expense was recognized for options to purchase our common stock that were granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value at the date of grant and no expense was recognized in connection with purchases under our employee stock purchase plan prior to january  we elected to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized during the year ended december   includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas amortized over the awards vesting period  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r amortized on a straight line basis over the awards vesting period 
the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions for the activity under our stock plans 
option pricing model input assumptions such as expected term  expected volatility  and risk free interest rate  impact the fair value estimate 
further  the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions were based on or determined from external data for example  the risk free interest rate and other assumptions were derived from our historical experience for example volatility 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment  based on relevant facts and circumstances 
pro forma results for prior periods have not been restated 
we have elected to use the simplified method for estimating our expected term equal to the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term as allowed by sab  share based payment 
we currently estimate volatility by using the weighted average historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term input to the black scholes model 
we estimate forfeitures using a weighted average historical forfeiture rate 
our estimate of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from our estimate 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
a change in these estimates could have a material effect on our operating results 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our total net deferred tax asset related to our us and indian operations 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we include an expense or a benefit within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we are required to reverse the valuation allowance and record a benefit for the net deferred tax asset if and to the extent that we conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize the asset 
this will result in a non recurring benefit in the period that we make the determination 
in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in canada will be recovered from taxable income 
accordingly  in  we recorded a tax benefit related to reversing a tax valuation allowance associated with our canadian operation 
as of december   a valuation allowance of approximately million has been established against the us deferred tax assets that management does not believe are more likely than not to be realized 
this determination is based primarily on the company s recent history of taxable losses  operating losses and uncertainty with respect to its forecasted results 
we will continue to assess the requirement for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
should the company achieve its forecasted results  we may determine from our valuation allowance assessment that the positive evidence outweighs the negative resulting in the release of all or a portion of the allowance 
as of december   we had us net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
of this amount  million expires in and million expires in  the balance expires in varying amounts through of the total us net operating loss carryforward  approximately million relates to stock option tax deductions which will be tax effected and the benefit credited as additional paid in capital when realized

revenues recognized ratably from software  maintenance  outsourcing and remote hosting were million  an increase of million or  when compared to the increase was due to higher sales bookings in previous periods of our software  outsourcing and remote hosting related services resulting in the growth in our recurring revenue base 
professional services revenues 
professional services revenues  which include implementation and consulting related services  were million  which represented an increase of million or over the prior year 
the increase resulted from additional client implementation activity and an improvement in utilization of our professional services staff 
periodic revenues 
periodic revenues related to software related fees  third party software related fees and networking services were million  which represented an increase of million or over the prior year 
the table below summarizes the components of periodic revenues for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december  change change eclipsys software related fees third party software related fees networking services total periodic revenues the increase in periodic revenues in compared to was primarily attributable to increased software related fees 
in any period  these revenues can be considered one time in nature for that period  and we do not recognize this revenue on a ratable basis 
this revenue includes periodic traditional license fees associated with new contracts signed in the period  including add on licenses to existing clients and new client transactions  as well as revenue from contract backlog that had not previously been recognized pending contract performance that occurred or was completed during the period  and certain other activities during the period associated with existing client relationships 
in the aggregate  these periodic revenues can contribute significantly to earnings in the period given there are relatively little in period costs associated with such revenues other than those costs associated with networking services 
we expect these periodic revenues to continue to fluctuate on a yearly basis as a result of significant variations in the type and magnitude of sales and other contract and client activity in any period  and these variations make it difficult to predict the nature and amount of these periodic revenues 
the increase in software related fees in was partially offset by lower revenues from networking services due to management s decision in the third quarter of to stop selling networking products 
the decision to exit our networking services business as well as the sale of cpmrc will result in an aggregate reduction of approximately million to the company s base business revenue stream in when compared to we expect to more than offset this loss of revenue with growth in other areas of the business 
hardware revenues hardware revenues decreased by million during to million 
the decrease in revenues resulted from more clients choosing other hardware sources and or reducing their hardware needs by opting for remote hosted solutions 
as remote hosting reduces clients need for hardware  future hardware revenues may be negatively impacted 
we expect hardware revenues to continue to fluctuate on an annual basis 
operating expenses cost of systems and services increased by million  or  to million  for the year ended december  the increase in cost of systems and services in was primarily attributable to the following higher labor related costs of million  mainly associated with an increase in headcount and higher incentive compensation on improved financial performance  higher travel costs of million associated with increased level of sales activity  and higher consulting  software maintenance and software license costs associated with incremental implementation and software related revenues 
the increases above were slightly offset by lower amortization of capitalized software development costs of million  as costs capitalized for sunrise clinical manager xa were fully amortized as of the second quarter of cost of hardware decreased million  or  in the decrease in these costs was directly related to the lower hardware volumes discussed above  slightly offset by more favorable product margins 
the gross margin percentage on hardware revenue increased to in compared to in impacted by changes in product mix 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to increased labor related costs of million on higher headcount  higher commissions on increased sales volumes and increased incentive compensation on improved financial performance 
the increase was also related to additional expenses for tradeshows and marketing events designed to enhance market awareness of the company s solutions 
research and development expenses were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million over the prior year 
research and development expense decreased due to the higher level of internal labor cost capitalization of million associated with development work related to sunrisexa sunrisexa was released in december of the impact of higher cost capitalization was somewhat offset by higher labor related costs of million on increased headcount and higher incentive compensation on improved financial performance 
our gross research and development spending  which consists of research and development expenses and capitalized software development costs  increased million to million in compared to million in in summary  research and development expense was as follows in thousands change change research and development expenses capitalized software development costs gross research and development expenses amortization of capitalized software development costs general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  in the increase was primarily related to million of higher professional service fees  including million of incremental legal and accounting fees associated with our voluntary stock option review and related derivative lawsuit 
additional increases in general and administrative expenses include higher labor related costs reflecting increased headcount and higher incentive compensation due to improved financial performance 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  in compared to the increase was primarily the result of higher depreciation associated with the increased asset base related to the continued growth of our operations 
restructuring charges were million in compared to million in the restructuring expenses related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters from boca raton  florida to atlanta  georgia  which commenced in october to consolidate more of the company s operations in one location and provide a more accessible location for existing and potential clients as well as employees 
the charges related to this plan primarily consisted of severance related expenses associated with the termination of impacted employees and included one time termination benefits and retention bonus expenses 
the plan is expected to be substantially complete in the first quarter of  with total restructuring expenses expected to approximate million  which includes the million incurred in the restructuring charges related to the reduction of headcount and the consolidation of office space 
in january  we effected a restructuring of our operations which included a reduction in headcount of approximately individuals  as part of the reorganization of our company 
this was undertaken to better align our organization  reduce costs  and re invest some of the cost savings into client related activities including client support and professional services 
in december  we realigned certain management resources and consolidated certain facilities to eliminate excess office space 
the activities resulted in restructuring charges of million in the year ended december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
gain on sale of assets in december  the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with elsevier inc elsevier pursuant to which elsevier acquired certain assets of our clinical practice model resource center cpmrc business including cpmrc s proprietary clinical practice guidelines and related intellectual property  content  assumed certain cpmrc content customer contracts and retained related cpmrc employees for million in cash 
the transaction resulted in a net gain of million comprised of the following in thousands cash received cpmrc earnout settlement payment net assets sold other costs gain on sale in connection with this transaction the company  for million  settled the remaining earnout obligation under the cpmrc acquisition agreement and reflected this as a reduction of the gain on sale 
in addition to the aforementioned proceeds from sale  the company can earn up to an additional million over the next years in the event elsevier meets certain sales targets  we are successful in obtaining permission from a customer to transfer its contract to elsevier  and we complete certain minor data base application development for elsevier 
if these milestones are met  we would reflect any contingent consideration received as additional gain on the sale of cpmrc 
in connection with the sale  the company and elsevier entered into reseller and license agreements to allow eclipsys to continue to acquire cpmrc content and services from elsevier in order to support existing and possible new customers who use eclipsys knowledge based charting software application  which contains the cpmrc content 
interest income  net interest income increased million  or  in compared to the increase was due to interest received on higher marketable securities balances and an improvement in yields on marketable securities in interest income in is expected to be offset in part by interest obligations on borrowings under short term financing arrangements we entered into in february  and any longer term financing arrangements we may enter into in the future 
see liquidity and capital resources below for more information

the utilization of the pre acquisition loss resulted in a corresponding reduction to goodwill 
the benefit was also offset by accruals of probable foreign taxes and penalties relating to transfer pricing  pursuant to fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas as of december   a valuation allowance of approximately million has been established against the us deferred tax assets that management does not believe are more likely than not to be realized 
this determination is based primarily on the company s recent history of taxable losses  operating losses and uncertainty with respect to its forecasted results 
we will continue to assess the requirement for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
should the company achieve its forecasted results we may determine from our valuation allowance assessment that the positive evidence outweighs the negative resulting in the release of all or a portion of the allowance 
the company is currently analyzing its research and development expenditures for eligibility to qualify for a research and development r d tax credit 
the company plans to complete this analysis in and as a result expects to record a deferred tax asset for this potential tax benefit  net of a reduction of a portion of its deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards

these actions resulted in restructuring charges of million in interest income  net interest income increased million to million in compared to million in the increase was due to an improvement in yields on marketable securities as well as higher marketable securities balances

future capital requirements as of december   our principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances of million 
of this balance  the company has approximately million invested in certain aaa rated auction rate securities ars  which generally can be sold via dutch auctions every   or days creating a short term instrument 
however  recent uncertainties in the credit markets have disrupted scheduled auctions  resulting in the company and other investors deciding to continue to hold their ars until auctions recur or other sources of liquidity for these investments becomes available 
our current plan is to hold the ars until such time as successful auctions would occur or the secondary market allows for a sufficient price to recover substantially all of our carrying value 
there can be no assurance this will occur 
however  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and our non ars marketable securities  combined with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
our future cash requirements will depend on a number of factors including  among other things  the timing and level of our new sales volumes  the cost of our development efforts  the success and market acceptance of our future product releases  and other related items 
the company also periodically evaluates business opportunities that fit its strategic plans  such as with our february acquisition of enterprise performance systems  inc epsi 
if an opportunity requiring significant capital investment were to arise  the company would seek to finance the opportunity through available cash on hand  existing financings  issuance of additional shares of its stock or additional sources of financing  as circumstances warrant 
however  there can be no assurance that adequate liquidity would be available to finance extraordinary business opportunities 
in february we entered into a secured financing agreement with an investment bank  pursuant to which we received million in exchange for a transfer to the bank as a form of collateral of ars with a nominal value of million in the aggregate 
the company entered into this arrangement to provide funds to close our february acquisition of epsi 
we plan to replace this short term arrangement with proceeds from a longer term commercial credit facility  sale of ars  or a combination of both 
additionally  a secondary market has developed and could become a source of liquidity for our ars 
however  selling our ars at current prices available in the secondary market would most likely result in receiving an amount less than the carrying value of the ars and thus resulting in a realized loss on the sale 
there is no assurance that these alternative sources of liquidity will be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and item a for further information 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contracts and commitments the following table provides information related to our contractual obligations under various financial and commercial agreements as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total the unconditional purchase obligations consist of minimum purchase commitments for telecommunication services  computer equipment  maintenance  consulting and other commitments 
these amounts are expected to be funded from current cash and cash equivalent balances and the income generated from operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments or enter into foreign currency hedge transactions 
foreign currency fluctuations through december  have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we have invested in high quality securities including auction rate securities ars 
these ars are debt instruments with long term nominal maturities that generally can be sold via dutch auctions every   or days creating a short term instrument 
in february  broker dealers holding the company s ars portfolio experienced failed auctions of certain ars where the amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of related purchase orders 
the ars held by the company continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  and have not been downgraded nor have they been placed on credit watch by credit rating agencies 
if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue and these markets deteriorate further or the company experiences any rating downgrades on any investments in its portfolio  the company may incur temporary or other than temporary impairments  which could negatively affect the company s financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the following table illustrates potential fluctuation in annualized interest income based upon hypothetical values for blended interest rates for hypothetical marketable securities balances hypothetical interest rate marketable securities balances in thousands we estimate that a one percentage point decrease in interest rates for our marketable securities portfolio as of december  would have resulted in a decrease in interest income of million for a twelve month period 
this sensitivity analysis contains certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period  and it does not consider the impact of changes in the portfolio as a result of our business needs or as a response to changes in the market 
therefore  although it gives an indication of our exposure to changes in interest rates  it is not intended to predict future results and our actual results will likely vary
