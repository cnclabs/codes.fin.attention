item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview emeritus corporation is a washington corporation founded by daniel r 
baty and two other long time associates in mr 
baty is chairman of our board of directors  co chief executive officer  and one of our largest shareholders 
he is also a party to a number of agreements with us and is referred to frequently in discussions of the business 
in november  we completed our initial public offering 
from through  we expanded rapidly through acquisition and internal development and by december   operated assisted living communities with  units 
we believe  however  that during this expansion  the assisted living industry became over built  creating an environment characterized by sluggish or falling occupancy and market resistance to rate increases 
as a result  in we began an increased focus first on raising our occupancy and later on rate development  operating efficiencies  and cost controls 
this focus has continued throughout we believe the operating environment of the assisted living industry has been improving over the past several years resulting in occupancy gains and increases in the average monthly rate 
these operating improvements have also resulted in greater access to capital 
we believe these dynamics have resulted in the consolidation of smaller local and regional operators into the larger national operators  and anticipate this consolidation of the industry will continue 
because of these circumstances  we have been able to complete several acquisitions or leases in the last few years  although at a slower pace in and  and at an increased rate in although opportunities for further expansion have been available over the past few years  we have been selective in our growth as we have seen a sharp increase in market prices 
on september   we acquired summerville senior living  inc summerville  which operated communities comprising  units in states  providing independent living  assisted living  and alzheimer s and dementia related services to seniors 
see significant transactions summerville acquisition below 
in recent years we focused on internal growth through expansion of existing properties and construction of new communities 
this focus continued through we currently have expansion projects in eight of our communities and will continue to look at other expansion opportunities where the market conditions are favorable 
in addition  we have several development projects in various stages of completion in several locations 
from the beginning of through december   we have increased our owned and leased communities by and  respectively  for a net increase in our consolidated portfolio of in addition  we have decreased our number of managed communities by  thereby increasing our total operated portfolio by communities 
those communities we own and lease  and which are included in our consolidated portfolio  increased from at the beginning of to at december   reflecting both our increasing confidence in the assisted living industry and the availability of capital 
in  we expect to continue our focus on increasing occupancy and rates  as well as reviewing acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents the following table sets forth a summary of our property interests 
as of december  as of december  as of december  buildings units buildings units buildings units owned leased consolidated portfolio managed admin services joint venture partnership operated portfolio percentage increase decrease owned communities increased since december primarily through the acquisition of communities we formerly operated under long term leases i fretus purchase of communities in february  ii hrt purchase of communities in march  iii hcpi purchase of seven communities in march  iv hc reit purchase of three communities in august  v hcpi purchase of communities in august  including eight summerville communities  vi wegman purchase of nine communities in august  and vii the purchase of one additional community in december of the leased communities at december   are accounted for as operating leases  in which the assets and liabilities of the communities are not included in our consolidated balance sheet and are accounted for as capital leases  in which a long term asset and corresponding liability is established on our balance sheet 
the remaining four leased communities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as owned communities because of accounting requirements related to sale leaseback accounting  notwithstanding the legal sale of the communities and their subsequent leasing by us 
since  we have terminated management agreements on three communities and started managing four additional communities 
the percentage increase indicates the change from the prior year 
two of the important factors affecting our financial results are the rates we charge our residents and the occupancy levels we achieve in our communities 
we rely primarily on our residents ability to pay our charges for services from their own or family resources and expect that we will do so for the foreseeable future 
although care in an assisted living community is typically less expensive than in a skilled nursing facility  we believe that generally only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the regional median can afford to reside in our communities 
in this context  we must be sensitive to our residents financial circumstances and remain aware that rates and occupancy are interrelated 
in evaluating the rate component  we generally rely on the average monthly revenue per unit  computed by dividing the total operating revenue for a particular period by the average number of occupied units for the same period 
in evaluating the occupancy component  we generally rely on an average occupancy rate  computed by dividing the average units occupied during a particular period by the average number of units available during the period 
we evaluate these and other operating components for our consolidated portfolio  which includes the communities we own and lease  and our operating portfolio  which also includes the communities we manage 
in our consolidated portfolio  our average monthly revenue per unit increased from  to  and to  in   and  respectively 
the change from to represents an increase of  or and from to  an increase of  or 
although summerville s portfolio had a higher average monthly revenue per unit than emeritus s portfolio  the impact of summerville was insignificant on the overall average increase in since they have only been a part of the consolidated group for four months 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents in our consolidated portfolio  our average occupancy rate in was and increased to and in and  respectively 
we believe that this increase in occupancy rates reflects industry wide factors  such as the declining supply of vacant units  as well as our own actions and policies 
summerville has a higher average occupancy rate than emeritus  but as noted above  its impact is slight on the overall increase because it has only been a part of the portfolio for four months 
we continue to evaluate the factors of rate and occupancy to find the optimum balance in each community  as witnessed by the increase in occupancy rates and average monthly revenue per unit from through since our inception in  we have incurred cumulative operating losses totaling approximately million as of december  we believe that these losses have resulted from our early emphasis on expansion  financing costs arising from multiple financing and refinancing transactions related to this expansion  administrative and corporate expenses that we incurred in anticipation of further expansion and increased emphasis on risk management and financial reporting controls  the impact in the early years on many of our leases from capital and financing lease treatments  and occupancy rates remaining lower for longer periods than we anticipated 
while we have realized growth in both our occupancy and average monthly rates  we anticipate continued losses in the near term until such time as our occupancy stabilizes 
our current emphasis is on maximization of cash flows as we work toward improvements in occupancy and average rates  selective growth  and changes in our capital structure  such as acquisition of leased properties and refinancing of existing high rate debt 
significant transactions from through  and continuing into  we entered into a number of transactions that affected the number of communities we own  lease  and manage  our financing arrangements  and our capital structure 
these transactions are summarized below

table of contents results of operations summary of critical accounting policies and use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to resident programs and incentives such as move in fees  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring  long term service contracts  contingencies  self insured retention  health insurance  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are most significant with respect to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revisions in such estimates are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we are self insured for professional liability claims and accrue losses based upon actuarial estimates of the total aggregate liability for claims within the current year  plus related administrative expenses 
we make periodic adjustments to our total liability for all open years from through if actuarial estimates suggest our exposure has changed 
losses are covered through a self insurance pool agreement  which includes of our managed communities on a unit of capacity basis 
should losses exceed the actuarial estimates  additional expense may be accrued at the time of such determination 
we deposit funds with an administrator based in part on a fixed schedule and in part as losses are actually paid 
the funds held by the administrator are recorded as a prepaid asset  which as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
the prepaid asset is reduced as claims are paid from the account 
for health insurance  we self insure each covered member up to  per incident  above which a catastrophic insurance policy covers any additional costs for certain covered members 
health insurance expense is accrued based upon historical experience of the aggregate liability for claims incurred 
if these estimates are insufficient  additional charges may be required 
workers compensation insurance coverage applies for specific insurable states excluding texas  washington  ohio  and west virginia through a high deductible  collateralized insurance policy 
the policy premium is based upon standard rates applied to estimated annual payroll 
we contract with an independent third party administrator to administer the claims  and claim expenses are paid from the collateral account 
the sum of the premium and related costs  estimated administration costs  and actuarial based estimated losses is accrued each month based on actual payroll 
the cash collateral paid under the plan is carried as a prepaid asset on the balance sheet and is reduced as claims are paid from the account by the administrator 
as of december  and the deposit was million and million  respectively 
at policy expiration each year  an insurer audit is conducted to adjust premiums based on actual  rather than estimated  annual payroll 
the insurer also audits the total incurred claim amount at least annually and may adjust the applicable policy year collateral requirement 
if there is a reasonable expectation that the total incurred losses will be less than the posted collateral  then the excess cash collateral will be returned to the company 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents as of january   we account for stock option awards in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for  generally  all share based payment transactions with employees 
the fair value based method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk free interest rates  stock price volatility  dividend yield  and weighted average option life 
under this application  we are required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that were outstanding at the date of adoption 
before the adoption of sfas no 
r  we applied accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for stock based awards 
under this method  no compensation expense was recorded provided the exercise price was equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our residents to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our residents were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized  which at this time reflects a net asset valuation of zero 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
however  in the event we were to determine that we would more likely than not to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
primarily due to the gain on sale of our investment in alterra  we utilized most of our available tax loss and tax credit carryforwards in  and acquired additional tax losses in related to the acquisition of summerville 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values 
the annual test requires estimates and judgments by management to determine valuations for each reporting unit 
we performed our annual impairment test as of october   and concluded that no impairment charge was required 
although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
different assumptions related to future cash flows  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates could result in an impairment charge  which would be recognized as a non cash charge to operating income and a reduction in asset values on the balance sheet 
long lived assets  including property and equipment  long term investments  and amortizable intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment quarterly or annually  or whenever a change in condition occurs that indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable 
such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans  changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual communities 
we use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of long lived assets depending on their nature and use 
such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized  as well as market values and conditions 
the computation of expected future net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions 
any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value

table of contents we account for leases as operating  capital  or financing leases depending on the underlying terms 
the determination of the classification of leases is complex and in certain situations requires a significant level of judgment 
leases are generally accounted for as operating leases to the extent the underlying lease does not i transfer ownership by the end of the lease term  ii contain a bargain purchase option  iii include a lease term equal to or greater than of the economic life of the leased property  or iv include minimum lease payments for which the present value equals or exceeds of the fair value of the underlying leased property 
those leases that meet one of the criteria described above cannot be accounted for as operating leases but are accounted for as capital leases 
properties that are sold and leased back and for which we have continuing involvement are accounted for as financing arrangements  in which the property remains on the balance sheet and a financing obligation is recorded that is generally equal to the purchase price of the properties sold 
our accounting policy regarding contingent liabilities is to recognize obligations if they are probable and estimable based on management s best estimate of the ultimate outcome 
if a legal judgment is rendered against us or a settlement offer has been tendered  then we believe that we have a probable liability and we accrue the full amount of the judgment or settlement offer 
our long term investments consist of investments in joint ventures with equity interests ranging from to 
we account for these investments under the equity method of accounting 
in determining the accounting treatment for these investments  we consider various factors such as our ownership interest  our ability to influence decisions  our participating rights  and whether the joint venture is a variable interest entity  and if so  whether we are the primary beneficiary 
we review the recoverability of our investments at least quarterly  or whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired 
in the normal course of business  we use derivative instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risk 
to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  we may use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date 
for the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives  long term investments and long term debt  standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized

net loss and property related expense in comparing the net losses for and  management believes it is important to consider the impact of lease accounting on our property related expenses  which includes depreciation and amortization  facility lease expense  and interest expense that is directly related to our communities 
the property related expenses directly associated with our accounting for leases  which includes operating leases  capital leases  financing leases  straight line accounting for rent escalators for many of our operating leases  and amortization of above and below market rents related to the summerville acquisition is presented in the table below 
these lease accounting treatments generally result in greater property related expense than actual lease payments made in the early years of the affected leases and less property related expense than actual lease payments made in later years

the impact of lease accounting decreased by  in the current year from the comparable period last year due primarily to the summerville acquisition  partially offset by a reduction in interest expense on the capital leases in connection with the normal paydown of the lease obligation and the termination of leases related to the acquisition of the underlying real estate of the fretus  hrt  hc reit  wegman  and hcpi communities 
notwithstanding the effects of lease accounting treatment  the actual lease payments required under most of our leases will continue to increase annually and  as a result  we will need to improve our results from community operations to cover these increases 
however  in the year ended december   the actual lease payments decreased due to the acquisition transactions discussed above under significant transactions 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and total operating revenues year ended december  d d in thousands community revenue management fees total operating revenues this increase in total community revenues of million resulted in part from additional revenues related to the acquisition or lease of eight communities from january   to the end of these additional communities represented an increase in revenue of approximately million for the remaining increase of million  or  resulted primarily from an increase in the average revenue per unit  which accounted for million of the increase  and an increase in occupancy rates  which accounted for million of the increase 
year ended december  d d average monthly revenue per occupied unit average occupancy rate 
ppt occupancy grew as a result of marketing initiatives in existing communities and due to the acquisition or leasing of eight additional communities with higher occupancy levels 
the increase in revenue per unit was primarily attributable to rate increases in the previously existing communities and higher occupancy in our higher rate memory loss units 
management fees decreased by  in the year ended december   primarily due to the net reduction in management agreements during the year  excluding the management agreements added in december community operations year ended december  d d in thousands community operations as a percent of revenue ppt community operations expense excludes a million reduction in our professional and general liability insurance accrual that resulted from the settlement of a lawsuit for an amount less than the original accrual for the action  which is shown as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations and is further discussed under legal proceedings 
significant factors impacting the change in community operating expense between the periods were adjustments to our professional and general liability insurance accrual 
we recorded an additional million professional and general liability insurance accrual in to reflect the settlement experience of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents claims closed during the year  primarily from claims originating in and  and to reflect an updated estimate of ultimate losses for all years from to  based upon an actuarial valuation report 
however  in  considering the updated settlement claims history  we reduced our professional and general liability insurance accrual by million  based upon an updated actuarial valuation report 
thus  the impact on the change from year to year of these two adjustments was an expense reduction of million 
another factor impacting the change in community operating expenses between the periods was a reduction in workers compensation expense of million due to revised estimates of our ultimate exposure under our workers compensation programs and claims paid history 
the adjustment was based upon an actuarial valuation report 
an additional factor impacting the change in community operating expenses between the periods was an accrual of million recorded in related to the texas medicaid settlement discussed under legal proceedings 
aside from the items noted above  community operations expense increased million  or 
approximately million of this increase was from the addition of eight new communities 
of the remaining increase of million in community operations expense  approximately million was increased staffing costs and approximately million was due to increases in utilities and repairs and maintenance expenses 
the remaining difference resulted from increases of million in various other operating costs  primarily marketing  food costs  bad debts  supplies  telephone and cable service  partially offset by net decreases in various smaller items 
general and administrative year ended december  d d in thousands general and administrative as a percent of revenue ppt we experienced increases of approximately million in personnel costs  which represented added personnel and related compensation increases  and a million increase in stock option compensation expense from the implementation of a new accounting standard

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents facility lease expense year ended december  d d in thousands facility lease expense as a percent of revenue 
ppt the increase in facility lease expense of million was partially due to the operating lease of two new communities that were operated for less than a full year in  which accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the remaining increase of million was primarily attributable to lease terms that provide for periodic increases in rent based on contingent factors such as cost indices or revenue volumes 
we leased communities under operating leases as of december  and interest income year ended december  d d in thousands interest income as a percent of revenue

interest expense increased by  after adjusting for the settlement impact noted above 
this increase is primarily due to an increase in interest expense of million relating to debt financing associated with three new arkansas communities acquired in december   relating to two new communities under capital leases acquired in march   from the new million loan we entered into in connection with our series b preferred stock conversion in june   related to the acquisition of arbor place in july  offset by a decline in interest expense from the paydown of principal balances over the past year

the provision for income taxes for the year ended december   is due to federal and state income and franchise tax liabilities on operating income primarily due to differences between tax and financial accounting treatment for capital and financing and straight line lease expense and from gains on sale of our alterra and senior med investments 
net income loss and property related expense in comparing the net loss for to the net income for  management believes it is important to consider the impact of lease accounting on our property related expenses  which includes depreciation and amortization  facility lease expense  and interest expense that is directly related to our communities

while the impact of lease accounting declined by million in the current year from last year  the total impact in both periods is significant to our overall operating results 
it should be noted that  notwithstanding the effects of lease accounting treatment  the actual lease payments required under most of our leases will continue to increase annually and  as a result  we will need to improve our results from community operations to cover these increases

we will continue our efforts to build our occupancy through increased marketing initiatives  programs that address resident mix and a focus on property improvements and other community level enhancements to attract additional long term residents and increase occupancy while maintaining growth in average monthly revenue per unit 
we believe that these initiatives will continue to have a positive impact on operating performance over time 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash on hand of million compared to million at december  we had working capital deficits of million and million at december  and  respectively 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and have a working capital deficit of million at december  due to the nature of our business  it is not unusual to operate in the position of a working capital deficit because revenues are collected much more quickly  often in advance  than obligations are required to be paid 
the result is a very low level of current assets to the extent cash has been deployed in business development opportunities or to pay down long term liabilities 
along those lines  the working capital deficit includes million of deferred revenue and unearned rental income 
the level of current liabilities is not expected to increase from year to year in such a way as to require the use of significant cash  except for debt maturities  capital and financing lease obligations  and debentures of million scheduled to be due in we intend to pay or refinance these obligations prior to their respective due dates 
management believes that we will be able to sustain positive operating cash flow or have adequate cash reserves for all necessary operating  investing and financing activities including required debt service and capital expenditures through at least in   and  we reported positive net cash from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash provided by operating activities increased by million from to by purchasing the real estate underlying leased facilities  we replaced lease payments with lower levels of debt service and also avoided scheduled lease escalators 
however  in the past cash flows have not always been sufficient to pay all of our long term obligations and we have been dependent upon third party financing or disposition of assets to fund operations 
we cannot guarantee that  if necessary in the future  such transactions will be available timely or at all  or on terms attractive to us  but we believe that we will be able to sustain positive operating cash flow or have adequate cash reserves and sources of capital for all necessary investing and financing activities including required debt service and capital expenditures through at least in february  we obtained a million unsecured revolving line of credit 
the united states economy experienced a significant decline in the housing market and a related weakness in the availability and affordability of credit during we believe that the slowdown in the housing market and the constriction of credit are likely to continue into moreover  leading economic indicators such as employment levels and income growth predict a downward trend in the united states economy during  and some commentators have predicted a recession 
however  we believe that need driven demand for our services continues to grow and remains resilient  in spite of the overall housing and economic concerns  as management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued

at december   we had payment obligations for long term debt  capital and financing leases  and convertible debentures due in totaling approximately million 
in addition  for the year ending december   we anticipate that we will make investments of approximately million to million for capital expenditures  comprised of approximately million to million of net recurring capital expenditures including corporate capital expenditures and approximately million to million of net capital expenditures in connection with our community expansion and development program 
we had million of available cash at december   to fund any payment requirements in excess of cash generated from operations 
the convertible debentures in the amount of million due in july are convertible into common stock at per share 
as of february   our stock price was 
if our common stock trades at a value per share in excess of the conversion rate  then we believe the debentures will likely be converted to common stock and not require the use of cash 
we are currently in the process of refinancing million in long term debt due in august which is secured by the assets of five communities owned by us 
we also extended the term of a million note payable due in march to march however  we cannot be assured that the trading value of our common stock will continue to exceed the conversion rate  or the expected refinancing of million mortgage debt will be successful 
therefore  we will need to continue our improvements in operating performance or seek other sources of cash to meet our payment obligations in future years 
as a consequence of our property and lease transactions in  our long term debt has increased from million at december   to million at december  our obligations under operating leases have increased from million to million primarily due to the summerville acquisition  and our capital lease and financing obligations have decreased from million to million 
many of our debt instruments and leases contain cross default provisions pursuant to which a default under one obligation can cause a default under one or more other obligations to the same lender or lessor 
such cross default provisions affect the majority of our properties 
accordingly  any event of default could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition if such debt or leases are cross defaulted 
defaults can include certain financial covenants  which generally relate to lease coverage and cash flow 
in addition  we are required to maintain the leased properties in a reasonable and prudent manner 
for the year ended december   we were in violation of one or more covenants in certain of our leases  but obtained waivers from the owners such that we were still deemed to be in compliance and thus  were not in default 
the waivers expire on january  on february   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association  which provides a million unsecured revolving line of credit 
the credit agreement permits us to borrow from time to time up to million on an unsecured basis 
the credit agreement includes a letter of credit feature that allows us to obtain letters of credit from the lender  provided that the undrawn amount of any outstanding letters of credit and any borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement does not exceed million 
the line of credit matures on february  outstanding borrowings will bear interest at a variable rate of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents one half of one percent below wells fargo s prime rate 
interest is payable on a monthly basis 
we may partially or wholly repay borrowings and reborrow provided that the total outstanding borrowings may not at any time exceed million 
we are required to pay an unused commitment fee of a quarter percent per annum on the average daily unused amount of the line of credit 
the commitment fee is payable on a quarterly basis 
in addition  we are required to pay fees equal to one percent of the face amount of every letter of credit issued as well as the negotiation fees on each letter 
we must maintain a zero balance on advances for consecutive days during each fiscal year and a million minimum balance in cash  cash equivalents and or publicly traded marketable securities 
the line of credit agreement contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant 
the agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including  among other things  covenants regarding the delivery of financial statements  certificates and notice requirements  payment obligations including taxes  preservation of existence  maintenance of properties and insurance policies  compliance with laws  keeping of records and use of proceeds  minimum liquidity  and limitations on incurring indebtedness 
the line of credit agreement contains certain events of default including  among other things  non payment of principal  interest or fees  violation of covenants  invalidity of any loan document  material judgments  bankruptcy and insolvency events and change of control 
upon an event of default  wells fargo may accelerate the loans and terminate lending 
in the event of default  interest on the outstanding amount of the indebtedness shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to four percent in excess of the interest rate in effect at that time 
we intend to use the line of credit for general business purposes

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r replaces the existing sfas no 
but retains the fundamental requirements in sfas no 
that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
sfas no 
r defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control 
it also requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date 
the additional fair value measurements of sfas no 
r replace the cost allocation process of sfas no 
 which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
in addition  expenses incurred for all acquisition related costs are to be expensed and liabilities related to contingent consideration are to be remeasured to fair value each subsequent reporting period 
costs incurred by the acquirer to effect the acquisition are not allocated to the assets acquired or liabilities assumed  but are recognized separately 
sfas no 
r is effective prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure financial assets and liabilities except for those that are specifically exempted from the statement at fair value 
the election to measure a financial asset or liability at fair value can be made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
the difference between carrying value and fair value at the election date is recorded as a transition adjustment to opening retained earnings 
subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
the effective date for sfas is as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we are evaluating sfas and have not yet determined the impact the adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements  but it is not expected to be significant 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  effective january  the adoption of this statement did not have a significant effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized  it would not have a material effect on our effective tax rate 
we recognize interest and or tax penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
we believe we have appropriate support for the income tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and that the accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of relevant factors  including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter 
our open years for federal tax returns are through management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurement 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are evaluating the impact of adopting sfas we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on us 
inflation could  however  affect our future revenues and operating income due to our dependence on the senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
the monthly charges for the resident s unit and assisted living services are influenced by the location of the community and local competition 
our ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
we typically do not rely to a significant extent on governmental reimbursement programs  which accounted for approximately of revenues for the year ended december  in pricing our services  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future 
the near term negative economic outlook in the united states may impact our ability to raise our prices 
non gaap measures a non gaap financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position  or cash flows  but excludes or includes amounts that would not be included in most gaap measures 
in this report  we define and use the non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda  as set forth below definition of adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as follows net income loss to common shareholders before preferred stock dividends  gains or losses  net of tax  in discontinued operations  provision or benefit for income taxes  equity earnings or losses in unconsolidated joint ventures  gains or losses on sale of assets or investments  depreciation and amortization  impairment losses  amortization of deferred gains  non cash stock option compensation expense  interest expense  interest income  and other non cash unusual adjustments adjusted ebitda management s use of adjusted ebitda we use adjusted ebitda to assess our overall financial and operating performance 
we believe this non gaap measure  as we have defined it  is useful in identifying trends in our day to day performance because it excludes items that have little or no significance on our day to day operations 
this measure provides an management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
adjusted ebitda provides us with a measure of financial performance  independent of items that are beyond the control of management in the short term  such as depreciation and amortization  taxation  and interest expense associated with our capital structure 
this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
adjusted ebitda is one of the metrics used by senior management to review the financial performance of the business on a monthly basis and is also used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the performance and value of the companies in our industry 
limitations of adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures of earnings 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our earnings losses to calculate adjusted ebitda and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to gaap net income loss include the following 
the items excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda generally represent income or expense items that may have a significant affect on our financial results  items determined to be non recurring in nature could  nevertheless  re occur in the future  and depreciation and amortization  while not directly impacting our current cash position  does represent wear and tear and or reduction in value of our properties 
if the cost to maintain our properties exceeds our expected routine capital expenditures  then this could affect our ability to attract and retain long term residents at our communities 
an investor or potential investor may find this important in evaluating our performance and results of operations 
we use this non gaap measure to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
adjusted ebitda is not an alternative to net income loss  income from continuing operations  or cash flows provided by or used in operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on adjusted ebitda as a substitute for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of gaap net income loss to adjusted ebitda presented below  along with our consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  because adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  this measure as presented may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

table of contents the table below shows the reconciliation of net loss to adjusted ebitda for the three months and year ended december   and three months ended year ended december  december  net loss provision for benefit of income taxes equity losses gains in unconsolidated joint ventures depreciation and amortization impairment loss on long lived assets and long term investments amortization of deferred gains non cash stock option compensation expenses convertible debentures conversion costs interest expense interest income other non cash unusual activity reversal of texas settlement accrued in professional and workers compensation liability adjustments adjusted ebitda subsequent events nhp purchase on february   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement the purchase agreement with nationwide health properties  inc nhp to purchase communities consisting of  units located in states for a purchase price of million  excluding transaction costs 
we currently lease these communities from nhp sixteen of the communities under a master lease since april  and the remaining communities under various leases since through and operated the communities as assisted living and dementia care facilities 
we made a deposit of million related to this purchase agreement 
the deposit is refundable if we elect to terminate the agreement during the day due diligence period or the day title due diligence period 
the properties are subject to approximately million of mortgage debt which will be repaid at closing or assumed by us and deducted from the purchase price 
we expect to finance this transaction through mortgage debt of approximately million assuming the million will be repaid by nhp at closing  a million loan provided by nhp at the closing and the balance from available cash on hand 
the nhp loan will bear interest at an annual rate of and be payable monthly on an interest only basis for a term of not more than four years 
we have the option to prepay the nhp loan at any time 
both parties respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the purchase agreement are subject to customary closing conditions 
we expect to incur a one time charge of approximately million related to prepayment penalties on the debt repayment mentioned above  and expect to close the transaction by the end of the second quarter of annual lease payments are approximately million related to these communities  including a newly constructed community opened in january we account for these leases as capital leases and recorded interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  upon termination of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 
table of contents the capital leases  the difference between the carrying amount of the capital lease assets and the capital lease obligations will be recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the purchased communities 
this reduction in the cost basis of the purchased assets is estimated to be approximately million as of the closing date 
amendment to loan agreement effective march   we and nhp amended our existing loan agreement related to our million note due march  the amendment extended the maturity date to march  and reduced the interest rate from to per annum

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates due to our financing activities and changes in the availability of credit 
the table below provides information about our debt and capital lease and financing obligations  including weighted average interest rates on these obligations as of december  expected maturity date in thousands thereafter total fair value average interest rate long term debt fixed rate capital lease and financing obligations convertible debentures our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our short term and long term borrowings 
at december   we had approximately million of variable rate borrowings based on the libor rate 
as of december   our weighted average variable rate is in excess of the libor rate 
for every change in the libor rate  our interest expense will change by approximately million annually 
this analysis does not consider changes in the actual level of borrowings or operating lease obligations that may occur subsequent to december  this analysis also does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment  nor does it consider actions that management might be able to take with respect to our financial structure to mitigate the exposure to such a change 
we currently have a million interest rate swap contract that matures in august a basis point increase in interest rates would increase the fair value of this swap by approximately  and a basis point decrease in interest rates would decrease the fair value of this swap contracts by approximately  the downturn in the united states housing market in triggered a constriction in the availability of credit that is expected to continue in this could impact our ability to borrow money or refinance existing obligations at acceptable rates of interest 
thus far  we have experienced no significant barriers to obtaining credit and do not expect to in the near future
