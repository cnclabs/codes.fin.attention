item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business trends our corporate structure includes separate pay per transaction ppt and advanced media and information ami operating divisions and  accordingly  we report certain financial information by individual segment under this structure 
our ppt division focuses on managing our business operations that facilitate the delivery of home entertainment content products dvds  blu ray discs  etc 
and related rental and sales information for the content to home video specialty stores and other retailers  on a revenue sharing basis 
we lease product from various suppliers  typically motion picture studios 
under our ppt system  retailers sublease that product from us and rent it to consumers 
retailers then share a portion of the revenue from each retail rental transaction with us and we share a portion of the revenue with the studio 
since we collect  process and analyze rental and sales information at the title level  we report that information to both the studio and the respective retailers 
effective april   we moved our direct revenue sharing drs line of business from the ami division to the ppt division 
prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
our drs services collect  track  audit and report the results of drs retailers  such as blockbuster entertainment  movie gallery and netflix  to the respective drs client under established agreements on a fee for service basis 
our ami division concentrates on the management and growth of our essentials suite of business information services 
our essentials suite software and services  offered on a recurring subscription basis  provide unique data collection  management  analysis and reporting functions  resulting in business information valuable to our clients 
the ppt division the financial results from the ppt division continue to be affected by the changing dynamics in the home video rental market 
this market is highly competitive and influenced greatly by consumer spending patterns and behaviors 
the end consumer has a wide variety of choices from which to select their entertainment content 
some examples include renting units of product from our participating retailers or other retailers  purchasing previously viewed units from our participating retailers or other retailers  ordering product via online subscriptions and or online distributors  subscribing to at home movie channels  purchasing and owning the unit directly  or selecting an at home pay per view or on demand option 
our ppt system focuses on the traditional brick and mortar retailer 
we believe that our system successfully addresses the many choices available to consumers and affords our participating retailers the opportunity to stock their stores with a wider selection of titles and a greater supply of popular box office releases 
most of our arrangements are structured so that the participating retailers pay minimal upfront fees and lower per transaction fees in exchange for ordering units of all titles offered by a particular program supplier referred to as output programs 
since these programs usually result in more overall units rented  our participating retailers revenue and the corresponding share with the studios have increased 
these programs are  in part  an economic response to the changing dynamics of the home video rental market 
we expect the growth of these output programs to continue  and believe that they will be financially beneficial for the participating retailers  program suppliers and us 
our base of participating retailers continues to be strong and we are implementing strategies to obtain new participating retailers and program suppliers  as well as assist in the growth of our current participating retailers  in an effort to further stabilize and grow our overall ppt revenue and earnings streams 
our agreement with our fifth largest program supplier expired march  while we continued to receive some new product from a division of that program supplier during fiscal  the amounts were significantly less due to the loss of the other divisions 
this program supplier entered into a new arrangement with us in april and will begin to supply units to the ppt system in june we 
table of contents continue to be in good standing with our remaining program suppliers and we make on going efforts to enhance those business relationships through improvement of current services offered and the development of new service offerings 
we are also continually seeking to develop business relationships with new program suppliers 
in november  based on our successful involvement with a major studio in canada  we entered into a revenue sharing agreement with that studio s us operator  which extends product offerings to participating retailers in the us this agreement was effective for titles released beginning in january  giving our us participating retailers access to the large volume of high quality entertainment that this major studio has been delivering for years  and yielding of our total revenues in fiscal also  in october  we began offering product from a major studio to our us participating retailers  yielding of our total revenues in fiscal two additional program suppliers represented and  respectively  of our total revenues in fiscal as is typical of our agreements with program suppliers  most of our relationships with these program suppliers may be terminated without cause upon thirty days written notice by either party 
ami and other divisions we are also allocating significant resources towards our business information service offerings  both those services that are currently operational as well as those that are in various stages of development 
our suite of business information services has been well received in the various targeted markets to date  as our offerings fit well with the needs identified by those market participants 
our essentials business information service offerings which are fully operational and no longer in significant stages of development  realized a revenue increase of during fiscal compared to fiscal we intend to continue to invest in our existing  as well as new  business information services in the near term as we expand the markets we serve and our service lines 
the cost of these investments will likely lower our earnings 
longer term  we believe these services will provide significant future revenue and earnings streams and contribute to our overall success 
sources of revenue revenue by segment includes the following ppt division order processing fees generated when units are ordered by  and distributed to  retailers  transaction fees generated when retailers rent units to consumers  additionally  certain arrangements include guaranteed minimum revenues from our customers  we recognize the guaranteed minimum revenue on the street release date in accordance with statement of position  accounting by producers or distributors of films  sop provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met  sell through fees generated when retailers sell previously viewed rental units to consumers  buy out fees generated when retailers purchase units at the end of the lease term  and drs fees from data tracking and reporting services provided to program suppliers

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal percentage increase decrease in units shipped effect of increase decrease in units shipped on revenue million million increase decrease in fee per unit effect of increase decrease in fee per unit on revenue million million the decrease in volume in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an overall weakness in the quality of titles released in fiscal compared to fiscal and the decline in volume received from one of our major program suppliers 
this program supplier represented  and  respectively  of our total revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in volume in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially due to two new output programs with major suppliers  which went into effect in january and march  as well as increased volumes and quality of content from some of our existing program suppliers 
these stronger product offerings also resulted in higher order processing fees per unit in fiscal compared to fiscal fees per unit are affected by our mix of units received from program suppliers with varying rates of upfront fees and tend to fluctuate from period to period 
transaction fees decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower rental transactions 
rental transactions at our participating retailers decreased  while the overall rate per transaction decreased by 
rental transactions have declined due to the overall market conditions and the loss of the program supplier noted above 
the rate per transaction has decreased due to the timing and magnitude of guarantees 
the guaranteed rate per unit drives rates up during the first month of the rental cycle 
when there are fewer guarantees or more units reach the second and third months of the rental cycle  rates per transaction decrease 
the increase in transaction fees in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased transactions related to output programs that began during the last quarter of fiscal as discussed above 
rental transactions at our participating retailers increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  while the rate per transaction remained relatively flat 
a portion of the rental transactions were from arrangements which included minimum guarantees 
for fiscal  our rental transaction volume increase of was reduced by rental guarantee transaction fees previously recognized in fiscal  which resulted in the net increase in transactions fees of 
sell through fees decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an overall decrease in the volume of units released 
sell through fees increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher volumes of product available for sale to our participating retailers 
drs fees decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the loss of one major studio customer 
drs revenues increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increases in the number of transactions processed by us and the addition of new customers 

table of contents ami division revenues from our ami division increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal revenues related to our essentials business information service offerings have increased primarily due to our continued investment in  and successful marketing of  these offerings  which has increased our customer base and expanded our service offerings 
other division we did not have any revenues from our other division in fiscal or as supply chain essentials  ondemand essentials and retail essentials moved from the other division to the ami division during the first quarter of fiscal accordingly  revenue related to these products in fiscal was reclassified to the ami division for comparison purposes 
new revenue streams  adessentials and multi screen essentials  are still in development and have not generated any revenue to date 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of order processing costs  transaction costs  sell through costs  handling and freight costs in the ppt division and costs in the ami division associated with certain essentials business information service offerings 
these expenditures represent the direct costs to produce revenues 
in the ppt division  order processing costs  transaction costs and sell through costs represent the amounts due to the program suppliers that hold the distribution rights to the units 
freight costs represent the cost to pick  pack and ship orders of units to the participating retailers 
our cost of sales can also be impacted by the release dates of units with guarantees 
we recognize the guaranteed minimum costs on the release date 
the terms of some of our agreements result in cost of sales on titles in the first month in which the unit is released  which results in lower margins during the initial portion of the revenue sharing period 
once the unit s rental activity exceeds the required amount for these guaranteed minimums  margins generally expand during the second and third months of the unit s revenue sharing period 
however  since these factors are highly dependent upon the quality  timing and release dates of all new products  margins may not expand to any significant degree during any period 
as a result  it is difficult to predict the impact these program supplier revenue sharing programs with guaranteed minimums will have on future results of operations in any reporting period 
in the ami division  a portion of the essentials business information service offerings costs represent costs associated with the operation of a call center for our box office essentials services  as well as costs associated with amortizing capitalized internally developed software used to provide the corresponding services and direct costs incurred to obtain  cleanse and process data and maintain our systems 
cost of sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and increased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in cost of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in revenues discussed above  as well as to the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a shift to more ami division revenue as compared to ppt division revenue 
we achieve higher gross margins on our ami division revenue than on our ppt division revenue 
as revenues increase in our ami division  cost of sales as a percentage of revenues should decrease as most of our costs are fixed 
also  effective april   we increased the estimated lives of our capitalized software to five years from three years based on a review of our previous usage of such internally developed software 
therefore  costs associated with amortizing this software decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents the increase in cost of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the increase in revenues discussed above 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher ppt revenue discussed above and an increase in ami revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  development  marketing and advertising costs  legal and professional fees  communications costs  depreciation and amortization of tangible fixed assets and software  real and personal property leases  as well as other general corporate expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and increased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal selling and administrative expense in fiscal compared to fiscal included an increase of million in stock based compensation related to the issuance of deferred stock units on april  in addition  selling and administrative expense increased million related to the hiring of additional personnel associated with the expansion of our ami division 
these factors were offset by a million decrease in our bonus accrual in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expense increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to the increase in dollars spent in fiscal combined with decreased revenues over which to spread fixed costs 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increases in compensation and related expenses due to expansion of our existing and new lines of business 
in addition  fiscal included million of stock based compensation expense related to stock options and deferred stock units in connection with the implementation of sfas no 
r compared to zero in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expenses were flat at in both fiscal and  as increased revenues over which fixed costs are spread were offset by the increases in expense noted above 
asset impairment during fiscal  we recorded an  impairment charge to write off a component of one of our essentials lines of business  which had been in development 
management concluded that it was likely the asset would not be placed in service in the foreseeable future 
interest income interest income was million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal  and interest income was flat in fiscal compared to fiscal as increases due to higher average cash balances were offset by lower interest rates 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances 
the higher interest rates in fiscal compared to fiscal were due to both higher market rates and the investment of our cash in higher yield investments 
our average combined cash and investment balance was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
other income  net other income  net  in fiscal related to the recognition of the cumulative translation adjustment of our rentrak uk subsidiary 
the subsidiary had remained a legal entity as we were actively pursuing certain business activities

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  significant accounting policies  for additional information 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable by monitoring past due balances 
if it is determined that a customer may be unable to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is established based on the amount we expect to recover 
an additional general reserve is provided based on aging of accounts receivable and our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change related to specific customers  overall aging of accounts receivable or collection experience  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could materially change 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  and  respectively  at march  and program supplier reserves we have entered into guarantee contracts with certain program suppliers providing titles for distribution under our ppt system 
these contracts guarantee the program suppliers minimum payments per unit shipped that are recoupable based on revenue sharing activity 
in some cases  these guarantees are paid in advance 
for amounts not paid in advance  we record a liability for the gross amount of the guarantee due to the program supplier on the street date in accordance with statement of position  accounting by producers or distributors of films sop 
for guarantees paid in advance  the unearned portion of the guarantees is included as advances to program suppliers on our consolidated balance sheets 
using historical experience and year to date rental experience for each title  we estimate the projected revenue to be generated under each guarantee 
we have historically been able to reasonably estimate shortages after to days of rental activity 
we then establish a program supplier reserve for titles that are projected to experience a shortage under the provisions of the guarantee 
the program supplier reserve is netted against advances to program suppliers on our consolidated balance sheets 
we continually review these factors and make adjustments to the reserves as needed 
the balance in this reserve totaled million at both march  and deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and nol carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is unlikely  we will record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
as of march  and  we had a valuation allowance of million recorded against our net operating and capital loss carryforwards in various state and foreign jurisdictions 
net deferred tax assets and liabilities totaled  and  million  respectively  as of march  and landlord incentives we maintain our headquarters in portland  oregon 
on december   we renewed our current lease 
the new lease term began on january  and expires on december  during fiscal  we renovated our headquarter offices and expanded our occupancy from  square feet to approximately  square feet 
this lease was amended to increase our square footage  and  effective february   our leased space will total  square feet 
our lease contains provisions relating to an allowance from our landlord associated with the costs of our improvements  as well as three months of free rent 
these landlord incentives totaled million and million  respectively  at march  and  were recorded as deferred rent and are being amortized at the rate of approximately  per quarter  as a 
table of contents reduction to lease expense over the lease term 
the leasehold improvements are recorded as assets and are included in property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheets 
the leasehold improvements are being depreciated over their economic lives  which are estimated to be years 
capitalized software we account for capitalized software in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
capitalized software  included in property and equipment  net  consists of costs to purchase and develop internal use software  as well as costs to develop internal software which is used by us to provide various services to clients within our expanding essentials suite of services 
these services provide unique data collection  management  analysis and reporting functions  resulting in business information valuable to our clients 
for example  our box office essentials business line reports domestic and international gross receipt theatrical ticket sales to motion picture studios and movie theatre owners 
our ondemand essentials business line measures and reports anonymous video on demand vod usage data to our clients 
such internal and external costs to develop the internal software used to support these services are capitalized after the technological and business feasibility of the project is determined and the preliminary project stage is completed 
we continue to develop our internal software systems in order to expand our service offerings 
once we begin to utilize such software in our products  these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the software 
effective april   we increased the estimated useful life of capitalized software from three to five years based on a review of our previous usage of such internally developed software 
historically  we have been able to utilize the systems we have put in place for a period of at least five years 
capitalized software is reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in technology could affect our estimate of the useful life of such assets 
capitalized software costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million and million at march  and  respectively 
stock based compensation on april   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted to our employees and directors  including employee stock options and deferred stock units dsus based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  we maintained our method of valuation for stock option awards using the black scholes valuation model  which we had used historically for the purpose of providing pro forma financial disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as of march  and  unrecognized stock based compensation related to outstanding  but unvested  options and dsus was million  which will be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period of years 
the use of the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards requires us to make judgments on assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future 
compensation expense is only recognized on awards that ultimately vest 
however  we have not reduced the stock based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures as there is no basis for estimating future forfeitures as most unvested options are held by members of senior management and the board of directors 
we update for forfeitures as they occur and recognize any changes to accumulated compensation expense in the period of change 
if actual forfeitures are significant  our results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents accounting for unrecognized tax benefits in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and applies to situations where there is uncertainty as to the timing of the deduction  the amount of the deduction  or the validity of the deduction 
fin requires that we adjust our financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
as of march   the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million  including penalties and interest of million 
all unrecognized tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if recognized 
new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements 
off balance sheet arrangements other than as disclosed above under contractual payment obligations  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have considered the provisions of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at march  a review of our other financial instruments and risk exposures at march  revealed that we had exposure to interest rate risk related to our cash deposits and marketable securities 
we utilized sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of this risk and concluded that near term changes in interest rates should not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
