item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cost management 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for financial information by geographic area 
sources of supplies although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources  certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers 
we are a major consumer of the world s annual production of tantalum  a metal used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors 
there are currently three major suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder 
we were obligated under contracts with cabot corporation to make purchases of tantalum through these purchase commitments were entered into at a time when market demand for tantalum capacitors was high and tantalum powder was in short supply 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
palladium  a metal used to produce multi layer ceramic capacitors  is currently found primarily in south africa and russia 
palladium is a commodity product that is subject to price volatility 
we periodically enter into short term commitments to purchase palladium 
israeli government incentives we have substantial manufacturing operations in israel  where we benefit from the government s grant and tax incentive programs 
these programs have contributed substantially to our growth and profitability 
for the year ended december   net revenues from products manufactured in israel accounted for approximately of our net revenues 
under the terms of the israeli government s incentive programs  once a project is approved  the recipient is eligible to receive the benefits of the related grants for the life of the project  so long as the recipient continues to meet preset eligibility standards 
none of our approved projects has ever been cancelled  and we have already received approval for a majority of the projects contemplated by our capital expenditure program 
over the past few years  the israeli government has scaled back or discontinued some of its incentive programs 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain our eligibility for existing projects or that in the future the israeli government will continue to offer new incentive programs applicable to us or that  if it does  such programs will provide the same level of benefits we have historically received or that we will continue to be eligible to receive such benefits 
because we have received approvals for most projects currently contemplated  we do not anticipate that cutbacks in the incentive programs for new projects would have an adverse impact on our earnings and operations for at least several years 
we could be materially adversely affected if events were to occur in the middle east that interfered with our operations in israel 
however  we have not experienced any material interruption in our israeli operations during our years of operations there  in spite of several middle east crises  including wars 
inventory and backlog we manufacture both standardized products and those designed and produced to meet customer specifications 
we maintain an inventory of standardized components  and monitor the backlog of outstanding orders for our products 
we include in our backlog only open orders that have been released by the customer for shipment in the next twelve months 
many of our customers encounter uncertain and changing demand for their products 
they typically order products from us based on their forecasts 
if demand falls below customers forecasts  or if customers do not control their inventory effectively  they may cancel or reschedule the shipments included in our backlog  in many instances without the payment of any penalty 
therefore  our backlog at any point in time is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
customers and marketing we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems  electronic manufacturing services ems companies  which manufacture for oems on an outsourcing basis  and independent distributors that maintain large inventories of electronic components for resale to oems 
during  approximately of our sales were to oems  approximately of our sales were to ems companies  and approximately of our sales were to distributors 
to better serve our customers  we maintain production facilities in regions where we market the bulk of our products 
we work with our customers so that our products are incorporated into the design of electronic equipment at the earliest stages of development 
in addition to our staff of direct field sales personnel  independent manufacturers representatives  and distributors  we employ a team of field application and product engineers to assist our customers in solving technical problems and in developing products to meet specific application needs 
our sales organizations are regionally based 
while our sales and support procedures are typically similar across all regions  we remain flexible in our ability to offer programs tailored to our customers specific support requirements in each local area 
the aim of our sales organizations is to support our customers across all product lines  developing new design wins  negotiating pricing and contracts  and providing general commercial support as would normally be expected of a large multi national sales force 
we have established a strategic global account program  which provides each of our top customers with a dedicated strategic global account manager 
vishay strategic global account managers are typically highly experienced salesmen or saleswomen who are capable of providing key customers with the coordination and management visibility required in a complex multi product business relationship 
they typically coordinate the sales  pricing contract  logistic  quality  and other aspects of the customer s business requirements 
the strategic global account manager normally is the focal point of communication between vishay and its main customers 
we maintain a similar program for our strategic distributors as well 
we also seek to meet the needs of our customers for technical and applications support 
vishay s business development group maintains teams of dedicated field application engineers faes in the field for the exclusive support of our customers engineering needs 
organized by market segment  our business development faes bring specific knowledge of component applications in their areas of expertise in the automotive  telecommunications  computer  consumer entertainment  industrial  peripherals  digital consumer  and other market segments 
with the ultimate goal of a vishay design in the process by which our customers specify a vishay component in their products this program offers our customers superior access to vishay technologies while at the same time increasing design wins  and ultimately sales  for vishay 
most importantly  the process is closely monitored via a proprietary database developed by the vishay business development group 
our database captures very specific design activity and allows for real time measurement of new business potential for our management team 
our top customers have been quite stable despite not having long term commitments to purchase our products 
with selected customers  we have signed longer term greater than one year contracts for specific products 
net revenues from our top customers represent approximately of our total net revenues 
no single customer comprises more than of our total net revenues 
during  approximately of our net revenues were attributable to customers in the americas  approximately were attributable to customers in europe  and approximately were attributable to customers in asia 
during  the share of net revenues by end use market was as follows industrial   computer   automotive   consumer products   telecommunications   military and aerospace   medical  
competition we face strong competition in various product lines from both domestic and foreign manufacturers that produce products using technologies similar to ours 
our primary competitors by product type include discrete devices fairchild semiconductor  international rectifier  infineon  on semiconductor  nxp semiconductors  rohm  stmicroelectronics  toshiba 
integrated circuits fairchild semiconductor  international rectifier  infineon  maxim  on semiconductor  stmicroelectronics 
optoelectronics avago  fairchild semiconductor  sharp  toshiba 
resistors and inductors epcos  koa  rohm  yageo 
capacitors avx  epcos  kemet  murata  tdk  yageo 
measurements group various niche competitors 
there are many other companies that produce products in the markets in which we compete 
our competitive position depends on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage on the basis of product quality  know how  proprietary data  market knowledge  service capability  business reputation  and price competitiveness 
our sales and marketing programs aim to offer our customers a broad range of world class technologies  superior global sales and distribution support  and a secure and multi location source of product supply 
research and development many of our products and manufacturing techniques  technologies  and packaging methods have been invented  designed  and developed by our engineers and scientists 
we maintain strategically placed design centers where proximity to customers enables us to more easily gauge and satisfy the needs of local markets 
these design centers are located predominantly in the united states  germany  israel  the people s republic of china  france  the republic of china taiwan  south korea  the united kingdom  and canada 
we also maintain research and development staffs and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products  and to improve manufacturing techniques 
this decentralized system encourages individual product development at individual manufacturing facilities that occasionally has applications at other facilities 
our research and development efforts over the past few years have been largely focused on our semiconductors segment  principally for the development of new power products and power ics 
we also have research and development programs that should enhance our efforts in vertical integration of our product lines  combining vishay components in packages 
examples of these packages include combinations of our sensors and our radio frequency technology to create wireless transducers  wireless precision potentiometers  and other new products 
patents and licenses we have made a significant investment in securing intellectual property protection for our technology and products 
we seek to protect our technology by  among other things  filing patent applications for technology considered important to the development of our business 
we also rely upon trade secrets  unpatented know how  continuing technological innovation  and the aggressive pursuit of licensing opportunities to help develop and maintain our competitive position 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends  in part  on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
although we have been awarded  have filed applications for  or have been licensed under  numerous patents in the united states and other countries  there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued 
we require all of our technical  research and development  sales and marketing  and management employees and most consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us 
these agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the entity or individual during the course of the entity s or individual s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances 
substantially all of our technical  research and development  sales and marketing  and management employees have entered into agreements providing for the assignment to us of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us 
when we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights  we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action  and we intend to continue to do so 
see item  legal proceedings 
although we have numerous united states and foreign patents covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes  no particular patent is considered individually material to our business 
environment  health and safety we have adopted an environmental health and safety corporate policy that commits us to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws  to promote proper management of hazardous materials for the safety of our employees and the protection of the environment  and to minimize the hazardous materials generated in the course of our operations 
this policy is implemented with accountability directly to the board of directors 
in addition  our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal  state  and local laws restricting discharge of materials into the environment 
vishay is involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by vishay and its subsidiaries  in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party prp at three superfund sites 
certain obligations as a prp have arisen in connection with business acquisitions 
the remediation programs are on going at four currently operating us facilities  nine currently operating non us facilities  six formerly owned non us sites  and one formerly owned non us site 
the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup  the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 
see item  legal proceedings 
we are not involved in any pending or threatened proceedings that would require curtailment of our operations 
we continually expend funds to ensure that our facilities comply with applicable environmental regulations 
while we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws  we cannot accurately predict future developments and do not necessarily have knowledge of all past occurrences on sites that we currently occupy 
more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future  and we cannot determine the modifications  if any  in our operations that any such future regulations might require  or the cost of compliance with such regulations 
moreover  the risk of environmental liability and remediation costs is inherent in the nature of our business and  therefore  there can be no assurance that material environmental costs  including remediation costs  will not arise in the future 
with each acquisition  we attempt to identify potential environmental concerns and to minimize  or obtain indemnification for  the environmental matters we may be required to address 
in addition  we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities 
we believe that the reserves we have established are adequate 
nevertheless  we often unavoidably inherit certain pre existing environmental liabilities  generally based on successor liability doctrines 
although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations  there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  full time employees  of whom approximately were located outside the united states 
our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and administrative personnel 
some of our employees outside the united states are members of trade unions  and employees at one small us facility are represented by a union 
our relationship with our employees is generally good 
however  no assurance can be given that  if we continue to restructure our operations in response to changing economic conditions  labor unrest or strikes will not occur

risk factors from time to time  information provided by us  including but not limited to statements in this report  or other statements made by or on our behalf  may contain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties  and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control  which may cause actual results  performance  or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated 
set forth below are important factors that could cause our results  performance  or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf factors relating to our business generally our business is cyclical and the periods of decline in demand that we have experienced in the past may resume and may become more pronounced 
the electronic component and semiconductor industries are highly cyclical and experience periods of decline from time to time 
we and others in the electronic and semiconductor component industry have experienced these conditions in the recent past and cannot predict when we may experience such downturns in the future 
a decline in product demand on a global basis could result in order cancellations and deferrals  lower average selling prices  and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations 
these declines in demand are driven by market conditions in the end use markets for our products 
changes in the demand mix  needed technologies  and these end use markets may adversely affect our ability to match our products  inventory  and capacity to meet customer demand and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the prospect of a slowdown in demand or recessionary trends in the global economy makes it more difficult for us to predict our future sales and manage our operations  and could adversely impact our results of operations 
we have incurred and may continue to incur restructuring costs and associated asset write downs 
to remain competitive  particularly when business conditions are difficult  we attempt to reduce our cost structure through restructuring activities 
this includes acquisition related restructuring  where we attempt to streamline the operations of companies we acquire and achieve synergies between our acquisitions and our existing businesses 
it also includes restructuring our existing businesses  where we seek to eliminate redundant facilities and staff positions and move operations  where possible  to jurisdictions with lower labor costs 
we recorded restructuring and severance costs  plus related asset write downs  in each of       and  and we expect to incur such expenses during in the past we have grown through successful integration of acquired businesses  but this may not continue 
our long term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future 
we also cannot assure you that acquisitions that we have recently completed or will complete in the future will be successful 
if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses  our results of operations  enterprise value  market value  and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected 
our debt levels and the august  put option related to our convertible subordinated notes could adversely affect the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition 
at december   we had approximately million of debt outstanding 
of this amount  million represents our convertible subordinated notes due the holders of these notes have the right to require us to repurchase these notes on august  and other specified future dates at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes million 
if these notes are put to us in august  we intend to utilize our revolving credit facility or a replacement debt instrument to fund the purchase 
pursuant to the indenture governing the notes  we have the right to pay the purchase price for the notes in cash  vishay common stock  or a combination of both 
in june  our board of directors adopted a resolution pursuant to which we intend to waive our rights to settle the principal amount of the notes in shares of vishay common stock 
in accordance with the resolution of our board  if notes are tendered for repurchase  we will pay the repurchase price in cash 
the marketplace could react negatively to our current debt levels and the possibility that we will need to repurchase the convertible subordinated debt in the near future  which in turn could affect our share price and also make it more difficult for us to obtain financing in the future 
to remain successful  we must continue to innovate  and our investments in new technologies may not prove successful 
our future operating results are dependent on our ability to continually develop  introduce  and market new and innovative products  to modify existing products  to respond to technological change  and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements 
there are numerous risks inherent in this process  including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands 
if this occurs  we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to our own research and development initiatives  we periodically invest in technology start up enterprises  in which we may acquire a controlling or noncontrolling interest but whose technology would be available to be commercialized by us 
there are numerous risks in investments of this nature including the limited operating history of such start up entities  their need for capital  and their limited or absence of production experience  as well as the risk that their technologies may prove ineffective or fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace 
there can be no assurance  therefore  that our investments in start up enterprises will prove successful 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends  in part  on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
protection of intellectual property often involves complex legal and factual issues 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we have applied  and will continue to apply  for patents covering our technologies and products  as we deem appropriate 
however  our applications may not result in issued patents 
also  our existing patents and any future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies  design around our patented technologies  or may challenge or seek to invalidate our patents 
the electronic components industry  particularly the discrete semiconductor sector  is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we have on occasion been notified that we may be infringing patent and other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  customers purchasing components from us have rights to indemnification under certain circumstances if such components violate the intellectual property rights of others 
further  we have observed that in the current electronic component and semiconductor industries business environment  companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors 
we will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  and may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing 
although licenses are generally offered in such situations and we have successfully resolved these situations in the past  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement  or that we will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms 
an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
future acquisitions could require us to issue additional indebtedness or equity 
if we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash  the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt 
this acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria 
under our existing credit facility  we are required to obtain the lenders consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants including the application of specific financial ratios 
we are also restricted from paying cash dividends on our capital stock 
we cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required 
if we were to undertake an acquisition for equity  the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock 
our results are sensitive to raw material availability  quality  and cost 
many of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials  the quality of available raw materials deteriorates  or there are significant price increases for these raw materials 
for periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising  we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers  which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used 
for periods in which the prices are declining  we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials  since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost  this write down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 
from time to time there have been short term market shortages of raw materials 
while these shortages have not historically adversely affected our ability to increase production of products containing these materials  they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for us 
we cannot assure you that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect our ability to increase production  particularly during periods of growing demand for our products 
also  to assure availability of raw materials in time of shortage  we may enter into long term supply contracts for these materials  which may prove unnecessary and burdensome when the shortage abates 
our backlog is subject to customer cancellation 
many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty 
our customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when backlog is particularly long 
they often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive  a situation that we have experienced during periods of economic slowdown 
therefore  we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog does not exceed the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered 
our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog 
we face intense competition in our business  and we market our products to an increasingly concentrated group of customers 
our business is highly competitive worldwide  with low transportation costs and few import barriers 
we compete principally on the bases of product quality and reliability  availability  customer service  technological innovation  timely delivery  and price 
the electronic component industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors  some of which are larger than us  have significant financial resources and technological capabilities 
our customers have become increasingly concentrated in recent years  and as a result  their buying power has increased and they have had greater ability to negotiate favorable pricing 
this trend has adversely affected our average selling prices  particularly for commodity components 
we may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products 
our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy  we may experience intense demand for our products 
during such periods  we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing to satisfy demand 
factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment  shortages of skilled personnel  and physical constraints on expansion at our facilities 
if we are unable to meet our customers requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production  we could lose customers and or market share 
these losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
also  capacity that we add during upturns in the business cycle may result in excess capacity during periods when demand for our products recede  resulting in inefficient use of capital which could also adversely affect us 
future changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase costs 
our manufacturing operations  products and or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances  wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes  employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes  products or packaging  restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging  and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging 
we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities which we believe are adequate 
nevertheless  we often unavoidably inherit certain pre existing environmental liabilities  generally based on successor liability doctrines 
although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations  there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
in addition  more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future  and we cannot presently determine the modifications  if any  in our operations that any such future regulations might require  or the cost of compliance with these regulations 
in order to resolve liabilities at various sites  we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees  some of which may be  under certain conditions  reopened or subject to renegotiation 
our products may experience a reduction in product classification levels under various military specifications 
we have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications approved and monitored by the united states defense electronic supply center  and under certain european military specifications 
these products are assigned certain classification levels 
in order to maintain the classification level of a product  we must continuously perform tests on the product and the results of these tests must be reported to governmental agencies 
if any of our products fails to meet the requirements of the applicable classification level  that product s classification may be reduced to a lower level 
a decrease in the classification level for any of our products with a military application could have an adverse impact on the net revenues and earnings attributable to that product 
our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  managerial  marketing  finance  and administrative personnel 
rapid changes in technologies  frequent new product introductions  and declining average selling prices over product life cycles require us to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop technological innovations and bring them to market on a timely basis 
our complex operations also require us to attract and retain highly qualified administrative personnel in functions such as legal  tax  accounting  financial reporting  auditing  and treasury 
the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive 
while we have employment agreements with five of our executives  we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel 
the loss of the services of or the failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
factors relating to vishay s operations outside the united states we obtain substantial benefits by operating in israel  but these benefits may not continue 
we have increased our operations in israel over the past several years 
the low tax rates in israel applicable to earnings of our operations in that country  compared to the rates in the united states  have had the general effect of increasing our net earnings  although this was not the case during   and due to losses on purchase commitments 
also  we have benefited from employment incentive grants made by the israeli government 
there can also be no assurance that in the future the israeli government will continue to offer new grant and tax incentive programs applicable to us or that  if it does  such programs will provide the same level of benefits we have historically received or that we will continue to be eligible to benefit from them 
any significant increase in the israeli tax rates or reduction or elimination of the israeli grant programs that have benefited us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we attempt to improve profitability by operating in countries in which labor costs are low  but the shift of operations to these regions may entail considerable expense 
our strategy is aimed at achieving significant production cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to and in countries with lower production costs  such as the czech republic  india  israel  malaysia  mexico  the people s republic of china  and the philippines 
during this process  we may experience under utilization of certain plants and factories in high labor cost regions and capacity constraints in plants and factories located in low labor cost regions 
this under utilization may result initially in production inefficiencies and higher costs 
these costs include those associated with compensation in connection with work force reductions and plant closings in the higher labor cost regions  and start up expenses  manufacturing and construction delays  and increased depreciation costs in connection with the initiation or expansion of production in lower labor cost regions 
in addition  as we implement transfers of certain of our operations we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay offs or termination of our employees in high labor cost countries 
we are subject to the risks of political  economic  and military instability in countries outside the united states in which we operate 
we have operations outside the united states  and approximately of our revenues during were derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
some of the countries in which we operate have in the past experienced and may continue to experience political  economic  and military instability or unrest 
these conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and  depending on the extent and severity of these conditions  could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition and operating results 
we have never experienced any material interruption in our israeli operations in our years of operations there  in spite of several middle east crises  including wars 
however  we might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the middle east that interfered with our operations in israel 
factors related to vishay s capital structure the holders of class b common stock have effective voting control of vishay 
vishay has two classes of common stock common stock and class b common stock 
the holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held  while the holders of class b common stock are entitled to votes for each share held 
currently  the holders of class b common stock hold approximately of the voting power of vishay 
directly  through a family trust  and as voting trustee under a voting trust agreement  dr 
felix zandman  executive chairman and chief technical and business development officer of vishay  has sole or shared voting power over substantially all of the outstanding class b common stock 
as a result  the holders of class b common stock effectively cause the election of directors and approve other actions as stockholders without the approval of other stockholders of vishay 
vishay has a staggered board of directors which could make a takeover of vishay difficult 
vishay s staggered board of directors might discourage  delay  or prevent a change in control of vishay by a third party and could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
also  as a consequence of vishay s staggered board  directors may not be removed without cause  even though a majority of stockholders may wish to do so 
our reluctance to issue substantial additional shares in order not to dilute the interests of our existing stockholders could impede growth 
in the past  vishay has grown through numerous acquisitions financed alternatively through cash on hand  the incurrence of indebtedness  and the issuance of equity  directly or indirectly by refinancing acquisition debt 
we may in the future be presented with attractive investment or strategic opportunities that  because of their size and the financial condition of vishay at the time  would require the issuance of substantial additional amounts of our common stock 
if such opportunities were to arise  our board of directors would need to consider the potentially dilutive effect on the interests and voting power of our existing stockholders 
in particular  our board of directors believes that it is in our best interest to ensure the continued vision and influence of our founder  dr 
felix zandman  over our corporate affairs 
dr 
zandman currently has effective voting control over vishay through our class b common stock  by direct ownership  a family trust  and a voting trust agreement  such that he has approximately of our outstanding voting power 
the reluctance to issue additional shares could impede our future growth 
general economic and business factors in addition to the factors relating specifically to our business  a variety of other factors relating to general conditions could cause actual results  performance  or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements 
these factors include overall economic and business conditions  competitive factors in the industries in which we conduct our business  changes in governmental regulation  changes in tax requirements  including tax rate changes  new tax laws  and revised tax law interpretations  changes in generally accepted accounting principles or interpretations of those principles by governmental agencies and self regulatory groups  interest rate fluctuations  foreign currency rate fluctuations  and other capital market conditions  and economic and political conditions in international markets  including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders 
our common stock  traded on the new york stock exchange  has in the past experienced  and may continue to experience  significant fluctuations in price and volume 
we believe that the financial performance and activities of other publicly traded companies in the electronic component and semiconductor industries could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially without regard to our operating performance 
we operate in a continually changing business environment  and new factors emerge from time to time 
other unknown and unpredictable factors also could have a material adverse effect on our future results  performance  or financial condition

item legal proceedings from time to time we are involved in routine litigation incidental to our business 
management believes that such matters  either individually or in the aggregate  should not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
intellectual property matters we are engaged in discussions with various parties regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing issues 
in addition  we have observed that in the current electronic component and semiconductor industry business environment  companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors 
we will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  and we may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing 
an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
when we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights  we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action  and we intend to continue to do so 
during the past few years  we settled several suits which we had initiated to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we are receiving royalties on sales of these companies products which use our technology 
we presently have other pending legal actions that we have initiated against companies which we believe are misappropriating our intellectual property rights 
siliconix stockholder matters proctor litigation in january  an amended class action complaint was filed in the superior court of california on behalf of all non vishay stockholders of siliconix against vishay  ernst young llp the independent registered public accounting firm that audits the company s financial statements  dr 
felix zandman  executive chairman and chief technical and business development officer of vishay  and as a nominal defendant  siliconix 
the suit made various claims against vishay and the other defendants for actions allegedly taken in respect of siliconix during the period when vishay owned an interest in siliconix 
the action sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages 
in may  vishay successfully completed a tender offer to acquire all shares of siliconix that were not already owned by vishay 
following the announcement of vishay s intent to make this tender offer  several purported class action complaints were filed in the delaware court of chancery 
these actions were consolidated into a single class action and a settlement agreement was reached with the plaintiffs  who effectively represented all non vishay stockholders of siliconix 
the settlement agreement was approved by the delaware court of chancery in october the proctor plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in the superior court of california in november in june  the delaware court of chancery issued a permanent injunction restraining the proctor plaintiffs from prosecuting the proctor action 
an appeal of the injunction order brought by a former stockholder of siliconix was dismissed by the delaware supreme court in january also in june  the proctor litigation was removed from the superior court of california to federal district court there 
the district court granted a motion by ernst young to dismiss the complaint and a motion by vishay for summary judgment  effective october  the proctor plaintiffs thereafter filed a notice of appeal to the ninth circuit court of appeals  which is pending 
environmental matters vishay is involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by vishay and its subsidiaries  in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party prp at three superfund sites 
certain obligations as a prp have arisen in connection with business acquisitions 
the remediation programs are on going at four currently operating us facilities  nine currently operating non us facilities  six formerly owned non us sites  and one formerly owned non us site 
the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup  the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations  and alternative cleanup methods

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview vishay intertechnology  inc is an international manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors and passive electronic components  including power mosfets  power conversion and motor control integrated circuits  transistors  diodes  optoelectronic components  resistors  capacitors  inductors  strain gages  load cells  force measurement sensors  displacement sensors  and photoelastic sensors 
semiconductors and electronic components manufactured by vishay are used in virtually all types of electronic products  including those in the industrial  computer  automotive  consumer electronic products  telecommunications  military aerospace  and medical industries 
vishay operates in two segments  semiconductors and passive components 
semiconductors segment products include transistors  diodes  rectifiers  certain types of integrated circuits  and optoelectronic products 
passive components segment products include resistors  capacitors  and inductors 
we include in the passive components segment our measurements group  which manufactures and markets strain gages  load cells  transducers  instruments  and weighing systems whose core components are resistors that are sensitive to various types of mechanical stress 
while the passive components business had historically predominated at vishay  following several acquisitions of semiconductor businesses  revenues from our semiconductors and passive components segments were essentially split evenly from through the first quarter of on april   vishay acquired the power control systems pcs business of international rectifier corporation  which has been included in the semiconductors segment 
going forward  revenues from our semiconductors segment are expected to represent slightly more than half of our total revenues 
net revenues for the year ended december  were billion  compared to net revenues of billion for the year ended december  income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings of million or per diluted share for the year ended december  vishay intends to sell the automotive modules and subsystems business unit asbu acquired on april  as part of the pcs business 
the operations of the asbu have been classified as discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations in was million  resulting in net earnings of million  or per diluted share 
income from continuing operations for the year ended december  of million  or per diluted share  was impacted by pretax charges for restructuring and severance costs of million  related asset write downs of million  and a contract termination charge of million  net of a gain on sale of a building of million 
these items and their tax related consequences  plus additional tax expense for changes in uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances totaling million  had a negative per share effect on income from continuing operations 
earnings for the year ended december  were impacted by restructuring and severance costs of million  related asset write downs of million  write downs and write offs of tantalum inventories totaling million  losses resulting from adjustments to previously existing purchase commitments of million  a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million  an adjustment to increase the estimated cost of environmental remediation obligations associated with the general semiconductor acquisition of million  and charges totaling million to settle past product quality issues 
these items and their tax related consequences had a negative effect on earnings per share 
the business environment during continued to be relatively friendly  continuing the business climate enjoyed by the electronic components industry since the fourth quarter of for the second year in a row  in we recognized the highest annual revenues in our history 
financial metrics we utilize several financial measures and metrics to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business 
these key financial measures and metrics include net revenues  gross profit margin  end of period backlog  and the book to bill ratio 
we also monitor changes in inventory turnover and average selling prices asp 
gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of net revenues 
gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold  but also deducts certain other period costs  particularly losses on purchase commitments and inventory write downs 
losses on purchase commitments and inventory write downs have the impact of reducing gross profit margin in the period of the charge  but result in improved gross profit margins in subsequent periods by reducing costs of products sold as inventory is used 
gross profit margin is clearly a function of net revenues  but also reflects our cost cutting programs and our ability to contain fixed costs 
end of period backlog is one indicator of future revenues 
we include in our backlog only open orders that have been released by the customer for shipment in the next twelve months 
if demand falls below customers forecasts  or if customers do not control their inventory effectively  they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog  in many instances without the payment of any penalty 
therefore  the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
another important indicator of demand in our industry is the book to bill ratio  which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period 
a book to bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our backlog is building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods 
conversely  a book to bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining revenues 
we focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory 
we define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our costs of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory computed using each quarter end balance for this same period 
the inventory balance used for computation of this ratio includes tantalum inventories in excess of one year supply  which are classified as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
a higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital 
pricing in our industry can be volatile 
we analyze trends and changes in average selling prices to evaluate likely future pricing 
the erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the industry 
however  we attempt to offset this deterioration with ongoing cost reduction activities and new product introductions  as newer products typically yield larger gross margins 
the quarter to quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business 
the following table shows net revenues  gross profit margin  the end of period backlog  the book to bill ratio  the inventory turnover  and changes in asp for our business as a whole during the five quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of and through the fourth quarter of dollars in thousands th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter net revenues    gross profit margin end of period backlog     book to bill ratio inventory turnover change in asp vs 
prior quarter the significant sequential increase in net revenues during the second quarter of is primarily attributable to million of revenue from the pcs business and pm group acquired during that quarter 
for comparison  net revenues of these acquired businesses in the third and fourth quarters of were million and million  respectively 
gross profit margin includes the impact of inventory write downs and write offs and gain loss on purchase commitments 
the significant sequential increase in end of period backlog during the second quarter of is primarily attributable to million of backlog of the pcs business and pm group  as of their respective dates of acquisition 
see financial metrics by segment below for net revenues  book to bill ratio  and gross profit margin broken out by segment 
although the fourth quarter turned out to be unsatisfactory from an earnings perspective  we continued to experience relatively favorable economic conditions during revenues for the fourth quarter of were approximately the same as revenues for the third quarter of and were in our expected range 
the book to bill ratio decreased slightly to 
for the fourth quarter of  the book to bill ratios for distribution customers and original equipment manufacturers oem were and  respectively  versus ratios of and  respectively  during the third quarter of we expect revenues between million and million for the first quarter of  with improved margins 
continuing the trend experienced in  we experienced relatively moderate pressure on pricing during we anticipate increasing pricing pressure in financial metrics by segment the following table shows net revenues  book to bill ratio  and gross profit margin broken out by segment for the five quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of dollars in thousands th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter semiconductors net revenues     book to bill ratio gross profit margin passive components net revenues      book to bill ratio gross profit margin the significant sequential increase in net revenues for the semiconductors segment during the second quarter of is primarily attributable to million of revenue from the pcs business acquired during that quarter

gross profit margin for the passive components segment includes the impact of inventory write downs and write offs and gain loss on purchase commitments 
acquisition and divestiture activity as part of our growth strategy  we seek to expand through acquisition of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets  reputations for product quality and reliability  and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise 
this includes exploring opportunities to acquire smaller targets to gain market share  effectively penetrate different geographic markets  enhance new product development  round out our product lines  or grow our high margin niche market businesses 
also as part of this growth strategy  we seek to explore opportunities with privately held developers of electronic components  whether through acquisition  investment in noncontrolling interests  or strategic alliances 
we completed two strategic acquisitions in and one strategic acquisition in during  we completed three strategic acquisitions and also acquired the interest in siliconix that we did not already own 
we also divested or plan to divest certain non core businesses acquired in these transactions 
activities on april   we acquired the pcs business of international rectifier corporation for approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired 
the acquired product lines  which complement our existing product portfolio  consist of planar high voltage mosfets  schottky diodes  diode rectifiers  fast recovery diodes  high power diodes and thyristors  power modules a combination of power diodes  thyristors  mosfets  and igbts  and automotive modules and subassemblies 
the extension of vishay s product offerings in the high voltage and high power range for discrete semiconductors represents another step in vishay s successful strategy of being able to offer one stop shop service for discrete electronic components 
on july   we formally announced our intent to sell the automotive modules and subsystems business unit acquired as part of the pcs acquisition 
the acquisition includes a wafer fab in torino  italy  as well as facilities in mumbai  india and xi an  china 
at this time  vishay has no plans for extensive restructuring 
vishay and international rectifier entered into several transition services agreements for information technology  logistics  and other functions  as well as for the supply of wafers for up to three years 
we believe that the acquisition has the potential to materially improve our growth in revenues  return on investment  and profits 
we believe the new product lines are a favorable complement to our existing product lines 
we have successfully integrated the acquired product groups into vishay s existing organization  and this business is presently operating at the expected annual run rate of million in revenues 
while the acquired business was accretive to  the profitability thus far has been below expectations 
we believe there are several areas for improvement which will be completed in steps in as contemplated under our transition agreements with international rectifier  by mid we will transfer about of front end and back end production out of facilities retained by international rectifier  resulting in cost reductions 
on april   we declared our cash tender offer for all shares of pm group plc wholly unconditional  and assumed ownership of pm group 
pm group is an advanced designer and manufacturer of systems used in the weighing and process control industries  located in the united kingdom 
the aggregate cash paid for all shares of pm group was approximately million 
the transaction was funded using cash on hand 
we immediately sold pm group s electrical contracting subsidiary for approximately million 
activities effective july   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of phoenix do brasil ltda  a manufacturer of resistors  for approximately million 
the acquisition of phoenix do brasil provides vishay with increased market presence in south america 
activities on april   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of si technologies  inc  a designer  manufacturer  and marketer of high performance industrial sensors and controls  weighing and automotive systems  and related products 
the purchase price was million in cash  plus the assumption of million of si technologies debt  of which we caused million to be repaid subsequent to closing 
the remaining outstanding amounts on the short term revolving credit facility of si technologies european subsidiary were repaid during the third quarter of on october   we sold aerogo  inc  si technologies subsidiary engaged in the design  manufacture  and marketing of industrial automation products  for approximately million 
no gain or loss was recognized on the sale of aerogo 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed two niche acquisitions 
on october   we acquired the assets of cyoptics israel  ltd  which will initially be utilized primarily as a research and development facility 
on november   we acquired alpha electronics kk  a japanese manufacturer of foil resistors 
the purchase price for these two acquisitions was approximately million  plus assumption of approximately million of debt 
minority interest in siliconix on may   we completed an offer to exchange shares of vishay common stock for shares of siliconix stock that we did not already own 
each siliconix share tendered was exchanged for shares of vishay common stock  with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares of vishay 
prior to the exchange offer  vishay owned approximately of the common stock of siliconix 
following the completion of the exchange offer  vishay s ownership increased to approximately of the common stock of siliconix  which was above the threshold necessary to effect a merger without a vote of stockholders 
on may   vishay effected a merger of a subsidiary of vishay with and into siliconix  as a result of which siliconix became a wholly owned subsidiary of vishay 
in the merger  each share of siliconix stock  other than those owned by vishay and its subsidiaries  was converted into shares of vishay common stock  subject to the right of siliconix s remaining stockholders to seek appraisal under delaware law 
cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares of vishay 
as a controlled majority owned subsidiary  the results of operations of siliconix were included in our consolidated financial statements prior to the acquisition of the minority interest  and the outside stockholders interests were shown as minority interest on the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated balance sheets 
the acquisition of the minority interest in siliconix contributed approximately million  million  and million incrementally to our earnings for   and  respectively 
following the announcement of our intention to make the tender offer for the remaining shares of siliconix that we did not already own  several purported class action complaints were filed against vishay  siliconix  and the siliconix directors  alleging  among other things  that the intended offer was unfair and a breach of fiduciary duty  and seeking  among other things  to enjoin the transaction 
both vishay and siliconix incurred expenses associated with the defense of the stockholder litigation described above and the subsequent settlement 
additionally  siliconix incurred expenses related to the exchange offer  including costs of the special committee of independent siliconix directors appointed to evaluate the offer and the costs of the special committee s financial and legal advisors 
these costs do not represent vishay s direct costs of the acquisition  and accordingly are not included in the purchase price 
these costs  aggregating million  are included in a separate line item in the consolidated statement of operations 
purchased in process research and development represents the value assigned in a business combination to research and development projects of the acquired business that were commenced  but not completed  at the date of acquisition  for which technological feasibility has not been established  and which have no alternative future use in research and development activities or otherwise 
amounts assigned to purchased in process research and development meeting the above criteria must be charged to expense at the date of consummation of the business combination 
a charge of million was recorded in the second quarter of  equal to approximately of the value of siliconix in process research and development at the time of the acquisition of the minority interest 
a charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of related to purchased in process research and development associated with the alpha electronics kk transaction 
cost management we place a strong emphasis on reducing our costs 
since  we have been implementing aggressive cost reduction programs to enhance our competitiveness  particularly in light of the erosion of average selling prices of established products that is typical of the industry 
our cost savings initiatives generally include a combination of production transfers  plant closures  and overhead streamlining 
one way we have reduced costs is by moving production to the extent possible from high labor cost markets  such as the united states and western europe  to lower labor cost markets  such as the czech republic  israel  india  malaysia  mexico  the people s republic of china  and the philippines 
the percentage of our total headcount in lower labor cost countries is a measure of the extent to which we are successful in implementing this program 
this percentage was excluding businesses acquired in at the end of  at the end of  at the end of  and when this program began in our long term target is to have between and of our headcount in lower labor cost countries 
these production transfers and other long term cost cutting measures require us to initially incur significant severance and other exit costs and to record losses on excess buildings and equipment 
we anticipate that we will realize the benefits of our restructuring through lower labor costs and other operating expenses in future periods 
between and  we recorded million of restructuring and severance costs and recorded related asset write downs of million in order to reduce our cost structure going forward 
we have realized  and expect to continue to realize  annual net cost savings associated with these restructuring activities 
restructuring and severance costs  as presented on the consolidated statement of operations  are separate from plant closure  employee termination and similar integration costs we incur in connection with our acquisition activities 
these plant closure and employee termination costs subsequent to acquisitions are also integral to our cost reduction program 
these amounts  which were not significant in   and  are included in the costs of our acquisitions and do not affect earnings or losses on our statement of operations 
we evaluate potential restructuring projects based on an expected payback period 
the payback period represents the number of years of annual cost savings necessary to recover the initial cash outlay for severance and other exit costs plus the non cash expenses recognized for asset write downs 
in general  a restructuring project must have a payback of less than years to be considered beneficial 
on average  our restructuring projects have a payback of between and years 
during and the first quarter of  we completed a broad based fixed cost reduction program 
in april  we began evaluating additional restructuring initiatives to improve the results of underperforming divisions 
annual pretax savings resulting from restructuring projects initiated under these programs were expected to be approximately million  of which approximately of the savings would reduce costs of products sold  and approximately of the savings would result in reduced selling  general  and administrative costs 
our actual costs savings from these programs in were approximately million 
of this million of annualized savings  approximately million began to be realized in  and million began to be realized in we expect to begin to realize an additional million of savings from these programs in the expected and actual savings quantified above are net of additional costs incurred after production was transferred to lower labor cost regions 
we expect these restructuring programs to result in higher profitability through better gross margins and lower selling  general  and administrative expenses 
however  these programs to improve our profitability also involve certain risks which could materially impact our future operating results  as further detailed in item a  risk factors 
while we expect some restructuring projects in  we believe that we are in the final phase of the major restructuring efforts that have been on going since our restructuring projects for included moving certain back end semiconductor production from the republic of china taiwan to the people s republic of china  shifting of production for certain product lines from belgium to india and the people s republic of china  completing the shift of production for a portion of our aluminum capacitor product lines from the netherlands to austria and or sub contractors  and other miscellaneous projects 
while streamlining and reducing fixed overhead  we are exercising caution so that we will not negatively impact our customer service or our ability to further develop products and processes 
our cost management plans also include expansion of certain critical capacities  which we hope will reduce average materials and processing costs 
israeli government incentives we have substantial manufacturing operations in israel  where we benefit from the government s grants and tax incentive programs 
these benefits take the form of government grants and reduced tax rates that are lower than those in the united states 
israeli government grants are awarded to specific projects 
these grants are intended to promote employment in israel s industrial sector and are conditioned on the recipient maintaining certain prescribed employment levels 
grants are paid when the related projects are approved by the israeli government and become operational 
israeli government grants  recorded as a reduction in the costs of products sold  were million  million  and million  in   and  respectively 
at december   our consolidated balance sheet reflected million in deferred grant income 
under the terms of the israeli government s incentive programs  once a project is approved  the recipient is eligible to receive the benefits of the related grants for the life of the project  so long as the recipient continues to meet preset eligibility standards 
none of our approved projects has ever been cancelled  and we have already received approval for a majority of the projects contemplated by our capital expenditure program 
over the past few years  the israeli government has scaled back or discontinued some of its incentive programs 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain our eligibility for existing projects or that in the future the israeli government will continue to offer new incentive programs applicable to us or that  if it does  such programs will provide the same level of benefits we have historically received or that we will continue to be eligible to receive such benefits 
because we have received approvals for most projects currently contemplated  we do not anticipate that cutbacks in the incentive programs for new projects would have an adverse impact on our earnings and operations for at least several years 
write downs of tantalum inventory and purchase commitments we are a major consumer of the world s annual production of tantalum 
tantalum  a metal purchased in powder or wire form  is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors 
there are currently three major suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder 
we were obligated under two contracts entered into in with cabot corporation to make purchases of tantalum through as of december   we have fulfilled all obligations under the cabot contracts and are no longer required to purchase tantalum from cabot at these fixed prices 
the cabot contracts were entered into at a time when market demand for tantalum capacitors was high and tantalum powder was in short supply 
since that time  as a result of a general downturn in the electronics business  we experienced a significant decrease in capacitor sales and the price of tantalum decreased significantly 
accordingly  we wrote down the carrying value of our tantalum inventory on hand and recognized losses on purchase commitments 
during the term of the contracts with cabot  we regularly reviewed our liability for purchase commitments 
our liability for purchase commitments was estimated based on contractually obligated purchase prices  expected market prices  and the contractually obligated mix of tantalum grades to be purchased 
the mix of tantalum grades to be purchased is within a range specified in the contracts 
changes in expected market prices and in our mix of tantalum grade purchases required us to record additional gains or losses on its purchase commitments 
during the term of the contracts  we recorded the following charges related to our tantalum contracts in thousands loss gain write downs on purchase of inventory commitments on hand the loss on purchase commitments recorded during was due to a decline in market prices for tantalum  as well as changes in the mix of tantalum grade purchases 
of the total amount recorded  approximately million was attributable to the decline in market value  while another million was attributable to changes in the mix of tantalum grade purchases 
the net gain on purchase commitments recorded during was attributable to a conditional price reduction included in one of our contracts with cabot  which offset changes in the mix of tantalum grade purchases 
the conditions necessary to receive price reductions in were met during the fourth quarter of  and accordingly  the estimates of our liability for these purchase commitments were adjusted to reflect the fact that we would receive these conditional price reductions for the remainder of the contract 
the amount of this adjustment was approximately million 
this adjustment  net of approximately million of costs associated with differences between the actual and anticipated mix of tantalum grades purchased during  resulted in the net gain included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the loss on purchase commitments recorded in was primarily attributable to changes in the mix of tantalum grade purchases 
the losses on purchase commitments recorded in and were primarily attributable to declines in market value 
write downs of inventory on hand were generally for raw materials 
the write down of inventory on hand for includes million of finished goods from certain discontinued tantalum capacitor product lines 
while our purchase commitments have been completely satisfied  we will continue to evaluate if write downs of the value of inventory on hand are necessary 
see critical accounting policies and estimates below 
tower semiconductor foundry agreement our siliconix subsidiary maintains long term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front end capacity 
in  siliconix signed a definitive long term foundry agreement for semiconductor manufacturing with tower semiconductor  pursuant to which siliconix would purchase semiconductor wafers from and transfer certain technology to tower semiconductor 
pursuant to the agreement  siliconix was required to place orders valued at approximately million for the purchase of semiconductor wafers to be manufactured in tower s fab facility over a seven to ten year period 
the agreement specifies minimum quantities per month and a fixed quantity for the term of the agreement 
siliconix must pay for any short fall in minimum order quantities specified under the agreement through the payment of penalties equal to unavoidable fixed costs 
pursuant to the agreement  siliconix advanced million to tower in  to be used for the purchase of additional equipment required to satisfy siliconix s orders 
this advance was considered a prepayment on future wafer purchases  reducing the per wafer cost to siliconix over the term of the agreement 
during  siliconix was committed to purchase approximately million of semiconductor wafers  but did not meet its commitments due to changing market demand for products manufactured using wafers supplied by tower 
siliconix was required to pay penalties of approximately million  which were recorded as a component of costs of products sold 
in january  siliconix reached an agreement in principle to revise the current arrangement with tower to more accurately reflect market demand 
siliconix is presently negotiating the terms of a new legal contract 
based on the penalties paid in and the agreement in principle  management has determined that it is unlikely that siliconix will be able to utilize the remaining prepayment of million 
management has also accrued an additional million based on its best estimate of additional contract termination charges related to the original agreement 
remaining future purchase commitments under the original tower agreement are approximately million 
if siliconix is unable to finalize a new agreement with tower  significant additional penalties may be incurred 
foreign currency in  we realized approximately of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
any third party revenues not using the us dollar as the functional currency must be reported in the local currency and be translated at the weighted average exchange rate 
this translation has an impact on the net revenues line of the consolidated statements of operations and also on the expense lines of the consolidated statements of operations 
we generally do not purchase foreign currency exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  although we do maintain cash balances in foreign currencies to act as a natural hedge of certain net exposures 
as of december  and  we had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
see item a for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange risk 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale  title and risk of loss have been transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed or determinable 
for a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery  we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
we historically have had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return 
we have modified these arrangements to allow distributors a limited credit for unsaleable products  which we term a scrap allowance 
consistent with industry practice  we also have a stock  ship and debit program whereby we consider  and grant at our discretion  requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors inventory  to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing 
in addition  we have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions that we initiate after sale of product to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor 
we record end of period accruals for each of the programs based upon our estimate of future credits under the programs that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period 
we calculate reductions of revenue attributable to each of the programs during any period by computing the change in the accruals from the prior period and adding the credits actually given to distributors during the period under the programs 
these procedures require the exercise of significant judgments  but we believe they enable us to estimate reasonably future credits under the programs 
recording and monitoring of these accruals takes place at our subsidiaries and divisions  with input from sales and marketing personnel and review  assessment and  if necessary  adjustment by corporate management 
while our subsidiaries and divisions utilize different methodologies based on their individual experiences  all of the methodologies take into account certain elements that management considers relevant  such as sales to distributors during the relevant period  inventory levels at the distributors  current and projected market trends and conditions  recent and historical activity under the relevant programs  changes in program policies  and open requests for credits 
in our judgment  the different methodologies provide us with equally reliable estimates upon which to base our accruals 
we do not track the credits that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories  so as to directly compare revenue reduction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period 
nevertheless  we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates 
we recognize royalty revenue in accordance with agreed upon terms when performance obligations are satisfied  the amount is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we earn royalties at the point of sale of products which incorporate licensed intellectual property 
the amount of royalties recognized is determined based on our licensees periodic reporting to us and judgments and estimates by vishay management that we believe are reasonable 
however  it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates 
accounts receivable our receivables represent a significant portion of our current assets 
we are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible 
we base these allowances on our historical collection experience  the length of time our receivables are outstanding  the financial circumstances of individual customers  and general business and economic conditions 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out method and market based upon net realizable value 
the valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates 
for instance  in the case of tantalum  we estimate market value by obtaining current quotations from available sources of supply 
for work in process goods  we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products 
for finished goods  we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold 
over the past few years  as further described below  we have recorded write downs of our tantalum and palladium inventories to then current market value 
inventories are also adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand  technology developments and market conditions 
write downs of inventories and purchase commitments in recent years  we took charges against contractual commitments to purchase tantalum powder and wire through and wrote down our existing inventory of tantalum ore  powder  and wire to then present market value 
we did this because the current market prices of tantalum are substantially below the prices at which we were committed to purchase tantalum under long term contracts and the prices at which we were carrying our tantalum raw materials inventory 
these actions involved significant judgments on our part  including decisions of whether to take these charges and write downs  their timing and their amount 
we made the decision to take the charges and write downs after our management concluded that the substantial fall off in the demand for tantalum capacitors  first experienced in  was likely to continue for the foreseeable future 
combining this assessment with the worldwide over capacity in tantalum production  we could not foresee when tantalum prices might recover from their currently depressed levels 
although we believe that both the charges and write downs as well as their timing were appropriate under the circumstances  our visibility for future demand and pricing is limited and the judgments made by our management necessarily involved subjective assessments 
losses on purchase commitments and the related liability that was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was estimated based on our contractually obligated purchase prices  expected market prices  and the contractually obligated mix of tantalum grades to be purchased 
the mix of tantalum grades to be purchased is within a range specified by the contracts 
there is no established market on which tantalum raw materials are regularly traded and quoted 
we based our determination of current market price on quotations from two suppliers of these materials 
we cannot say that the prices at which we could currently enter into contracts for the purchase of tantalum would be the same as these quoted prices 
had we made other assumptions on current and future prices for tantalum  the amount of the inventory write downs and the losses on our purchase commitments would have been different 
as of december   we have fulfilled all obligations under the cabot contracts and are no longer required to purchase tantalum from cabot at these fixed prices 
while our purchase commitments have been completely satisfied  we will continue to evaluate if write downs of the value of inventory on hand are necessary 
the uncertainty over further write downs is exacerbated by the fact that we have large quantities of tantalum on hand 
our minimum purchase commitments under the contracts with cabot exceeded our production requirements for tantalum capacitors over the term of the contract 
tantalum powder and wire have an indefinite shelf life  therefore  we believe that we will eventually utilize all of the material in our inventory 
based on usage currently expected in  our inventory on hand represents between one and two years of usage 
while we expect to utilize all of the tantalum powder and wire in our inventory  if the downward pricing trend were to resume  we could be required to record additional write downs of the carrying value of inventory on hand 
if tantalum prices were to recover in the future  we would not reverse the write downs that we have taken on our raw materials inventory  so that our cost of materials will continue to reflect these write downs regardless of future price increases in tantalum 
this could have the effect of increasing the earnings that we realize in future periods 
estimates of restructuring and severance costs and purchase related restructuring costs in   and  we recorded restructuring and severance costs of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
our restructuring activities related to existing business were designed to reduce both our fixed and variable costs 
acquisition related restructuring costs  which were not significant in   or  are included in the allocation of the cost of the acquired business and generally add to goodwill 
other restructuring costs are expensed during the period in which we determine that we will incur those costs  and all of the requirements for accrual are met 
because these costs are recorded based upon estimates  our actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs 
if this happens  we will have to adjust our estimates in future periods 
in the case of acquisition related restructuring costs  if our initial estimate is too high  this would generally require a change in value of the goodwill appearing on our balance sheet  but would not affect our earnings 
once our allocation of purchase price of a respective acquisition is finalized  if our initial estimate of purchase related restructuring costs is too low  we would be required to record additional expenses in future periods 
in the case of other restructuring costs  we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods  if our initial estimates were too low  or to reverse part of the charges that we recorded initially  if our initial estimates were too high 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
these tests will be performed more frequently if there are triggering events 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit using a comparable companies market multiple approach 
the comparable companies utilized in our evaluation are the members of our peer group included in the presentation of our stock performance in our annual proxy statement 
if the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  we would then perform the second step of the impairment test  which requires allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill 
an impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying amount 
we noted no impairment in our annual assessment of goodwill during the years ended december    or impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of our long lived assets  other than goodwill and tradenames  including property and equipment  long term prepaid assets  and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset  changes in historical or projected operating performance  and significant negative economic trends 
during the years ended december    and  we recorded fixed asset write downs of million  million  and million  respectively 
asset write downs included amounts to reduce the carrying value of certain buildings which had been vacated as part of our restructuring activities  based on expected future selling prices or the present value of expected rental receipts 
asset write downs also included charges to write down certain equipment to salvage value after we determined that it would not be used at other vishay locations subsequent to the completion of our restructuring plans 
during the year ended december   we recorded a write off of prepaid assets associated with our tower semiconductor foundry agreement 
pension and other postretirement benefits accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates 
the discount rate at which obligations could effectively be settled and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
other important assumptions include the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels  estimated mortality  and for postretirement medical plans  increases or trends in health care costs 
management reviews these assumptions at least annually 
we use independent actuaries to assist us in preparing these calculations and determining these assumptions 
these assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate 
our defined benefit plans are concentrated in the united states  germany  and the republic of china taiwan 
plans in these countries comprise approximately of our retirement obligations at december  in the us  we utilize published long term high quality bond indices to determine the discount rate at the measurement date 
in germany and the republic of china taiwan  we utilize published long term government bond rates to determine the discount rate at the measurement date 
we utilize bond yields at various maturity dates to reflect the timing of expected future benefit payments 
we believe the discount rates selected are the rates at which these obligations could effectively be settled 
within the us  we establish strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk 
many of our non us plans are unfunded based on local laws and customs 
for those non us plans that do maintain investments  their asset holdings are primarily cash and fixed income securities  based on local laws and customs 
we set the expected long term rate of return based on the expected long term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios 
in establishing this rate  we consider historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested  advice from pension consultants and investment advisors  and current economic and capital market conditions 
the expected return on plan assets is incorporated into the computation of pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset losses gains affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
we believe that the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and annual expense are appropriate in the current economic environment 
however  if economic conditions change  we may be inclined to change some of our assumptions  and the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations and on the consolidated balance sheet 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances and the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 
these accruals are based on management s best estimate of potential tax exposures 
when particular matters arise  a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved 
favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 
during  several matters were favorably resolved as a result of the completion of examinations and the retroactive approval of our application for tax incentives in certain jurisdictions 
during  certain matters were resolved unfavorably  which required us to make tax payments 
we file us federal income tax returns  as well as income tax returns in multiple us state and foreign jurisdictions 
the us internal revenue service has concluded its examinations of vishay s us federal tax returns for all tax years through because of net operating losses  our us federal tax returns for and will remain subject to examination until the losses are utilized 
the tax returns of significant consolidated subsidiaries are currently under examination  including germany  israel and later years  and republic of china taiwan and later years 
we are also subject to income taxes in other taxing jurisdictions in the us and around the world  many of which are still open to tax examinations 
in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fin effective january  we have recorded deferred tax assets representing future tax benefits  but may not be able to realize these future tax benefits in certain jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the expected future realizability of these deferred tax assets 
we periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets

we continue to see strong results in the consumer sector primarily impacting asia driven by end use demand for mp players  lcd television sets  and gaming equipment 
we also saw excellent results in the telecommunications market  and a continued upturn for laptop computers 
we deduct  from the sales that we record to distributors  allowances for future credits that we expect to provide for returns  scrapped product  and price adjustments under various programs made available to the distributors 
we make deductions corresponding to particular sales in the period in which the sales are made  although the corresponding credits may not be issued until future periods 
we estimate the deductions based on sales levels to distributors  inventory levels at the distributors  current and projected market trends and conditions  recent and historical activity under the relevant programs  changes in program policies  and open requests for credits 
we recorded deductions from gross sales under our distributor incentive programs of million  million  and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively  or  as a percentage of gross sales   and  respectively 
we also assumed million of liabilities for distributor incentive programs as part of our acquisitions in actual credits issued under the programs for the years ended december    and were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
increases and decreases in these incentives are largely attributable to the then current business climate 
as a result of a concentrated effort to defend our intellectual property and generate additional licensing income  we began receiving royalties in the fourth quarter of we expect royalty revenues to increase and we continue to seek to expand our royalty streams 
royalty revenues  included in net revenues on the consolidated statements of operations  were million  million  and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
gross profit and margins costs of products sold as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to for the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in gross profit margin reflects lower average selling prices  higher precious metals and raw materials costs  a less favorable product sales mix  and some production inefficiencies

segments analysis of revenues and gross profit margins for our semiconductors and passive components segments is provided below 
semiconductors business in our semiconductors segment has continued to be stable throughout  with orders increasing across several product lines 
we continue to expand capacity and introduce new technologies and products

gross profit margin for was also negatively impacted by the acquisition of the pcs business  which has lower gross profit margins than legacy vishay products 
additionally  gross profit margins of the semiconductors segment for reflect charges to resolve past quality issues of million 
passive components our passive components segment has shown steady improvement over the past two years  due to cost reduction and a better pricing strategy 
the profitability for this segment is expected to improve as a result of our on going optimization and cost reduction efforts 
net revenues of the passive components segment were as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  net revenues   change versus prior year   percentage change versus prior year changes in passive components segment net revenues were attributable to the following vs

several significant cost reduction programs have been initiated in all passive components product lines  including combining facilities and shifting production to lower cost regions 
the impact of these cost savings plans has been partially offset by the underutilization of capacity in commodity products 
additionally  several items impact the comparability of gross margins of the passive components segment  as summarized in the table below in thousands years ended december  loss gain on purchase commitments  write downs of tantalum and palladium inventories  settlement of past quality issues  the improvement in gross margin for is primarily due to the absence of these charges 
the improvements in gross margin attributable to the absence of these charges is partially offset by lower sales volume  higher precious metals and raw materials costs  and a less favorable product mix 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses for the year ended december  increased by approximately million compared to the prior year  although sg a expenses were generally stable as a percentage of net revenues 
sg a expenses were of net revenues for as compared to of net revenues for the prior year 
the increased level of sg a costs for reflects approximately million of transition services costs related to the pcs business 
the sg a costs from transition services agreements with international rectifier have gradually decreased over the past three quarters and expire in the first quarter of after the conclusion of the transition services agreements with international rectifier  the acquisition of the pcs business is expected to have the impact of reducing sg a costs as a percentage of net revenues 
amortization of intangible assets  included in sg a expenses  was million in  compared to million in this increase in amortization expense is principally due to the acquisition of the pcs business  and to a lesser extent  pm group 
a weaker us dollar and increases in salaries and wages versus the prior year also contributed to the increased level of sg a costs 
sg a expenses include gains and losses on the disposal of property and equipment 
the gain on disposal of property and equipment for the year ended december  was million of which million was realized in a single transaction 
the gain on disposal of property and equipment for the year ended december  was million 
sg a expenses for also include million of adjustments to increase the estimated cost of environmental remediation obligations associated with the general semiconductor acquisition 
sg a expenses were of net revenues for as compared to of net revenues for the prior year  partially due to an increased revenue base 
our cost reduction initiatives referred to above also target sg a costs and are reflected in this improvement 
as described above  sg a expenses for include million of adjustments to increase the estimated cost of environmental remediation obligations 
restructuring and severance costs and related asset write downs our restructuring activities have been designed to reduce both fixed and variable costs 
these activities include the closing of facilities and the termination of employees 
because costs are recorded based upon estimates  actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs 
if the initial estimates are too low or too high  we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods or to reverse previously recorded expenses 
we anticipate that we will realize the benefits of our restructuring through lower labor costs and other operating expenses in future periods 
we expect to continue to restructure our operations and incur restructuring and severance costs as explained in cost management above and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we continued our restructuring activities during  recording restructuring and severance costs of million  and recording related asset write downs of million 
other income expense compared to interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million compared to the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the repayment of our liquid yield option notes lyons in june and decreases in the variable rate paid on the exchangeable notes due on june   the holders of our lyons had the option to require us to repurchase the notes for their accreted value on that date 
all lyons holders exercised their option 
as a result of this repurchase  we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt to write off unamortized debt issuance costs of million associated with the lyons 
this non cash write off is reported in a separate line item in the consolidated statement of operations 
the following table analyzes the components of the line other on the consolidated statements of operations in thousands years ended december  change foreign exchange loss   interest income    dividend income other   incentive from chinese government   compared to interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million versus this decrease is primarily related to the repayment of our lyons in june and the impact of lower amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility during the year ended december   partially offset by debt assumed in the acquisition of alpha electronics in the fourth quarter of and increases in the variable rate paid on the exchangeable notes due the following table analyzes the components of the line other on the consolidated statements of operations in thousands years ended december  change foreign exchange loss gain  interest income    dividend income other   incentive from chinese government minority interest minority interest in earnings was not significant for the years ended december  and minority interest in earnings for year ended december  decreased million compared to the year ended december   due to the acquisition of the minority interest in siliconix during the second quarter of income taxes the effective tax rate  based on income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest  for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  we operate in an international environment with significant operations in various locations outside the us accordingly  the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting our earnings and the applicable tax rates in the various locations where we operate 
part of our strategy is to achieve cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to countries where we can benefit from lower labor costs and available tax and other government sponsored incentives 
accordingly  our effective tax rate is generally less than the us statutory tax rate 
changes in the effective tax rate are largely attributable to changes in the mix of pretax income among our various taxing jurisdictions 
additional information about income taxes is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we adopted fin effective january   and recorded a cumulative charge to retained earnings of approximately million 
income tax expense for the year ended december  includes approximately million of tax expense for discrete changes in uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances and related items 
income tax expense for was impacted by benefits totaling million  primarily due to favorable foreign tax rulings 
the effective tax rates for reflect this net benefit  partially offset by the non deductibility of certain items  including the write off of in process research and development and siliconix transaction related expenses 
income tax expense for was also impacted by the favorable completion of an audit of our consolidated us tax returns for the years through  and related carryback years  offset by the tax impact of repatriating million of earnings that had previously been expected to be reinvested outside of the united states indefinitely 
the repatriation allowed us to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards in the united states 
the net tax expense of these items was immaterial 
the effective tax rates for   and also reflect the fact that we could not recognize for accounting purposes the tax benefit of losses incurred in certain jurisdictions  although these losses are available to offset future taxable income 
under applicable accounting principles  we may not recognize deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards in jurisdictions where there is a recent history of cumulative losses  where there is no taxable income in the carryback period  where there is insufficient evidence of future earnings to overcome the loss history and where there is no other positive evidence  such as the likely reversal of taxable temporary differences  that would result in the utilization of loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million as of december   as compared to million as of december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is principally due to cash utilized for the acquisitions of the pcs business of international rectifier and pm group in april  which were funded with cash on hand 
at december   approximately of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our non us subsidiaries 
at the present time  we expect the cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
we were able to utilize cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to acquire a portion of the pcs business and pm group 
our financial condition as of december  continued to be strong  with a current ratio current assets to current liabilities of to  compared to to at december  the decrease in this ratio is primarily due to the decrease in cash as a result of our acquisitions 
our ratio of debt to stockholders equity was to at december   compared to to at december  we focus on our ability to generate cash flows from operations 
the cash generated from operations is used to fund our capital expenditure plans  and cash in excess of our capital expenditure needs is available to fund our acquisition strategy and to reduce debt levels 
vishay has generated cash flows from operations in excess of million in each of the past years  and cash flows from operations in excess of million in each of the past thirteen years 
we refer to the amount of cash generated from operations in excess of our capital expenditure needs and net of proceeds from the sale of assets as free cash 
measurements such as free cash do not have a uniform definition and are not recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
such measures should not be viewed as an alternative to gaap measures of performance or liquidity 
however  management believes that free cash is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions and repay debt 
vishay has generated positive free cash in each of the past eleven years  and free cash in excess of million in each of the past six years 
cash flows provided by continuing operating activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to cash flows provided by operations of million for the year ended december  net working capital of the acquired pcs business increased by million since its acquisition  which had a negative impact on reported cash flows from continuing operating activities 
we acquired the pcs business with very little net working capital 
net revenues from pcs business product lines since the date of acquisition have generated a significant increase in accounts receivable 
cash used by discontinued operating activities of million primarily reflects an increase in working capital of the asbu business 
cash used by discontinued investing activities reflects capital spending for information technology systems 
cash paid for property and equipment for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million in the prior year 
our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately million in  principally to expand capacity in the semiconductors businesses  and to continue to integrate information technology systems of the newly acquired pcs business with our legacy systems 
cash paid for acquisitions for the year ended december  was million  representing the acquisitions of the pcs business and pm group  net of cash acquired 
proceeds from sale of businesses of million include approximately million from the sale of pm group s electrical contracting business 
cash paid for acquisitions for the year ended december  of million reflect the acquisition of phoenix do brasil 
our debt levels are essentially the same at december  as they were at december  pursuant to the terms of the convertible subordinated notes due  the holders of these notes have the right to require us to repurchase these notes on august  and other specified future dates at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes million 
if these notes are put to us in august  we intend to utilize our revolving credit facility or a replacement debt instrument to fund the purchase 
pursuant to the indenture governing the notes  we have the right to pay the purchase price for the notes in cash  vishay common stock  or a combination of both 
in june  our board of directors adopted a resolution pursuant to which we intend to waive our rights to settle the principal amount of the notes in shares of vishay common stock 
in accordance with the resolution of our board  if notes are tendered for repurchase  we will pay the repurchase price in cash 
if notes are submitted for conversion  vishay will value the shares issuable upon conversion and will pay in cash an amount equal to the principal amount of the converted notes and will issue shares in respect of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount 
our board adopted this resolution because our liquidity has changed since entering into the indenture governing the notes in we have generated at least million in cash flows from operations each year since we also have adequate borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility described below  if necessary  to make all principal payments on the notes in cash 
we maintain a secured revolving credit facility  which was amended and restated on april  this new revolving credit facility replaced our previous revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to expire on may  at december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under the respective revolving credit facilities 
the new revolving credit facility provides a commitment of up to million through april  furthermore  we are permitted to request an increase of the revolving credit facility by an additional million  resulting in an aggregate commitment up to million  provided that no default or event of default exists 
interest on the new revolving credit facility is payable at prime or other variable interest rate options 
we are required to pay facility commitment fees  which are less than the commitment fees that were required under the expired revolving credit facility 
similar to the expired revolving credit facility  the new revolving credit facility also restricts us from paying cash dividends and requires us to comply with other covenants  including the maintenance of specific financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  borrowings under the new revolving credit facility are secured by pledges of stock in certain significant subsidiaries and certain guarantees by significant subsidiaries 
the subsidiaries would be required to perform under the guarantees in the event that vishay failed to make principal or interest payments under the new revolving credit facility 
certain of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the new revolving credit facility 
any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the new revolving credit facility are guaranteed by vishay 
the timing and location of scheduled payments has required us to draw on our revolving credit facilities from time to time over the past year 
while the timing and location of scheduled payments for certain liabilities may require us to draw on our revolving credit facilities from time to time  for the next twelve months  management expects that cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements  to meet our obligations under restructuring and acquisition integration programs  and to fund our research and development and capital expenditure plans 
additional acquisition activity or the repurchase of the convertible subordinated notes in august may require additional borrowing under our revolving credit facilities or may otherwise require us to incur additional debt 
contractual commitments as of december  we had contractual obligations as follows in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt   interest payments on long term debt     capital and operating leases      expected pension and postretirement plan funding      estimated costs to complete construction in progress    uncertain tax positions    purchase commitments tower      purchase commitments other    total contractual cash obligations   pursuant to the terms of the convertible subordinated notes due  the holders of these notes will have the right to put these notes to us on august   august   august  and august  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes million 
the commitments set forth in the table are based on the stated maturity dates and do not assume acceleration of payment pursuant to the respective options of the holders 
commitments for interest payments on long term debt are based on the stated maturity dates of each agreement  one of which bears a maturity date of various factors could have a material effect on the amount of future interest payments 
these factors include the facts that substantially all of our debt instruments are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock  that the holders of our convertible subordinated notes due have an option to put these notes to us on specified dates  and that interest commitments for our variable rate exchangeable notes due are based on the rate prevailing at december  commitments for interest payments on long term debt also include commitment fees under our revolving credit facility  which expires in may our consolidated balance sheet at december  includes approximately million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in multiple taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business 
of this amount  million is expected to be paid in less than one year 
due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded  with the exception of the million described above  we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 
accordingly  the remaining uncertain tax positions were classified as payments due after five years 
we maintain long term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front end capacity for our semiconductor products 
our siliconix division has an agreement with tower semiconductor  pursuant to which we were required to place orders valued at approximately million for the purchase of semiconductor wafers to be manufactured in tower s fab facility over a seven to ten year period 
during  siliconix was committed to purchase approximately million of semiconductor wafers  but did not meet its commitments due to changing market demand for products manufactured using wafers supplied by tower 
in january  siliconix reached an agreement in principle to revise the current arrangement with tower to more accurately reflect market demand 
siliconix is presently negotiating the terms of a new legal contract 
because the original tower agreement is still in force  the table above shows the remaining commitments under the original agreement 
management expects that these commitments will be substantially reduced pursuant to the new contract based on the agreement in principle reached in january if siliconix is unable to finalize a new agreement with tower  significant additional penalties may be incurred 
in  our siliconix division entered a five year foundry agreement for semiconductor manufacturing with a subcontractor in japan 
the agreement calls for siliconix to provide a rolling twelve month forecast of estimated requirements 
the first six months of this forecast are fixed as to quantity  and the subsequent six months are guaranteed not to be less than a quantity stated in the agreement 
thereafter  the monthly quantity may vary based on market demand 
under the agreement siliconix must guarantee that its business with this subcontractor represents a minimum percentage of wafer requirements and is required to use its best efforts not to reduce the average monthly demand rate below a specified threshold best efforts threshold 
the purchase commitments in the table above represent the minimum commitments for year one based on the fixed quantities for months one through six and the minimum average quantities for months seven through twelve  and the expected minimum commitment based on the best efforts threshold for the remainder of the agreement 
our actual purchases in future periods are expected to be greater than these minimum commitments 
generally accepted accounting principles require that management evaluate if purchase commitments are at prices in excess of current market price 
the purchase commitments for silicon wafers entered by siliconix are for the manufacture of proprietary products using siliconix owned technology licensed to this subcontractor by siliconix  and accordingly  management can only estimate the market price of the wafers which are the subject of these commitments 
management believes that these commitments are at prices which are not in excess of estimated current market prices 
for a further discussion of our long term debt  pensions and other postretirement benefits  leases  uncertain tax positions  and purchase commitments  see notes     and to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation normally  inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long term contracts 
consequently  we can adjust our selling prices  to the extent permitted by competition  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
recent accounting pronouncements as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  several new accounting pronouncements became effective in or will become effective in future periods 
the adoption of sfas no 
r  business combinations  effective january   will change the manner in which vishay accounts for acquisitions 
while this new standard will impact all companies  certain aspects of the new standard will have a particular impact on vishay 
a primary tenet of our business strategy is the expansion within the electronic components industry through the acquisition of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets  reputations for product quality and reliability  and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise 
our acquisition strategy relies upon reducing selling  general  and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales offices and administrative functions at acquired companies  and achieving significant production cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to countries where we can benefit from lower labor costs and available tax and other government sponsored incentives 
under present accounting standards  plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities are included in the costs of our acquisitions and do not affect earnings or losses on our statement of operations 
sfas no 
r will require such costs to be recorded as expenses in our statement of operations  as such expenses are incurred 
except as described above  the adoption of the new standards described in note to our consolidated financial statements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure we are exposed to certain financial risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances 
on a selective basis  we have in the past entered into interest rate swap or cap agreements to reduce the potential negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt 
as of december    and we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap or cap agreements 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our floating rate revolving credit facility 
at december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under this facility 
at december   we had approximately million of debt outstanding 
of this amount  million represents our convertible subordinated notes due  and million represents our exchangeable notes due we have no interest rate exposure to our convertible subordinated notes  as the interest payable on these notes is fixed 
however  the holders of these notes have the right to require us to repurchase these notes on august  and other specified future dates at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes million 
if these notes are put to us in august  we intend to utilize our revolving credit facility or a replacement debt instrument to fund the purchase 
due to interest rate fluctuations and other factors  the costs to refinance this debt may be greater than current interest rates 
we do have interest rate exposure with respect to our variable rate exchangeable notes 
the exchangeable notes bear interest at libor  which is reset quarterly 
at december   we have approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual net earnings by approximately million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our long term debt 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks  particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries 
from time to time  we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in germany  israel  and asia 
we finance our operations in europe and certain locations in asia in local currencies 
our operations in israel and most significant locations in asia are largely financed in us dollars  but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies 
we estimate that a movement in the value of the us dollar against all foreign currencies would impact our net earnings by approximately million  although individual line items in our consolidated statement of operations would be materially affected 
for example  a weakening in all foreign currencies would increase the us dollar equivalent of operating income generated in foreign currencies  which would be offset by foreign exchange losses of our foreign subsidiaries that have significant transactions in us dollars or have the us dollar as their functional currency 
if the us dollar strengthened or weakened by versus each of the following foreign currencies  with all other currencies being held constant  we estimate that our net earnings would increase decrease as follows in thousands strengthening weakening currency euro  israeli shekel   hong kong dollar   singapore dollar taiwan dollar british pound hungarian forint philippines peso brazilian real czech koruna chinese renminbi all other currencies  net all currencies simultaneously   commodity price risk many of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials  the quality of available raw materials deteriorates  or there are significant price increases for these raw materials 
for example  the prices for tantalum and palladium  two raw materials that we use in our capacitors  are subject to fluctuation 
for periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising  we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used 
for periods in which the prices are declining  we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials  since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost  this write down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 
we recorded substantial write downs of tantalum and palladium in the economic downturn from to  and recorded more modest write downs in and we estimate that a increase or decrease in the costs of raw materials subject to commodity price risk would decrease or increase our net earnings by million  assuming that such changes in our costs have no impact on the selling prices of our products
