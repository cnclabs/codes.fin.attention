item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the information described under the caption risk factors below 
readers should also be cautioned that results of any reported period are often not indicative of results for any future period 
overview we derive our net sales primarily from sales of internet related communication products  principally broadband and dial up modems and other communication products  to retailers  distributors  internet service providers and original equipment manufacturers 
we sell our products through a direct sales force and through independent sales agents 
our employees are primarily located at our headquarters in boston  massachusetts and our sales office in the united kingdom 
we typically design our hardware products  though we do sometimes use another company s design if it meets our requirements 
electronic assembly and testing of the company s products in accordance with our specifications is typically done in china 
for many years we performed most of the final assembly  test  packaging  warehousing and distribution at a production and warehouse facility on summer street in boston  massachusetts  which has also engaged in firmware programming for some products 
on june  we announced our plans to move most of our summer street operations to a dedicated facility in tijuana  mexico commencing approximately september   and we have implemented that plan 
our lease for our summer street facility expired in august  and we completely vacated the facility on september  our mexican maquiladora manufacturing operation is managed by a maquiladora management company 
since our headquarters has been near south station in downtown boston 
zoom has owned two adjacent buildings which connect on most floors  and which house our entire boston staff 
in december we sold our headquarters buildings to a third party  with a two year lease back of approximately  square feet of the  square foot facility 
our net sale proceeds were approximately million of which approximately million was repaid to our mortgage holder  eliminating the mortgage debt from our balance sheet 
our lease expires in december a renewal of our current lease may require an increase in our monthly rent 
we would likely move our headquarters to a new location in the same general area of boston to avoid a material increase in our monthly rent 
in the event this lease is not further extended  we believe we will be able to find alternative space that is suitable and adequate for our headquarters operation 
for many years we derived a majority of our net sales from the retail after market sale of dial up modems to customers seeking to add or upgrade a modem for their personal computers 
in recent years the size of this market and our sales to this market have declined  as personal computer manufacturers have incorporated a modem as a built in component in most consumer personal computers and as increasing numbers of consumers world wide have switched to broadband internet access 
the consensus of communications industry analysts is that after market sales of dial up modems will probably continue to decline 
there is also consensus among industry analysts that the installed base for broadband internet connection devices  such as cable modems and dsl modems  will grow rapidly during the decade 
in response to increased and forecasted worldwide demand for faster connection speeds and increased modem functionality  we have invested and continue to invest resources to advance our product line of broadband modems  both dsl modems and cable modems 
we continually seek to improve our product designs and manufacturing approach in order to improve product performance and reduce our costs 
we pursue a strategy of outsourcing rather than internally developing our modem chipsets  which are application specific integrated circuits that form the technology base for our modems 
by outsourcing the chipset technology  we are able to concentrate our research and development resources on modem system design  leverage the extensive research and development capabilities of our chipset suppliers  and reduce our development time and associated costs and risks 
as a result of this approach  we are able to quickly develop new products while maintaining a relatively low level of research and development expense as a percentage of net sales 
we also outsource aspects of our manufacturing to contract manufacturers as a means of reducing our costs of production  and to provide us with greater flexibility in our production capacity 
over the past several years our net sales have declined 
in response to declining sales volume  we have cut costs by reducing staffing and some overhead costs 
our total headcount of full time employees  including temporary workers  went from on december  to on december  of the decline of employees  were related to the outsourcing of our final assembly manufacturing operation to mexico 
our dedicated manufacturing personnel in mexico are employees of our mexican manufacturing service provider and not included in our headcount 
of the employees on december   were engaged in research and development  were involved in manufacturing oversight  purchasing  assembly  packaging  shipping and quality control  were engaged in sales  marketing and technical support  and the remaining performed accounting  administrative  management information systems  and executive functions 
generally our gross margin for a given product depends on a number of factors including the type of customer to whom we are selling 
the gross margin for retailers tends to be higher than for some of our other customers  but the sales  support  returns  and overhead costs associated with retailers also tend to be higher 
zoom s sales to certain countries  including turkey  vietnam  and saudi arabia  are currently handled by a single master distributor for each country who handles the support and marketing costs within the country 
gross margin for sales to these master distributors tends to be low  since lower pricing to these distributors helps them to cover the support and marketing costs for their country 
in our net sales were up compared to the sales increase was mainly the result of strong increases in dsl and cable modem sales which were substantially offset by declines in dial up modem and wireless product sales 
in we made new placements of dsl modems in large retailers in the us and the us and new placements of cable modems in large retailers in the us sales of dsl modems to a previously large customer in turkey essentially stopped in we attribute this decline to a number of factors including increased competition and actions by turkish telecom to dramatically increase their bundling of dsl modems with their service 
because of our significant customer concentration our net sales and operating results have fluctuated and in the future could continue to fluctuate significantly due to changes in political or economic conditions or the loss  reduction of business  or less favorable terms for any of our significant customers 
since we had a minority interest in a privately held software company  intermute  inc in june intermute was acquired by trend micro inc  a us subsidiary of trend micro japan 
in connection with the acquisition  in june we received a payment of approximately million which we recorded as a non operating gain in our second quarter of we realized in cash an additional contingent gain of  during the quarter ended september   representing our portion of an earn out payment paid by the buyer as a result of the achievement of a performance milestone 
on november  we received a second and final performance milestone payment  also of  in december we received a return of our escrow deposit of approximately  there will be no further payments from the sale of intermute 
total net proceeds from the sale of our minority interest in intermute were million  received over and our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was million  down from million at december  this reduction was due primarily to our million loss for the year and our june million investment transaction with unity business networks  llc 
critical accounting policies and estimates following is a discussion of what we view as our more significant accounting policies and estimates 
as described below  management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified areas where material differences could result in the amount and timing of our net sales  costs  and expenses for any period if we had made different judgments or used different estimates 
revenue net sales recognition 
we primarily sell hardware products to our customers 
the hardware products include dial up modems  dsl modems  cable modems  voice over ip products  and wireless and wired networking equipment 
we earn a small amount of royalty revenue that is included in our net sales  primarily from internet service providers 
we generally do not sell software 
we began selling services in we introduced our global village voip service in late  but sales of those services to date have not been material 
we derive our net sales primarily from the sales of hardware products to four types of customers computer peripherals retailers  computer product distributors  internet service providers  and original equipment manufacturers oems we recognize hardware net sales for our customers at the point when the customers take legal ownership of the delivered products 
legal ownership passes from zoom to the customer based on the contractual fob point specified in signed contracts and purchase orders  which are both used extensively 
many of our customer contracts or purchase orders specify fob destination 
we verify the delivery date on all significant fob destination shipments made during the last business days of each quarter 
our net sales of hardware include reductions resulting from certain events which are characteristic of the sales of hardware to retailers of computer peripherals 
these events are product returns  certain sales and marketing incentives  price protection refunds  and consumer mail in and in store rebates 
each of these is accounted for as a reduction of net sales based on detailed management estimates  which are reconciled to actual customer or end consumer credits on a monthly or quarterly basis 
our voip service revenues were recorded as the end user customer consumed billable voip services 
the end user customer became a service customer by electing to sign up for the global village billable service on the internet 
zoom recorded revenue either when billable services were consumed or when a monthly flat fee service was billed 
product returns 
products are returned by retail stores and distributors for inventory balancing  contractual stock rotation privileges  and warranty repair or replacements 
we estimate the sales and cost value of expected future product returns of previously sold products 
our estimates for product returns are based on recent historical trends plus estimates for returns prompted by  among other things  announced stock rotations and announced customer store closings 
management reviews historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when estimating sales return allowances 
the estimate for future returns is recorded as a reserve against accounts receivable  a reduction in our net sales  and the corresponding change to inventory reserves and cost of sales 
product returns as a percentage of total shipments were and  respectively  for and the figure does not include the impact of the start of the consignment arrangement in at a major retailer customer 
price protection refunds 
we have a policy of offering price protection to certain of our retailer and distributor customers for some or all their inventory 
under the price protection policies  when we reduce our prices for a product  the customer receives a credit for the difference between the original purchase price and our reduced price for their unsold inventory of that product 
our estimates for price protection refunds are based on a detailed understanding and tracking by customer and by sales program 
estimated price protection refunds are recorded in the same period as the announcement of a pricing change 
information from customer inventory on hand reports or from direct communications with the customers is used to estimate the refund  which is recorded as a reduction of net sales and a reserve against accounts receivable 
reductions in our net sales due to price protection were million in and million in sales and marketing incentives 
many of our retailer customers require sales and marketing support funding  usually set as a percentage of our sales in their stores 
the incentives were reported as reductions in our net sales and were million in and million in consumer mail in and in store rebates 
our estimates for consumer mail in and in store rebates are based on a detailed understanding and tracking by customer and sales program  supported by actual rebate claims processed by the rebate redemption centers plus an accrual for an estimated lag in processing at the redemption centers 
the estimate for mail in and in store rebates is recorded as a reserve against accounts receivable and a reduction of net sales in the same period that the rebate obligation was triggered 
reductions in our net sales due to the consumer rebates were million in and million in to ensure that the sales  discounts  and marketing incentives are recorded in the proper period  we perform extensive tracking and documenting by customer  by period  and by type of marketing event 
this tracking includes reconciliation to the accounts receivable records for deductions taken by our customers for these discounts and incentives 
accounts receivable valuation 
we establish accounts receivable valuation allowances equal to the above discussed net sales adjustments for estimates of product returns  price protection refunds  consumer rebates  and general bad debt reserves 
these allowances are reduced as actual credits are issued to the customer s accounts 
our bad debt write offs were less than million for and nominal for inventory valuation and cost of goods sold 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost  determined by the first in  first out method  or market 
we review inventories for obsolete slow moving products each quarter and make provisions based on our estimate of the probability that the material will not be consumed or that it will be sold below cost 
we did not have significant charges to costs and expenses for obsolete or slow moving products in in we recorded an additional charge of million for inventory reserves related to obsolete and slow moving products 
valuation and impairment of deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we estimate our income tax expense and deferred income tax position 
this process involves the estimation of our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
changes in the valuation allowance are reflected in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowances 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets 
it is management s estimate that  after considering all the available objective evidence  historical and prospective  with greater weight given to historical evidence  it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized 
if we establish a record of continuing profitability  at some point we will be required to reduce the valuation allowance and recognize an equal income tax benefit which will increase net income in that period s 
as of december  we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  these federal net operating losses are available to offset future taxable income  and are due to expire in years ranging from to we also had state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  these state net operating losses are available to offset future taxable income  and are primarily due to expire in years ranging from to valuation of investment in affiliates 
since the company had a minority interest in a privately held software company  intermute  inc  which the company had been accounting for under the equity method of accounting 
the company made its original investment in  at the time of intermute s formation  and subsequently made additional investments 
under the equity method of accounting  the company s investment was increased or decreased  not below zero  based upon the company s proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of intermute 
as a result of the losses incurred by intermute subsequent to the company s investments  the company s investment balance was reduced to zero during the company discontinued applying the equity method when the investment was reduced to zero and did not provide for additional losses  as the company did not guarantee obligations of the investee and was not committed to provide further financial support 
in june intermute was acquired by trend micro inc  a us subsidiary of trend micro japan 
in connection with the acquisition  in june the company received a payment of approximately million which was recorded as a non operating gain in the company s second quarter of the company realized in cash an additional contingent gain of million during the quarter ended september   representing its portion of an earnout payment paid by the buyer as a result of the achievement of a performance milestone 
on november  the company received a second and final performance milestone payment  also of million 
in december the company received a return of its escrow deposit of approximately million 
all of the payments were recorded as non operating gains  a total of approximately million in there will be no further payments from the sale of intermute 
total net proceeds from the sale of our minority interest in intermute were million  received over and during the quarter ended september  the company purchased all the series a preferred shares the series a shares of unity business networks  llc unity for cash of million  including transaction costs 
the series a shares are convertible at any time at the company s option into of unity s common stock on a fully diluted basis 
the series a shares convert automatically if unity consummates a public offering with gross proceeds in excess of million or days after unity delivers its audited financial statements to the company 
in addition  the company has an option to purchase all the outstanding common stock of unity based on a specified multiple of unity s revenues  as defined  for the option is exercisable for days following the receipt of unity s audited financial statements 
the company s ceo is a member of unity s five member board of directors 
further  the company is entitled to vote series a shares on an as converted basis with unity s common stock 
the company is unable to exercise significant influence over unity s policies or operations 
the company accounts for its investment in unity at cost 
the investment will be reviewed periodically for potential impairment 
on january   zoom technologies  inc the company and redmoon  inc  a provider of wireless networks headquartered in plano  texas redmoon  entered into a convertible note purchase agreement pursuant to which the company made an initial investment of  in convertible notes the notes and agreed to purchase an additional  per month of convertible notes beginning on may  and continuing until the earlier of i the company s election to exercise the option to purchase all outstanding stock of redmoon contained in the option agreement described below or ii the company s election to terminate such option agreement  up to a maximum total investment of  the notes are senior to all long term liabilities of redmoon and all current liabilities of redmoon in excess of  and are secured by certain equipment of redmoon 
the notes have a term of three years  and  at the company s election  may be converted into shares of series a preferred stock of redmoon 
if the company purchases notes with a total principal amount of  such notes will be convertible into shares of series a preferred stock representing of the fully diluted capitalization of redmoon 
if the company purchases notes with a total principal amount of less than  the number of shares of series a preferred stock issued upon conversion of the notes will be pro rated according to the amount of the actual investment 
on the same date  the company  redmoon and the holders of redmoon s outstanding capital stock entered into an option agreement pursuant to which the company has the right to buy the balance of redmoon any time prior to the close of business on august   unless the company elects to terminate the option agreement prior to that date  at a price equal to  shares of the company s common stock plus up to  additional shares of the company s common stock  or cash or a combination of cash and stock of equivalent value  with any issuance of some or all of the  additional shares or share equivalents based on redmoon s performance during the five calendar quarters beginning with the quarter ending june  finally  on the same date the company and redmoon entered into a security agreement granting the company a security interest in certain equipment of redmoon  and the company  redmoon  and certain of redmoon s stockholders entered into a voting agreement whereby the company and certain stockholders of redmoon agreed to elect frank manning  chief executive officer of the company  and bryan thompson  chief executive officer of redmoon  to the board of directors of redmoon 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expense selling general and administration research and development operating profit loss before sale of real estate gain on sale of real estate operating profit loss other income expense gain on sale of investment in intermute  inc other  net total other income expense loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following is a discussion of the major categories of our consolidated statement of operations  comparing the financial results for the year ended december  with the year ended december  net sales 
our total net sales increased year over year by million or 
in we primarily generated our sales by selling dial up and broadband modems via retailers  distributors  and internet service providers 
the dial up modem market has continued to decline  and zoom sales of dial up modems declined million due primarily to the decline of the dial up modem market 
our dsl broadband modem category increased million primarily as a result of increased placements at large electronic retailers the us and the us  partially offset by a million decline of dsl sales to our turkish distributor due to actions by turkish telecom which dramatically increased their bundling of dsl modems with their service offerings 
net sales in our other product sales category  which included primarily cable modems  increased from million in to million in the following table illustrates this change in net sales 
year sales year sales change change dial up dsl cable and other products total net sales as shown in the table below our net sales in north america increased million or from million in to million in our net sales in turkey were negligible in compared to million in  a decrease 
the dramatic decline of our sales in turkey resulted from decreased dsl sales to our turkish distributor due to actions by turkish telecom which dramatically increased their bundling of dsl modems with their service offerings 
this action significantly reduced the retail market for dsl modems in turkey 
our net sales in the uk were million in compared to million in  a increase 
the sales increase in north america and the uk primarily reflect our increased sales of broadband modems in our retailer channel  which offset the continued decline of dial up modem sales in all channels 
our net sales in all other countries were million in compared to million in  a decline 
the sales decline in all other countries was primarily due to declining sales of dial up modems and dsl modems 
year sales year sales change change north america turkey uk all other total net sales during three customers each accounted for or more of our total net sales 
together these three customers accounted for of our total net sales 
during  a single customer accounted for more than of our total net sales 
because of our customer concentration  our net sales and operating income could fluctuate significantly due to changes in political or economic conditions or the loss  reduction of business  or less favorable terms for any of our significant customers 
gross profit 
our gross profit was million in compared to million in our gross profit percentage of net sales increased to in from in the primary reason for this increase was lower obsolescence expense and lower manufacturing expense 
both our fixed and variable manufacturing costs were lower in compared to as a result of the third quarter transition of production to mexico 
operating expense 
total operating expense excluding the gain on sale of real estate decreased by million from million in to million in total operating expense excluding the gain on sale of real estate as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in the table below illustrates the change in operating expense 
operating expense year sales net sales year sales net sales change change selling expense general and administrative expense research and development expense total operating expense excluding the gain on sale of real estate selling expense 
selling expense decreased from million in to million in selling expense as a percentage of net sales was in and in the million reduction in selling expense was primarily due to reduced personnel costs due to lower employee headcount 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in and million in general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was in and in in compared to  general and administrative expense decreased million primarily due to a reduction in personnel costs million and legal  audit and consulting fees million  partially offset by the increase in facility expenses as a result of the sale and leaseback of our headquarters facility in late million 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased from million in to million in research and development expense as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in the million decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to reduced personnel costs million 
gain on sale of real estate 
in we recognized a gain in operations on the sale of real estate of million 
the gain as a percentage of net sales was in in december  we sold the real estate housing our corporate headquarters and concurrently entered into a leaseback arrangement for a portion of the property 
the leaseback arrangement is for two years 
a gain of million was realized on the sale 
however  a portion of the gain million was deferred and is being recognized in operations over the term of the lease million in and million in 
the gain initially deferred is the estimated present value of the minimum lease payments under the leaseback arrangement 
other income expense 
other income  net decreased to million in from million in the million other income in included million gain under an earn out provision from the sale of our investment in intermute in a prior year 
we will not receive any additional similar payments 
income tax expense benefit 
we recorded a favorable million net income tax benefit in resulting solely from changes in prior years estimates 
we have not recognized any income tax benefits on our operating losses in and because we are in a net operating loss carry forward position and realization of such benefits is unlikely 
liquidity and capital resources on december  we had working capital of million including million in cash and cash equivalents 
on december  we had working capital of million including million in cash and cash equivalents 
our current ratio at december  was compared to at december  a significant portion in the reduction of the current ratio was due to our net loss of million and the cash expenditure of million for our june investment in unity business networks  llc 
in operating activities used million in cash 
our net loss in was million 
sources of cash from operations included a decrease in accounts receivable of million  non cash stock based compensation of million  non cash depreciation and amortization expense of million  and a decrease in inventories of million 
uses of cash from operations included a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expense of million and a non cash gain on sale of real estate of million 
in our net cash used by investing activities was million  which included our investment in unity business networks  llc of million in there was no significant cash provided by or used in financing activities 
to conserve cash and manage our liquidity  we have implemented cost cutting initiatives including the reduction of employee headcount and overhead costs 
as of december  we had full time employees compared to as of december  we plan to continue to assess our cost structure as it relates to our revenues and cash position  and we may make further reductions if the actions are deemed necessary 
management believes we have sufficient resources to fund our normal operations over the next months  through at least december  however  if we are unable to increase our revenues  reduce or otherwise adequately control our expenses  or raise capital  our longer term ability to continue as a going concern and achieve our intended business objectives could be adversely affected 
see risk factors below  for further information with respect to events and uncertainties that could harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
item a 
risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report are applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
to stay in business we may require future additional funding  which we may be unable to obtain on favorable terms  if at all 
over the next twelve months we may require additional financing for our operations either to fund losses beyond those we anticipate or to fund growth in our inventory and accounts receivable 
our revolving credit facility expired on march  and we currently have no line of credit from which we can borrow 
additional financing may not be available to us on a timely basis if at all  or on terms acceptable to us 
if we fail to obtain acceptable additional financing when needed  we may not have sufficient resources to fund our normal operations and we may be required to further reduce planned expenditures or forego business opportunities 
these factors could reduce our net sales  increase our losses  and harm our business 
moreover  additional equity financing could dilute the per share value of our common stock held by current shareholders  while additional debt financing could restrict our ability to make capital expenditures or incur additional indebtedness  all of which would impede our ability to succeed 
the market for high speed communications products and services has many competing technologies and  as a result  the demand for certain of our products and services is declining 
industry analysts believe that the market for our dial up modems will continue to decline 
if we are unable to increase demand for and sales of our broadband modems  we may be unable to sustain or grow our business 
the market for high speed communications products and services has a number of competing technologies 
for instance  internet access can be achieved by using a standard telephone line and appropriate service for dial up modems  dsl modems  using a cable modem with a cable tv line and cable modem service  using a router and some type of modem to service the computers connected to a local area network  or other approaches  including wireless links to the internet 
although we currently sell products that include these technologies  our most successful products have historically been our dial up modems 
the introduction of new products by competitors  market acceptance of competing products based on new or alternative technologies  or the emergence of new industry standards have in the past rendered and could continue to render our products less competitive or even obsolete 
for example  these factors have caused the market for our dial up modems to shrink dramatically 
if we are unable to increase demand for our broadband modems  we may be unable to sustain or grow our business 
we may not be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq capital market if we are unable to satisfy the minimum bid price requirements 
our stock is currently trading below per share  which is below the nasdaq minimum bid price requirement 
because our stock traded below per share for consecutive business days  on november  the nasdaq stock market notified us that we are no longer in compliance with marketplace rule c 
we were provided until may  to regain compliance 
in order to regain compliance  the bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days before that date 
if we cannot demonstrate compliance with rule c by may   the nasdaq staff will determine whether we meet the nasdaq capital market initial listing criteria set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule c  except for the bid price requirement 
if the nasdaq determines that we meet the initial listing criteria  the nasdaq staff will grant us an additional calendar day compliance period 
if we are not eligible for an additional compliance period  the nasdaq staff will provide written notice that our securities will be delisted 
at that time  we may appeal the determination to delist our securities to a listing qualifications panel 
a delisting of our shares could have a negative effect on the market price for our shares 
our reliance on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our revenues could materially harm our business and prospects 
relatively few customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our net sales 
in  our net sales to three companies constituted of our total net sales 
our customers generally do not enter into long term agreements obligating them to purchase our products 
we may not continue to receive significant revenues from any of these or from other large customers 
because of our significant customer concentration  our net sales and operating income could fluctuate significantly due to changes in political or economic conditions or the loss of  reduction of business with  or less favorable terms for any of our significant customers 
for example  in  dsl sales to our turkish distributor  one of our large customers  declined significantly from million in to million in we attribute this decline due to a number of factors including increased competition and plans by turkish telecom to dramatically increase their bundling of dsl modems with their service 
we cannot guarantee that we will increase our sales to our turkish distributor 
a reduction or delay in orders from any of our significant customers  or a delay or default in payment by any significant customer could materially harm our business  results of operation and liquidity 
our reliance on a single manufacturer for a substantial percentage of our products could have an adverse effect on our business 
we currently rely on a single manufacturer to manufacture a substantial portion of our products 
the loss of the services of this manufacturer or an adverse change in the manufacturer s business or our relationship could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture our products and on our business 
capacity constraints in our mexican operations could reduce our sales and revenues and hurt customer relationships 
we now rely on our mexican operations to finish and ship most of the products we sell 
since moving our manufacturing operations to our mexican facility we have experienced and may continue to experience constraints on our manufacturing capacity as we address challenges related to operating our new facility  such as hiring and training workers  creating the facility s infrastructure  developing new supplier relationships  complying with customs and border regulations  and resolving shipping and logistical issues 
our sales and revenues may be reduced and our customer relationships may be impaired if we continue to experience constraints on our manufacturing capacity 
we are working to minimize capacity constraints in a cost effective manner  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately minimize capacity constraints 
our reliance on a business processing outsourcing partner to conduct our operations in mexico could materially harm our business and prospects 
in connection with the move of most of our north american manufacturing operations to mexico  we rely on a business processing outsourcing partner to hire  subject to our oversight  the production team for our manufacturing operation  provide the selected facility described above  and coordinate many of the ongoing manufacturing logistics relating to our operations in mexico 
our outsourcing partner s related functions include acquiring the necessary mexican permits  providing the appropriate mexican operating entity  assisting in customs clearances  and providing other general assistance and administrative services in connection with the ongoing operation of the mexican facility 
our outsourcing partner s performance of these obligations efficiently and effectively is critical to the success of our operations in mexico 
failure of our outsourcing partner to perform its obligations efficiently and effectively could result in delays  unanticipated costs or interruptions in production  delays in deliveries to our customers or other harm to our business  results of operation  and liquidity 
moreover  if our outsourcing arrangement is not successful  we cannot assure our ability to find an alternative production facility or outsourcing partner to assist in our operations in mexico or our ability to operate successfully in mexico without outsourcing or similar assistance 
our net sales  operating results and liquidity have been and may in the future be adversely affected because of the decline in the retail market for dial up modems 
the dial up modem industry has been characterized by declining average selling prices and a declining retail market 
the decline in average selling prices is due to a number of factors  including technological change  lower component costs  and competition 
the decline in the size of the retail market for dial up modems is primarily due to the inclusion of dial up modems as a standard feature contained in new pcs  and the advent of broadband products 
decreasing average selling prices and reduced demand for our dial up modems have resulted and are likely to continue to result in decreased net sales for dial up modems 
if we fail to replace declining revenue from the sales of dial up modems with the sales of our other products  including our broadband modems  our business  results of operation and liquidity will be harmed 
less advantageous terms of sale of our products could harm our business 
we entered into a consignment arrangement with a significant retailer customer in october in connection with this arrangement ownership of all unsold products previously purchased from zoom reverted to us in november under the consignment arrangement we do not recognize revenue from the sale of a product until the retailer actually sells such product to its customer 
the consignment arrangement also results in a delay in the dating of invoices  the recognition of accounts receivable  and the due dates for payment by the retailer for goods sold 
if additional significant customers adopt similar arrangements or otherwise change the terms of sale  our business  results of operation and liquidity will be harmed 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to more successfully penetrate the broadband modem markets  which have been challenging markets  with significant barriers to entry 
with the shrinking of the dial up modem market  we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to more successfully penetrate the broadband modem markets  dsl and cable  and the voip market 
these markets have significant barriers to entry that have adversely affected our sales to these markets 
although some cable and dsl modems are sold at retail  the high volume purchasers of these modems are concentrated in a relatively few large cable  telecommunications  and internet service providers which offer broadband modem services to their customers 
these customers  particularly cable services providers  also have extensive and varied approval processes for modems to be approved for use on their network 
these approvals are expensive  time consuming  and continue to evolve 
successfully penetrating the broadband modem market therefore presents a number of challenges including the current limited retail market for broadband modems  the relatively small number of cable  telecommunications and internet service provider customers that make up the bulk of the market for broadband modems in certain countries  including the united states  the significant bargaining power of these large volume purchasers  the time consuming  expensive  uncertain and varied approval process of the various cable service providers  and the strong relationships with cable service providers enjoyed by incumbent cable equipment providers like motorola and cisco 
our sales of broadband products have been adversely affected by all of these factors 
sales of our broadband products in european countries have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to approvals and delays in the deployment by service providers of cable and dsl service in these countries 
we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully penetrate these markets 
our failure to meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards would adversely impact our ability to sell our products and services 
the market for pc communications products and high speed broadband access products and services is characterized by aggressive pricing practices  continually changing customer demand patterns  rapid technological advances  emerging industry standards and short product life cycles 
some of our product and service developments and enhancements have taken longer than planned and have delayed the availability of our products and services  which adversely affected our sales and profitability in the past 
any significant delays in the future may adversely impact our ability to sell our products and services  and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify and respond to emerging technological trends and industry standards in the market  develop and maintain competitive products that meet changing customer demands  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors  bring products to market on a timely basis  introduce products that have competitive prices  manage our product transitions  inventory levels and manufacturing processes efficiently  respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others  and meet changing industry standards 
our product cycles tend to be short  and we may incur significant non recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated 
therefore  the resources we devote to product development  sales and marketing may not generate material net sales for us 
in addition  short product cycles have resulted in and may in the future result in excess and obsolete inventory  which has had and may in the future have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
in an effort to develop innovative products and technology  we have incurred and may in the future incur substantial development  sales  marketing  and inventory costs 
if we are unable to recover these costs  our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions and we still have higher cost products in inventory  our business would be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks that could harm our business 
currently our business is significantly dependent on our operations outside the united states  particularly sales of our products and the production of most of our products 
all of our manufacturing operations except our rework operations are now located outside of the united states 
in  sales outside north america were of our net sales 
in  sales outside north america were of our net sales 
the inherent risks of international operations could harm our business  results of operation  and liquidity 
specifically  our manufacturing operations in mexico are subject to the challenges and risks associated with international operations  including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages  currency risk  and economic  legal  political and regulatory risks 
the types of risks faced in connection with international operations and sales include  among others regulatory and communications requirements and policy changes  favoritism toward local suppliers  delays in the rollout of broadband services by cable and dsl service providers outside of the united states  local language and technical support requirements  difficulties in inventory management  accounts receivable collection and the management of distributors or representatives  cultural differences  reduced control over staff and other difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  political and economic changes and disruptions  governmental currency controls  shipping costs  currency exchange rate fluctuations  including  as a result of the move of our manufacturing operations to mexico  changes in value of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar  and import  export  and tariff regulations 
we may be subject to product returns resulting from defects  or from overstocking of our products 
product returns could result in the failure to attain market acceptance of our products  which would harm our business 
if our products contain undetected defects  errors  or failures  we could face delays in the development of our products  numerous product returns  and other losses to us or to our customers or end users 
any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  either of which would reduce our sales and harm our business 
we are also exposed to the risk of product returns from our customers as a result of contractual stock rotation privileges and our practice of assisting some of our customers in balancing their inventories 
overstocking has in the past led and may in the future lead to higher than normal returns 
our failure to effectively manage our inventory levels could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and harm our business 
due to rapid technological change and changing markets we are required to manage our inventory levels carefully to both meet customer expectations regarding delivery times and to limit our excess inventory exposure 
in the event we fail to effectively manage our inventory our liquidity may be adversely affected and we may face increased risk of inventory obsolescence  a decline in market value of the inventory  or losses from theft  fire  or other casualty 
we did not incur a significant inventory obsolescence charge in for inventory reserves related to obsolete and slow moving products 
we may be unable to produce sufficient quantities of our products because we depend on third party manufacturers 
if these third party manufacturers fail to produce quality products in a timely manner  our ability to fulfill our customer orders would be adversely impacted 
we use contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers for electronics manufacturing of most of our products 
we use these third party manufacturers to help ensure low costs  rapid market entry  and reliability 
any manufacturing disruption could impair our ability to fulfill orders  and failure to fulfill orders would adversely affect our sales 
although we currently use four electronics manufacturers for the bulk of our purchases  in some cases a given product is only provided by one of these companies 
the loss of the services of any of our significant third party manufacturers or a material adverse change in the business of or our relationships with any of these manufacturers could harm our business 
since third parties manufacture our products and we expect this to continue in the future  our success will depend  in part  on the ability of third parties to manufacture our products cost effectively and in sufficient quantities to meet our customer demand 
we are subject to the following risks because of our reliance on third party manufacturers reduced management and control of component purchases  reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and manufacturing yields  lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  limited warranties on products supplied to us  potential increases in prices  interruption of supplies from assemblers as a result of a fire  natural calamity  strike or other significant event  and misappropriation of our intellectual property 
we may be unable to produce sufficient quantities of our products because we obtain key components from  and depend on  sole or limited source suppliers 
we obtain certain key parts  components  and equipment from sole or limited sources of supply 
for example  we purchase most of our dial up and broadband modem chipsets from conexant systems  agere systems  and ikanos communications 
integrated circuit product areas covered by at least one of these companies include dial up modems  dsl modems  cable modems  networking  routers  and gateways 
in the past we have experienced delays in receiving shipments of modem chipsets from our sole source suppliers 
we may experience similar delays in the future 
in addition  some products may have other components that are available from only one source 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components from our current sources  we would experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays or reductions in product shipments could damage relationships with our customers  and our customers could decide to purchase products from our competitors 
inability to meet our customers demand or a decision by one or more of our customers to purchase products from our competitors could harm our operating results 
we face significant competition  which could result in decreased demand for our products or services 
we may be unable to compete successfully 
a number of companies have developed  or are expected to develop  products that compete or will compete with our products 
furthermore  many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do 
intense competition  rapid technological change and evolving industry standards could result in less favorable selling terms to our customers  decrease demand for our products or make our products obsolete 
new environmental regulations may increase our manufacturing costs and harm our business 
the state of california and other states have implemented regulations requiring the use of highly efficient power cubes 
these new requirements will affect many of our products and will typically result in an increase of to in our cost to produce those products that use us power cubes 
this is expected to reduce our gross margin for those products 
changes in current or future laws or governmental regulations and industry standards that negatively impact our products  services and technologies could harm our business 
the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission  or the fcc  extends to the entire united states communications industry including our customers and their products and services that incorporate our products 
our products are also required to meet the regulatory requirements of other countries throughout the world where our products and services are sold 
obtaining government regulatory approvals is time consuming and very costly 
in the past  we have encountered delays in the introduction of our products  such as our cable modems  as a result of government certifications 
we may face further delays if we are unable to comply with governmental regulations 
delays caused by the time it takes to comply with regulatory requirements may result in cancellations or postponements of product orders or purchases by our customers  which would harm our business 
in addition to reliability and quality standards  the market acceptance of our voip products and services is dependent upon the adoption of industry standards so that products from multiple manufacturers are able to communicate with each other 
standards are continuously being modified and replaced 
as standards evolve  we may be required to modify our existing products or develop and support new versions of our products 
the failure of our products to comply  or delays in compliance  with various existing and evolving industry standards could delay or interrupt volume production of our products  which could harm our business 
regulation of voip services is developing and is therefore uncertain 
future regulation of voip services could increase our costs and restrict the growth of our voip business 
voip services currently have different regulations from traditional telephony in most countries including the us 
the us  various states and other countries may impose surcharges  taxes or new regulations upon providers of voip services 
the imposition of any such surcharges  taxes and regulations on voip services could materially increase our costs  may limit or eliminate our competitive pricing and may require us to restructure the voip services we currently offer 
for example  regulations requiring compliance with the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea or provision of the same type of services as required for traditional telecommunications providers could place a significant financial burden on us depending on the technical changes required to accommodate the requirements 
in many countries outside the us in which we operate or our services are sold  we cannot be certain that we will be able to comply with existing or future requirements  or that we will be able to continue to be in compliance with any such requirements 
our failure to comply with these requirements could materially adversely affect our ability to continue to offer our voip services in these jurisdictions 
fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
changes in currency exchange rates that increase the relative value of the us dollar may make it more difficult for us to compete with foreign manufacturers on price  may reduce our foreign currency denominated sales when expressed in dollars  or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results 
a significant increase in our foreign currency denominated sales would increase our risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
a weakness in the us dollar relative to the mexican peso and various asian currencies including the chinese renminbi could increase our product costs our future success will depend on the continued services of our executive officers and key product development personnel 
the loss of any of our executive officers or key product development personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring skilled personnel could harm our business 
competition for skilled personnel is significant 
we may be unable to attract and retain all the personnel necessary for the development of our business 
in addition  the loss of frank b 
manning  our president and chief executive officer  or some other member of the senior management team  a key engineer or salesperson  or other key contributors  could harm our relations with our customers  our ability to respond to technological change  and our business 
we may have difficulty protecting our intellectual property 
our ability to compete is heavily affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  patents  copyrights  trademarks  and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property 
the steps we take to protect our technology may be inadequate 
existing trade secret  trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection 
our patents could be invalidated or circumvented 
we have more intellectual property assets in some countries than we do in others 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
this may make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely 
we cannot ensure that the steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
particular aspects of our technology could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights or patents of others 
other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to our business 
we cannot predict the extent to which we may be required to seek licenses 
we cannot assure that the terms of any licenses we may be required to seek will be reasonable 
we are often indemnified by our suppliers relative to certain intellectual property rights  but these indemnifications do not cover all possible suits  and there is no guarantee that a relevant indemnification will be honored by the indemnifying party
