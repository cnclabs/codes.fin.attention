the following discussions and those later in the document on operating income and segment results include use of the term gross margin 
gross margin is determined by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue 
cost of sales includes the purchased gas cost for natural gas and propane and the cost of labor spent on direct revenue producing activities 
gross margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income  which are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
chesapeake believes that gross margin  although a non gaap measure  is useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions 
it provides investors with information that demonstrates the profitability achieved by the company under its allowed rates for regulated operations and under its competitive pricing structure for non regulated segments 
chesapeake s management uses gross margin in measuring its business units performance and has historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly 
other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner 
operating income a strong year over year increase in operating income for was attained from the company s natural gas  propane  and advanced information services business segments 
percentage in thousands change change natural gas propane advanced information services other eliminations total operating income the natural gas segment benefited from the additional transportation capacity contracts implemented by eastern shore  continued customer growth from the distribution operations  rate increases  and the impact of colder temperatures on the delmarva peninsula that were percent colder in than in the propane segment benefited from the colder temperatures on the delmarva peninsula and also from the volatility in wholesale propane prices experienced in key financial and operational highlights for fiscal year include the following new transportation capacity contracts implemented by eastern shore in november provided for  dts of firm transportation capacity per day and contributed million of additional gross margin in on august   eastern shore received authorization from the ferc to commence construction of a portion of the phase ii facilities approximately miles of the expansion project 
these additional facilities  which were completed and placed in service on november  provide for  dts of additional firm capacity per day generating annualized gross margin of million 
the base rate increase that the company received from the maryland psc on september   for our maryland natural gas operations  contributed  of additional gross margin in page effective september   the ferc authorized eastern shore to commence the billing of increased rates agreed to in a settlement with its customers  which the ferc formally approved in january these increased rates provided for an additional  of gross margin in on august   the delaware psc authorized the company to implement temporary rates with its customers  subject to refund  pending the completion of full evidentiary hearings and a final decision by the delaware psc 
customer growth in the natural gas and propane businesses remained strong  with the delmarva and florida natural gas distribution operations registering seven and five percent increases in residential customers  respectively  and the delmarva community gas systems cgs generating a percent increase in propane distribution customers 
for the year ended december   the company generated million in operating cash attributed to net income of million and million in net cash from other operating activities  which includes million in depreciation and amortization 
the company continued to invest in property  plant and equipment to support current and future growth opportunities and utilized million of cash in for such expenditures 
the company s financial performance is discussed in greater detail below in results of operations 
critical accounting policies chesapeake prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
application of these accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingencies during the reporting period 
chesapeake bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
most of chesapeake s businesses are regulated  accordingly  the accounting methods used by these businesses must comply with the requirements of the regulatory bodies  therefore  the choices available are limited by these regulatory requirements 
in the normal course of business  estimated amounts are subsequently adjusted to actual results that may differ from estimates 
management believes that the following policies require significant estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies and their application have been discussed with chesapeake s audit committee 
regulatory assets and liabilities as a result of the ratemaking process  chesapeake records certain assets and liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and consequently  the accounting principles applied by our regulated utilities differ in certain respects from those applied by the unregulated businesses 
costs are deferred when there is a probable expectation that they will be recovered in future revenues as a result of the regulatory process 
as more fully described in note a to the consolidated financial statements  chesapeake had recorded regulatory assets of million and regulatory liabilities of million  at december  if the company were required to terminate application of sfas no 
 it would be required to recognize all such deferred amounts as a charge or a credit to earnings  net of applicable income taxes 
such an adjustment could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
valuation of environmental assets and liabilities as more fully described in note m to the financial statements  chesapeake has completed its responsibilities related to one environmental site and is currently participating in the investigation  assessment or remediation of three other former manufactured gas plant sites 
amounts have been recorded as environmental liabilities and associated environmental regulatory assets based on estimates of future costs provided by independent consultants 
there is uncertainty in these amounts because the environmental protection agency epa or applicable state environmental authority may not have selected the final remediation methods 
in addition  there is uncertainty with regard to amounts that may be recovered from other potentially responsible parties 
since the company s management believes that recovery of these expenditures  including any litigation costs  is probable through the regulatory process  the company has recorded  in accordance with sfas  a regulatory asset and corresponding regulatory liability 
at december   chesapeake had recorded an environmental regulatory asset of  and a regulatory liability of  for over collections and an additional liability of  for environmental costs 
derivatives chesapeake may use derivative instruments to manage the price risk of its natural gas and propane purchasing activities 
the use of these instruments is subject to the company s risk management policies  which are continually monitored for compliance 
derivative instruments utilized in connection with these activities and services are accounted in accordance with sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  under which chesapeake either records the fair value of derivatives held as assets and liabilities 
if the derivative contracts meets the normal purchase and normal sale scope exception of sfas  the related activities and services are accounted on an accrual basis of accounting 
the following is a review of chesapeake s derivative activity at december  and the natural gas distribution and marketing operations entered into physical contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas 
these physical contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception under sfas at december  and in that they provide for the purchase or sale of natural gas that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the company over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
accordingly  they are not subject to the accounting requirements of sfas no 
during and  chesapeake s propane distribution operations entered into physical contracts to buy propane supplies 
these contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception under sfas in that they provide for the purchase or sale of propane that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the company over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
accordingly  the related liabilities incurred and assets acquired under these contracts are recorded when title to the underlying commodity passes 
during  the propane distribution operation had entered into a swap agreement to protect the company from the impact of price increases on our price cap plan that we offer to customers 
the company considered this agreement to be an economic hedge that did not qualify for hedge accounting as described in sfas at the end of the period  the market price of propane dropped below the unit price within the swap agreement 
as a result of the price drop  the company marked the agreement to market  which resulted in an unrealized loss in of  the company did not enter into a similar swap agreement in chesapeake s propane wholesale marketing operation enters into forward and futures contracts that are considered derivatives under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in accordance with that pronouncement  open positions are marked to market prices at the end of each reporting period and unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statement of income as revenue 
the contracts all mature within one year and are almost exclusively for propane commodities  with delivery points of mt 
belvieu  texas  conway  kansas  and hattiesburg  mississippi 
management estimates the market valuation based on references to exchange traded futures prices  historical differentials and actual trading activity at the end of the reporting period 
at december   these contracts had net unrealized gains of  that were recorded in the financial statements 
at december   these contracts had net unrealized gains of  that were recorded in the financial statements 
commodity price volatility may have a significant impact on the gain or loss in any given period 
page operating revenues revenues for the natural gas distribution operations of the company are based on rates approved by the pscs of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the natural gas transmission operation s revenues are based on rates approved by the ferc 
customers base rates may not be changed without formal approval by these commissions 
however  the regulatory authorities have granted the company s regulated natural gas distribution operations the ability to negotiate rates  based on approved methodologies  with customers that have competitive alternatives 
in addition  the natural gas transmission operation can negotiate rates above or below the ferc approved tariff rates 
for regulated deliveries of natural gas  chesapeake reads meters and bills customers on monthly cycles that do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
chesapeake accrues unbilled revenues for gas that has been delivered  but not yet billed at the end of an accounting period to the extent that they do not coincide 
in connection with this accrual  chesapeake must estimate the amount of gas that has not been accounted for on its delivery system and must estimate the amount of the unbilled revenue by jurisdiction and customer class 
a similar computation is made to accrue unbilled revenues for propane customers with meters  such as community gas system customers 
the propane wholesale marketing operation records trading activity  on a net mark to market basis in the company s income statement  for open contracts 
the propane distribution  advanced information services and other segments record revenue in the period the products are delivered and or services are rendered 
chesapeake s natural gas distribution operations in delaware and maryland each have a purchased gas cost recovery mechanism 
this mechanism provides the company with a method of adjusting the billing rates with its customers for changes in the cost of purchased gas included in base rates 
the difference between the current cost of gas purchased and the cost of gas recovered in billed rates is deferred and accounted for as either unrecovered purchased gas costs or amounts payable to customers 
generally  these deferred amounts are recovered or refunded within one year 
the company charges flexible rates to the natural gas distribution s industrial interruptible customers to make them competitive with alternative types of fuel 
based on pricing  these customers can choose natural gas or alternative fuels 
neither the company nor the interruptible customer is contractually obligated to deliver or receive natural gas 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect based upon our collections experiences and our assessment of our customers inability or reluctance to pay 
if circumstances change  however  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable may also change 
circumstances which could affect our estimates include  but are not limited to  customer credit issues  the level of natural gas prices and general economic conditions 
accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible

natural gas transmission the natural gas transmission operation achieved gross margin growth of million  or percent  in compared to of the million increase  million was attributable to new transportation capacity contracts implemented in november and in  the new transportation capacity contracts implemented in november are expected to generate an additional annual gross margin of million above gross margins 
in addition  the implementation of rate case settlement rates  effective september   contributed an additional  to gross margins in a further discussion of the ferc rate proceeding is provided in detail within the regulatory activities listed later in this section 
the remaining  increase to gross margin in is attributable to other factors  such as higher interruptible sales 
an increase of million in other operating expenses partially offset the increased gross margin 
the factors contributing to the increase in other operating expenses are as follow payroll and benefit costs increased by  and  respectively  as the operation increased its staffing levels to comply with new federal pipeline integrity regulations and to serve the additional growth 
the new pipeline integrity regulations require the company to assess the integrity of each covered segment of its line pipe 
these regulations require the assessment of at least percent of the covered segments by december  and completion of the baseline assessment of all covered segments by december  eastern shore also incurred an additional  of third party costs in compared to to comply with the new federal pipeline integrity regulations previously discussed 
the increased level of capital investment caused higher depreciation and asset removal costs of  and increased property taxes of corporate costs increased  as the company updated its annual corporate cost allocations based on a methodology accepted by the ferc 
the increase in operating expenses for is magnified by the ferc s authorization  in july  to defer certain pre service costs of eastern shore s e project  allowing the company to treat such costs as a regulatory asset

the company does not expect to maintain the growth rate of residential customers  which it has experienced in the past few years 
the company has seen a slow down in the new housing market in as a result of unfavorable market conditions in the housing industry  which include a increased new and resale home inventory levels  b decreased homebuyer demand due to lower consumer confidence in the overall housing market  c increased uncertainty in the overall mortgage market  and d increased underwriting standards

this variance occurred as a result of the season or month that the heating degree day variance occurred 
the colder temperatures did not have a significant impact on the maryland distribution operation s gross margin in  because the operation s approved rate structure now includes a weather normalization adjustment wna mechanism  which was implemented in october and is designed to protect a portion of the company s revenues against warmer than normal weather  as deviations from normal weather can affect our financial performance 
the wna also serves to offset the impact of colder than normal weather on our customers by reducing the amounts the company can charge them during such periods

the company can store up to approximately four million gallons including leased storage and rail cars of propane during the winter season to meet its customers peak requirements and to serve metered customers 
decreases in the wholesale price of propane may cause the value of stored propane to decline 
to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations  the company has adopted a risk management policy that allows the propane distribution operation to enter into fair value hedges of its inventory 
management reviewed the company s storage position as of december   and elected not to hedge any of its inventories 
at december   the propane distribution operation had entered into a swap agreement to protect the company from the impact of price increases on the price cap plan that we offer to customers 
the company considered this agreement to be an economic hedge that did not qualify for hedge accounting as described in sfas at the end of  the market price of propane dropped below the unit price within the swap agreement 
as a result of the price drop  the company marked the agreement to market  which resulted in an unrealized loss of  the company did not enter into a similar agreement in the company s propane wholesale marketing operation is a party to natural gas liquids ngl forward contracts  primarily propane contracts  with various third parties 
these contracts require that the propane wholesale marketing operation purchase or sell ngl at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of ngl to the company or the counter party or booking out the transaction 
booking out is a procedure for financially settling a contract in lieu of the physical delivery of energy 
the propane wholesale marketing operation also enters into futures contracts that are traded on the new york mercantile exchange 
in certain cases  the futures contracts are settled by the payment or receipt of a net amount equal to the difference between the current market price of the futures contract and the original contract price  however  they may also be settled by physical receipt or delivery of propane 
the forward and futures contracts are entered into for trading and wholesale marketing purposes 
the propane wholesale marketing business is subject to commodity price risk on its open positions to the extent that market prices for ngl deviate from fixed contract settlement prices 
market risk associated with the trading of futures and forward contracts is monitored daily for compliance with the company s risk management policy  which includes volumetric limits for open positions 
to manage exposures to changing market prices  open positions are marked up or down to market prices and reviewed by the company s oversight officials daily 
in addition  the risk management committee reviews periodic reports on market and the credit risk of counter parties  approves any exceptions to the risk management policy within limits established by the board of directors and authorizes the use of any new types of contracts 
quantitative information on forward and futures contracts at december  and is presented in the following tables 
at december  quantity in gallons estimated market prices weighted average contract prices forward contracts sale purchase estimated market prices and weighted average contract prices are in dollars per gallon 
all contracts expire in quantity estimated weighted average at december  in gallons market prices contract prices forward contracts sale purchase estimated market prices and weighted average contract prices are in dollars per gallon 
all contracts expired in the company s natural gas distribution and marketing operations have entered into agreements with natural gas suppliers to purchase natural gas for resale to their customers 
purchases under these contracts either do not meet the definition of derivatives in sfas no 
or are considered normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
and are not marked to market 
page competition the company s natural gas operations compete with other forms of energy including electricity  oil and propane 
the principal competitive factors are price and  to a lesser extent  accessibility 
the company s natural gas distribution operations have several large volume industrial customers that can use fuel oil as an alternative to natural gas 
when oil prices decline  these interruptible customers may convert to oil to satisfy their fuel requirements 
lower levels of interruptible sales may occur when oil prices are lower than the price of natural gas 
oil prices  as well as the prices of electricity and other fuels  are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons  therefore  future competitive conditions are not predictable 
to address this uncertainty  the company uses flexible pricing arrangements on both the supply and sales sides of this business to compete with the fluctuations in its customers alternative fuel prices 
as a result of the transmission operation s conversion to open access and the florida gas distribution division s restructuring of its services  their businesses have shifted from providing bundled transportation and sales service to providing only transportation and contract storage services 
the company s natural gas distribution operations in delaware  maryland and florida offer unbundled transportation services to certain commercial and industrial customers 
in  the florida operation extended such service to residential customers 
with such transportation service available on the company s distribution systems  the company is competing with third party suppliers to sell gas to industrial customers 
with respect to unbundled transportation services  the company s competitors include interstate transmission companies  if the distribution customers are located close enough to a transmission company s pipeline to make connections economically feasible 
the customers at risk are usually large volume commercial and industrial customers with the financial resources and capability to bypass the company s distribution operations in this manner 
in certain situations  the company s distribution operations may adjust services and rates for these customers to retain their business 
the company expects to continue to expand the availability of transportation service to additional classes of distribution customers in the future 
the company established a natural gas sales and supply operation in florida to compete for customers eligible for transportation services 
the company also provides such sales service in delaware 
the company s propane distribution operations compete with several other propane distributors in their service territories  primarily on the basis of service and price  emphasizing reliability of service and responsiveness 
competition is generally from local outlets of national distribution companies and local businesses because distributors located in close proximity to customers incur lower costs of providing service 
propane competes with electricity as an energy source  because it is typically less expensive than electricity  based on equivalent btu value 
propane also competes with home heating oil as an energy source 
since natural gas has historically been less expensive than propane  propane is generally not distributed in geographic areas served by natural gas pipeline or distribution systems 
the propane wholesale marketing operation competes against various regional and national marketers  many of which have significantly greater resources and are able to obtain price or volumetric advantages 
the advanced information services business faces significant competition from a number of larger competitors having substantially greater resources available to them than does the company 
in addition  changes in the advanced information services business are occurring rapidly  which could adversely affect the markets for the products and services offered by these businesses 
this segment competes on the basis of technological expertise  reputation and price 
inflation inflation affects the cost of supply  labor  products and services required for operations  maintenance and capital improvements 
while the impact of inflation has remained low in recent years  natural gas and propane prices are subject to rapid fluctuations 
in the company s regulated natural gas distribution operations  fluctuations in natural gas prices are passed on to customers through the gas cost recovery mechanism in the company s tariffs 
to help cope with the effects of inflation on its capital investments and returns  the company seeks rate relief from regulatory commissions for its regulated operations and closely monitors the returns of its unregulated business operations 
to compensate for fluctuations in propane gas prices  the company adjusts its propane selling prices to the extent allowed by the market
