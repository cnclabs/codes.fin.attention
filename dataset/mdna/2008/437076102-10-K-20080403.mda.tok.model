on august   we closed the sale of hd supply 
we received net proceeds of billion for the sale of hd supply and recognized a loss of million  net of tax  for the sale of the business 
hd supply is being reported as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented 
we reported earnings from continuing operations of billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of for fiscal compared to earnings from continuing operations of billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of for fiscal net sales decreased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal our gross profit margin was and our operating margin was for fiscal fiscal consisted of weeks compared with weeks for fiscal the rd week added approximately billion in net sales and increased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately for fiscal the slowdown in the residential construction and home improvement markets negatively affected our net sales for fiscal our comparable store sales declined in fiscal driven by a decline in comparable store customer transactions  as well as a decline in our average ticket to 
we believe the residential construction and home improvement market will remain soft in we expect our net sales to decline by to and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to decline by approximately to for fiscal we remain committed to the long term health of our business through our strategy of investing in our retail business through the following five key priorities associate engagement we have taken a number of actions to improve associate engagement by changing the way our associates are compensated  recognized and rewarded  including restructuring our success sharing program  an incentive program for our hourly associates driven by individual store performance 
as of the end of fiscal  of our stores were eligible to receive a success sharing payout for the second half of fiscal compared to of stores for the same period last year 
we also launched a program earlier this year to hire master trade specialists to bring electrical and plumbing experience and know how to the stores and to transfer knowledge to other associates 
we now have over  master trade specialists in our stores 
product excitement in fiscal  we accelerated clearance markdowns to sell through existing product in order to make room for new merchandise as we launched our enhanced product line review process and in support of merchandising reset activities 
we gained market share in paint  appliances and power tools in fiscal through the addition of new styles and color choices and by enhancing our product displays 
in areas where we have completed our merchandising resets and implemented change from our product line review process  collectively these categories are outperforming store sales performance in line with our expectations 
shopping environment we continued our store reinvestment program by completing an aggressive list of maintenance projects  including new lighting and basic clean up activities for over half of our stores  as well as more complex repair and maintenance activities for hundreds of other stores 
in addition to programmatic maintenance  our integrated field and support center teams have rolled out store standards to all stores 
we developed and piloted common guidelines on store appearance and shopability  including standards for front apron merchandising  wingstack usage  signage presentation  fixturing and off shelf product 
this initiative helps reduce the amount of time our store managers spend on these issues  removes unnecessary clutter from the aisles and implements a basic consistent approach in terms of appearance 
product availability we are in the early stages of our supply chain transformation to improve product availability 
we have improved management of our in stock position  implemented enhancements to our replenishment systems and begun a rollout of a new warehouse management system 
we also implemented a pilot of our rapid deployment centers 
optimally  more volume will pass through the rapid deployment centers than through our traditional distribution centers 
own the pro we have made significant improvements in the services we provide our pro customers  particularly through our pro bid room 
the pro bid room  which is available in all of our stores  allows us to leverage the buying power of the home depot for the benefit of our pro customers 
our direct ship program allows us to have large orders delivered from our vendors to the customer s job site directly  reducing handling  lead time and cost while building loyalty with the pro customer 
we opened new stores in fiscal  including relocations  bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal to  as of the end of fiscal   or approximately  of our stores were located in canada  mexico or china compared to as of fiscal we generated billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal we used this cash flow  along with the net proceeds from the sale of hd supply  to fund billion of share repurchases  including billion used to repurchase million shares of our common stock in connection with our tender offer  and billion of cash dividends 
we also spent billion in capital expenditures 
at the end of fiscal  our long term debt to equity ratio was compared to at the end of fiscal our return on invested capital for continuing operations computed on the average of beginning and ending long term debt and equity for the trailing twelve months was at the end of fiscal compared to for fiscal we believe the selected sales data  the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below is important in evaluating the performance of our business operations

results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this report 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales fiscal consisted of weeks compared to weeks in fiscal net sales for fiscal decreased  or billion  to billion from billion for fiscal the decrease in net sales for fiscal reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales  partially offset by net sales of billion for fiscal from new stores and billion of net sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal comparable store sales decreased for fiscal compared to a decrease of for fiscal there were a number of factors that contributed to our comparable store sales decline 
the residential construction and home improvement markets continued to be soft  especially in some of our traditionally strong markets such as florida  california and the northeast 
we saw relative strength in flooring  plumbing  garden  and paint as comparable store sales in these areas were above the company average for fiscal we gained market share in power tools and equipment  due in part to our launch of ryobi one lithium products in fiscal comparable store sales for lumber  building materials  hardware  lighting  kitchen bath and millwork were below the company average for fiscal the combination of softness in our big ticket categories and commodity price deflation negatively impacted average ticket  which decreased to for fiscal our international business performed well in fiscal our mexican stores posted a double digit comparable store sales increase for fiscal  and canada s comparable store sales were also positive 
in order to meet our customer service objectives  we strategically open stores near market areas served by existing stores cannibalize to enhance service levels  gain incremental sales and increase market penetration 
our new stores cannibalized approximately of our existing stores as of the end of fiscal  which had a negative impact to comparable store sales of approximately 
we believe that our sales performance has been  and could continue to be  negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets 
due to the highly fragmented us home improvement industry  in which we estimate our market share is approximately  measuring the impact on our sales by our competitors is difficult 
gross profit gross profit decreased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal gross profit as a percent of net sales was for fiscal  flat compared to fiscal lower deferred interest costs associated with our private label credit card financing programs provided a benefit of basis points to gross profit as a percent of net sales for fiscal through our private label credit card  we offer no interest no payment programs 
the cost of deferred interest associated with these programs is included in cost of sales 
for fiscal  the penetration of our private label and co branded credit sales was compared to for fiscal the deferred interest benefit was mostly offset by a higher penetration of lower margin products such as appliances and markdowns taken to clear through some seasonal items  such as outdoor power equipment and grills  and to allow us to transition into new products  such as assembled cabinets and kitchen accessories 
operating expenses operating expenses increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal operating expenses as a percent of net sales were for fiscal compared to for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal as a percent of net sales  sg a was for fiscal compared to for fiscal our deleverage in sg a reflects the impact of negative comparable store sales  where for every one percentage point of negative comparable store sales  we expect to deleverage expenses by about basis points 
additionally in fiscal  our profit sharing with the third party administrator of the private label credit card portfolio was million less than what we received in fiscal we account for profit sharing as a reduction in operating expense 
we also recognized million of write offs associated with certain future store locations that we determined we will not open and million of expense associated with closing our home depot landscape supply stores and our tampa call center in fiscal sg a also reflects investments we are making in support of our five key priorities 
as a percentage of net sales  total payroll increased by basis points for fiscal over the same period last year 
this reflects investments in store labor and our master trade specialists program  the impact of our success sharing bonus plans  as well as the negative sales environment 
the increase in sg a for fiscal over fiscal was partially offset by million of executive severance recorded in fiscal depreciation and amortization increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was for fiscal and for fiscal the increase as a percent of net sales was primarily due to the depreciation of our investments in store modernization and technology 
operating income operating income decreased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal operating income as a percent of net sales was for fiscal compared to for fiscal interest  net in fiscal  we recognized million of net interest expense compared to million in fiscal net interest expense as a percent of net sales was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase was primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the december issuance of million of floating rate senior notes  billion of senior notes and billion of senior notes 
provision for income taxes our combined federal and state effective income tax rate for continuing operations decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal reflects the impact of a one time retroactive tax assessment received from the canadian province of quebec in the second quarter of fiscal and tax benefits recognized upon settlement of several state audits and completion of the fiscal and federal tax audits in fiscal diluted earnings per share from continuing operations diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were for fiscal and for fiscal the rd week increased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately for fiscal diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were favorably impacted in both fiscal and by the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our billion repurchase authorization 
we repurchased million shares for billion in fiscal and million shares for billion in fiscal since the inception of the program in  we have repurchased million shares of our common stock for a total of billion 
as of february   we had billion remaining under our authorized share repurchase program 
discontinued operations discontinued operations consist of the results of operations through august  and a loss on the sale of hd supply 
net sales from discontinued operations were billion for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal earnings from discontinued operations  net of tax  were million for fiscal  compared to million for last year 
earnings from discontinued operations for fiscal include a million loss  net of tax  recognized on the sale of the business 
fiscal compared to fiscal year ended january  fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal increased  or billion  to billion from billion for fiscal fiscal net sales growth was primarily driven by net sales of billion from new stores 
comparable store sales decreased for fiscal compared to an increase of for fiscal the decline in comparable store sales was driven by a decline in comparable store customer transactions offset in part by a increase in average ticket 
our average ticket increased to for fiscal and increased in of selling departments 
the decrease in comparable store sales for fiscal was due to the significant slowdown in the us retail home improvement market as well as difficult year over year comparisons due to sales arising from hurricane activity in fiscal both canada and mexico experienced positive comparable store sales for fiscal additionally  our comparable store sales results reflect in part the impact of cannibalization 
our new stores cannibalized approximately of our existing stores during fiscal  which had a negative impact to comparable store sales of approximately 
gross profit gross profit increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased basis points to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decline in gross profit as a percent of net sales reflects a changing mix of products sold primarily due to growth in appliances whose margin rate is below the company average 
operating expenses operating expenses increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal operating expenses as a percent of net sales were for fiscal compared to for fiscal sg a increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal as a percent of net sales  sg a was for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in sg a during fiscal was due to added associate labor hours on the floor of our stores  increased spending on store maintenance programs and the expansion of merchandise display resets 
this increase was partially offset by reduced self insurance costs as we continue to realize benefits from safety programs and other initiatives 
also in fiscal  we received more benefits under our profit sharing provision with the third party administrator of the private label credit card portfolio than in fiscal also impacting our sg a in fiscal was expense associated with executive severance of million and the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  whereby we recorded approximately million of stock compensation expense related to the continued vesting of options granted prior to fiscal partially offsetting the increase in sg a was million of impairment charges and expense related to lease obligations associated with the closing of expo design center stores in fiscal depreciation and amortization increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was for fiscal and for fiscal the increase as a percent of net sales was primarily due to the depreciation of our investments in store modernization and technology 
operating income operating income decreased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal operating income as a percent of net sales was for fiscal and for fiscal interest  net in fiscal  we recognized million of net interest expense compared to million in fiscal net interest expense as a percent of net sales was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase was primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the march issuance of billion of senior notes and billion of senior notes and the december issuance of million of floating rate senior notes  billion of senior notes and billion of senior notes 
provision for income taxes our combined federal  state and foreign effective income tax rate increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal was primarily due to the impact of a retroactive tax assessment from the canadian province of quebec 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the quebec national assembly passed legislation that retroactively changed certain tax laws that subjected us to additional tax and interest 
as a result  we received an assessment from quebec for million in retroactive tax and million in related interest for the through taxable years 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were for fiscal and for fiscal diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were favorably impacted in both fiscal and fiscal by the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow generated from operations provides a significant source of liquidity 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was billion as compared to billion for fiscal this change was primarily a result of decreased net earnings and changes in working capital 
investing activities provided billion for fiscal compared to billion used in investing activities for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of billion of net proceeds from the sale of hd supply in the third quarter of fiscal and billion less in payments for businesses acquired in fiscal the sale of hd supply principally resulted in reductions in the following balance sheet accounts receivables  merchandise inventories  goodwill  other assets  accounts payable and accrued salaries and related expenses 
additionally in fiscal  we spent billion on capital expenditures  allocated as follows for new stores  for store modernization  for technology and for other initiatives 
of the billion in capital expenditures approximately billion was for retail operations 
in fiscal  we added new stores  including relocations 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was billion compared with million for fiscal the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to billion more in common stock share repurchases than last year  including the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for billion in connection with our tender offer  along with billion less in proceeds from borrowings of long term debt in fiscal on june   the board of directors authorized a recapitalization of the company  including an additional billion in common stock repurchases 
we closed the sale of hd supply on august  and used the proceeds from the sale and cash on hand to repurchase million shares of our common stock for billion  or per share  in settlement of a related tender offer 
in november  we retired million shares of our treasury stock 
since the inception of our share repurchase program in  we have repurchased million shares of our common stock for a total of billion 
as of february   billion remained under our share repurchase authorization 
we anticipate issuing debt to complete the remainder of our recapitalization plan 
we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to billion 
in connection with the programs  we have a back up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to billion 
as of february   there was billion outstanding under the commercial paper programs and there were no borrowings outstanding under the related credit facility 
we do not foresee borrowings under the commercial paper programs beyond the billion back up credit facility 
the credit facility  which expires in december  contains various restrictive covenants  all of which we are in compliance with 
none of the covenants are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 
we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate  including our stores  distribution centers and store support centers 
the net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in long term debt 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of the end of fiscal  our long term debt to equity ratio was compared to at the end of fiscal this increase reflects the net increase in long term debt as a result of the december issuance of million of floating rate senior notes  billion of senior notes and billion of senior notes 
as of february   we had million in cash and short term investments 
we believe that our current cash position and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and any required long term debt payments through the next several fiscal years 
in addition  we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing for other requirements 
during fiscal  we entered into interest rate swaps  accounted for as fair value hedges  with notional amounts of billion that swap fixed rate interest on our billion senior notes for variable rate interest equal to libor plus to basis points that expire on march  at february   the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of million  which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle similar interest rate swap agreements at current interest rates 
also during fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap  accounted for as a cash flow hedge  with a notional amount of million that swaps variable rate interest on our million floating rate senior notes for fixed rate interest at that expires on december  at february   the approximate fair value of this agreement was a liability of million  which is the estimated amount we would have paid to settle similar interest rate swap agreements at current interest rates 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of february  amounts in millions payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations total thereafter total debt      capital lease obligations  operating leases     purchase obligations    fin unrecognized tax benefits total      excludes present value of capital lease obligations of million 
includes billion of interest payments and million of unamortized discount 
includes million of imputed interest 
purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases  utility purchases  capital expenditures  software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts 
purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above 
excludes million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments related to the fin liabilities 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates 
although we have international operating entities  our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition and results of operations 
our primary objective for entering into derivative instruments is to manage our exposure to interest rates  as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
as of february  we had  net of discounts  billion of senior notes outstanding 
the market values of the publicly traded senior notes as of february   were approximately billion 
impact of inflation  deflation and changing prices we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products 
we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations 
although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations  we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of estimated returns and sales tax  at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services 
we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels 
we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns 
we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns 
however  if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts  our sales could be adversely impacted 
when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed  the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is complete 
we also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in net sales 
merchandise inventories our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market  with approximately valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under the cost method 
retailers like the home depot  with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions  frequently use the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  merchandise inventories are stated at cost  which is determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories 
as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions  our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate our inventory valued under the cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under the cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal or independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated 
during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores  we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store by store basis 
shrink or in the case of excess inventory  swell is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory 
shrink may occur due to theft  loss  inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods  among other things 
we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories 
the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business 
actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal  or self insurance we are self insured for certain losses related to general liability  product liability  automobile  workers compensation and medical claims 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and is reviewed by management and third party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  medical cost inflation  or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates  our results of operations could be impacted 
actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal  or vendor allowances vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels 
these vendor allowances are accrued as earned  with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases 
we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 
volume rebates and advertising co op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold 
certain advertising co op allowances that are reimbursements of specific  incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets when management makes the decision to relocate or close a store or other location  or when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
a store s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value 
if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  a provision is made to write down the related assets to fair value if the carrying value is greater than the fair value 
we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long lived assets 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual results differ from our estimates  our results of operations could be impacted 
impairment losses are recorded as a component of sg a in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
when a location closes  we also recognize in sg a the net present value of future lease obligations  less estimated sublease income 
in fiscal  we recorded million in sg a related to asset impairment charges and on going lease obligations associated with closing expo design center stores 
additionally  we recorded million of expense in cost of sales in fiscal related to inventory markdowns in these stores 
we also recorded impairments on other closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business  which were not material to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal  and recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and will therefore be effective for the home depot in fiscal implementation of sfas as it relates to the fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in an entity s financial statements on a recurring basis  has been deferred to fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of sfas in fiscal is not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition of the company
