item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
the book values of cash equivalents  short and long term investments  accounts receivable  and accounts payable are considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments 
as of march   we had  in cash and cash equivalents   in short term investments and  in long term investments 
a majority of our cash and cash equivalents and investments generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates 
a significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income generated from our excess cash and investments 
it would also impact the market value of our investments 
our investments are subject to market risk  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
our investments are managed by a limited number of outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by our board of directors 
such guidelines include security type  credit quality  and maturity  and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with both short and long term maturities 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant market risk 
at march   we had no debt obligations
