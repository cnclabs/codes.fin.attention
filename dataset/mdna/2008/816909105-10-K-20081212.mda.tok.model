item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  install and service highly engineered equipment for use in the fabrication of semiconductor devices 
our products are focused on the wet chemical process steps in integrated circuit  or ic  manufacturing and include systems for wafer surface preparation and electrochemical deposition  or ecd  applications 
our surface preparation systems are designed for front end of line feol  back end of line beol and wafer level packaging of ics processes 
our single wafer feol surface preparation systems are used for photoresist stripping  post etch and pre diffusion cleans 
our beol surface preparation systems are used for polymer removal and packaging applications 
our ecd systems are used to plate copper and other metals  which are used for the ic s internal wiring  or interconnects  to plate solder and lead free solder bumps for wafer level packaging applications  and to plate other metals for various semiconductor and related applications 
also  our surface preparation systems are used for cleaning and etching processes for wafer level packaging 
our primary product for all of these processes is the raider platform  which is a multi chamber single wafer tool 
our products address critical applications within the semiconductor manufacturing process  and help enable our customers to manufacture more advanced semiconductor devices that feature higher levels of performance 
the fabrication of semiconductor devices typically requires several hundred manufacturing steps  with the number of steps continuing to increase for advanced devices 
due to the breadth of our product portfolio and advanced technology capabilities  our solutions address over of these manufacturing steps 
there are several key trends in the semiconductor manufacturing industry driving growth in demand for wafer surface preparation  ecd and other advanced semiconductor equipment smaller device features for lower cost and higher performance  new materials to fabricate more advanced semiconductor devices  move to single wafer processing technologies for enhanced surface preparation  wafer level and other advanced packaging to enable smaller portable products  and emerging need for d chipstacking driven by the demand for smaller portable devices 
as the semiconductor manufacturing process increases in complexity and production parameters become even more stringent  semiconductor manufacturers increasingly rely upon manufacturers of semiconductor equipment to achieve improved process control  provide a smaller equipment footprint and lower the cost of ownership of their manufacturing processes 
key elements of our solution include technological leadership  a comprehensive product portfolio  including our raider platform and vertically integrated manufacturing and design capabilities 
key performance indicators our management focuses on revenues  gross margin  operating expenses and profitability in managing our business 
in addition to these financial measures found in our consolidated financial statements  we also use bookings  backlog  shipments  deferred revenue and shipment based results of operations 
bookings are firm orders for which we have received written customer authorization in the fiscal period 
backlog is the balance of undelivered orders at the end of a fiscal period 
in order to be included in bookings or backlog  an order must be scheduled to ship within the next months 
backlog and forecasted orders drive our production schedule 
shipments measure how well we have met our production plan and are viewed as a primary measure of factory output 
deferred revenue primarily represents tool shipments for which we are awaiting final customer acceptance 
a summary of key factors that impacted our financial performance during fiscal year includes although the semiconductor industry experienced a downturn in fiscal  our business grew as we penetrated key customers in asia and north america 
even though capital spending slowed among several major device manufacturers  demand remained strong for wafer level packaging and copper plating for memory applications 
in the first quarter of fiscal  there were severe disruptions in the world economies which we expect to negatively impact us going forward 
our fiscal bookings were million and include million in bookings for our raider platform 
fourth quarter fiscal net bookings were million and were negatively impacted by the cancellation of a large order related to a proposed gallium arsenide fab in china that was halted 
our consolidated orders backlog of million and deferred revenue of million resulted in a revenue backlog of million at september  shipments in fiscal were million including million from raider shipments 
net income was million  or  on net sales of million in fiscal compared with net income of million  or  on net sales of million in fiscal our gross margin increased to of net sales  up from in fiscal cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash and marketable securities were million at september   a decrease of million from million at september  results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales year ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development downsizing costs gain on sale of building total operating expenses income from operations other income expense income before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income fiscal compared with fiscal and fiscal net sales year ended september  dollars in millions net sales by product line semiconductor equipment license fees by geographical distribution  percentage of net tool sales north america europe asia  including japan net sales consist of revenues from sales of semiconductor equipment  spare parts and service and license fees 
our revenue recognition policy provides that revenue from sales of semiconductor equipment may be recognizable upon shipment if the tool incorporates proven technology existing tool and is shipped to a customer environment in which we have already successfully installed and gained acceptance of our products and the revenue recognition criteria in sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition have been met 
alternatively  revenue will be deferred and only recognized upon final customer acceptance for tools that are new technology products new tools or where an existing tool is sold into a new customer environment 
revenue for elements other than equipment  such as installation revenue  is included in tool acceptance revenue 
license fee revenue represents royalties generated from our anode technology 
our products are highly customized 
each customer has specific technical requirements for the performance of the equipment in the fabrication of semiconductor devices 
consequently  the specific terms of the acceptance provisions are negotiated with each customer on a tool specific basis in order to reflect the technical specifications that will be used to determine whether the tool passes the applicable acceptance tests 
these acceptance specifications are lengthy  technically complex and vary greatly from customer to customer and product to product 
we have a proven track recording of obtaining customer acceptances within a reasonable timeframe 
in the rare event when acceptance does not occur because the customer does not believe that the tool has met the applicable technical specifications  the parties treat the matter as a contractual issue that needs to be resolved before the customer accepts the equipment 
that resolution can take many different forms  including re testing the equipment  making technical modifications to resolve the disagreement or extending the warranty to accommodate a delayed acceptance 
whether or not a customer may have any further remedy where a resolution cannot be agreed between the parties  including any right of return of the equipment  would be a question of contract interpretation that ultimately would have to be adjudicated in accordance with applicable law 
net sales increased million  or approximately in fiscal as compared with fiscal levels 
despite the downturn in the semiconductor industry  our business activity levels increased in the second quarter of fiscal and those higher levels continued through the duration of the fiscal year with average quarterly revenues of approximately million per quarter in the last three quarters of the fiscal year 
revenues from raiders for wafer level packaging applications improved more than from fiscal levels as customers made capacity purchases and we penetrated key customers in asia and north america 
spending for ecd raiders for copper interconnect declined in fiscal from fiscal levels and revenue from our beol surface preparation raiders declined as customers for those applications cut back their capital spending 
sales of our single wafer surface preparation raiders for feol applications more than doubled as the industry continued to benefit from the move away from batch processing to single wafer processing to enable cleaning applications for sub nanometer structures 
the revenue contribution from spare parts  service and from our rhetech subsidiary continues to range from between to of our net sales 
we expect net sales to decline in the first quarter of fiscal due to the overall decline in the worldwide economy 
net sales declined or million to million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal business activity levels declined and we experienced a slow down in our bookings in the first three quarters of fiscal revenues for ecd raiders for copper interconnect applications increased by over as compared with fiscal levels while revenues from our wafer level packaging applications decreased by approximately 
revenues for our single wafer surface preparation raiders for feol applications increased approximately while revenues for beol cleans applications declined approximately from prior year levels 
feol tools benefited from the transition away from batch processing to single wafer processing to more closely control cleaning processes of smaller geometry devices whereas beol applications for current industry standard mm wafer fabs had previously made the transition to single wafer and were affected by the overall decline in semiconductor industry business levels 
overall  revenues from our raider platform contributed just more than to our fiscal revenues and while raider revenue declined in absolute dollars  the decline is the equivalent of two or three tools 
revenues from automated and manual batch tools  used primarily for cleaning applications declined by approximately million when compared with fiscal levels as single wafer processing continues to supplant batch processing in mm fabs 
the revenue contribution from spare parts  service and from our rhetech subsidiary was proportionate with fiscal levels 
geographically  our sales mix shifted toward asia in fiscal after being weighted toward north america and europe in fiscal asian tool sales increased percentage points in fiscal contributing to total tool sales in fiscal as we penetrated key customers in feol cleans and wafer level packaging markets 
european tool sales declined percentage points  contributing to total tool sales  as one of our key customers in europe cut back capital spending in fiscal north american tool sales declined percentage points in fiscal as compared with fiscal and contributed to total tool sales 
gross profit year ended september  dollars in thousands gross profit    percentage of net sales gross profit increased million in absolute dollars or in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross profit decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased in absolute dollars in fiscal because of higher sales volumes 
on a percentage basis  gross margin improved two percentage points 
tool margins declined slightly year over year but contributed approximately one percentage point to the margin increase because of higher sales volumes 
warranty and installation expense decreased in fiscal  contributing approximately one percentage point to the margin increase 
margins improved on wafer level packaging tools primarily due to a higher percentage of installation revenue than in fiscal but declined on beol raiders due to product mix and on copper interconnect tools 
geographically  margins improved in north america but declined slightly in asia  primarily due to product mix 
gross profit decreased in absolute dollars in fiscal because of lower sales volumes but improved by percentage points from fiscal margins improved a combined three percentage points on tool revenues  spare parts and service revenues and on sales from our rhetech subsidiary 
our tool margins improved on copper interconnect  feol and beol tools 
margin improvements were realized in both north america and asia 
installation revenues contributed more to overall revenue in both absolute dollars and on a percentage basis 
warranty and installation expense decreased in fiscal as compared with fiscal  contributing approximately one percentage point to the margin increase 
these margin improvements were partially offset by increased obsolescence and inventory reserve charges in the fourth quarter related to product enhancements on our raider tool line that rendered certain component parts obsolete 
selling  general and administrative year ended september  dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include employment costs for sales  marketing  customer support and administrative personnel as well as travel  communications  professional fees and expenses related to sales and service offices at our global locations 
sg a expenses increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and decreased million in fiscal as compared with fiscal employment costs and travel expense increased approximately million in fiscal as compared with fiscal in fiscal  we increased our service support staff in asia to better support our increasing asian customer base 
employment costs in certain of these regions are typically higher than in the united states 
travel expense related to supporting our asian customers also increased year over year 
commission expense increased approximately million in the annual comparison related to increased revenues in fiscal in april  in response to a slowdown in the semiconductor industry  we implemented a plan to align our cost structure with our business outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year 
the plan consisted primarily of a seven percent reduction in our worldwide work force  management pay cuts  mandatory leave and reduced overtime 
as a result  travel  aircraft and general business costs decreased over the course of the fiscal employment costs increased million over fiscal levels primarily related to expenses incurred prior to the implementation of the cost alignment plan in the second half of fiscal employment costs decreased million in the second half of fiscal commission expense declined million in fiscal related to our transition to a direct marketing and sales force in taiwan and china 
professional fees also declined in fiscal as compared with fiscal as fiscal professional fees included certain duplicate expenses related to the change in our external auditors 
research and development year ended september  dollars in thousands research and development    percentage of net sales research and development r d expense consists of salaries  project materials  laboratory costs  consulting fees and other costs associated with our product development efforts 
r d expense increased million in fiscal as compared with fiscal r d expense increased million in fiscal as compared with fiscal employment costs increased approximately in fiscal as compared with fiscal as we increased our staff to improve our wafer process engineering capabilities for our customers and due to merit increases  stock based compensation and recruiting costs 
depreciation expense increased by approximately  as we updated our demonstration laboratories with new technology tools to support our customers development efforts 
other expenses increased because of developmental work being completed at our austrian facility to develop cintillio  a batch tool designed for electroless plating applications 
we continued to work on a number of leading edge projects including on going development of porous silicon for the solar industry  feol cleaning applications  wafer edge cleaning processes  deep via and through silicon via applications and others 
increasing million  prototype expense was the primary driver in the million increase in r d expense in fiscal as compared with fiscal our surface preparation r d efforts were focused on feol cleaning applications  wafer edge cleaning processes and related equipment 
ecd r d focused on the development of a new processing chamber capable of plating copper for devices at the nanometer node and below  deep via applications  direct on barrier plating  thin seed layer enhancement processes  porous silicon processes and related equipment 
r d projects also included a single wafer copper annealing process 
travel expense increased in fiscal related to increased process support for our tools 
our research and development expense has fluctuated from period to period in the past 
we expect such fluctuations to continue in the future  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to the timing of expenditures and fluctuations in the level of net sales in a given period 
we expect to continue to fund r d expenditures with a multi year perspective and are committed to technology leadership in our sector of the semiconductor equipment industry 
downsizing costs year ended september  dollars in thousands downsizing costs percentage of net sales in april  we announced and implemented a plan to align our cost structure with then current business activity levels 
the cost reduction plan consisted primarily of a seven percent reduction in our worldwide work force  management pay cuts  mandatory leave and reduced overtime 
severance costs of  were reported as a separate component of operating expenses in our fiscal third quarter 
all costs related to the downsizing plan were fully incurred in the third quarter 
net of the downsizing costs  we saved approximately million in employment  travel and general business expenses in the second half of fiscal as compared with spending in the first half of fiscal in november  we took actions to align our cost structure with forecasted business activity levels 
the cost reduction measures consist primarily of layoffs  management pay cuts  reduced sales commissions and overtime and a company wide shutdown over the holidays 
severance costs will be reported as a separate component of operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal we are continuing to evaluate cost saving measures to further reduce our expenses 
gain on sale of building year ended september  dollars in thousands gain on sale of building percentage of net sales we sold a manufacturing facility located near kalispell  montana during the first quarter of fiscal for approximately million and recognized a gain on the sale of approximately  other income expense year ended september  in thousands interest income interest expense foreign exchange gain loss other total other income expense  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  based on an analysis that considered general economic conditions and company specific conditions  we determined that the one million shares acquired as an investment security in exchange for certain thermal assets in the first quarter of fiscal  had experienced an other than temporary impairment under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for investments in certain debt and equity securities sfas no 

accordingly  we revised our cost basis in the investment by writing off  to other expense 
this was partially offset by recycling income from our kalispell facilities and rental income from a portion of our cambridge facility 
interest income declined to  from  in fiscal and from  in fiscal because of lower investment levels 
interest expense decreased to  in fiscal because of lower bank interest rates and decreased use of our line of credit 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal because we used our line of credit more in fiscal than in fiscal we reported a foreign exchange loss of  in fiscal as compared to an exchange gain of  in fiscal and an exchange loss of  in fiscal related to foreign exchange gains and losses on unhedged intercompany sales with our japanese  korean  austrian and other subsidiaries 
beginning in april  due to a change in how we conduct business and following an evaluation of the scope of our operations and business practices  we concluded that the euro is the currency of the primary economic environment in which semitool austria operates and  consequently  changed the functional currency for semitool austria to the euro 
semitool austria invoices its customers in euros and its financing and operating activities are denominated in the euro 
accordingly  from april   all assets and liabilities of semitool austria are translated at period end exchange rates and all revenues and expenses are re measured at average rates prevailing during the period 
translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
income taxes year ended september  dollars in thousands income tax provision benefit    effective tax rate our estimated effective tax rate for fiscal is as compared to a benefit of as of september  our fiscal year tax rate is higher than in fiscal due to the expiration of the federal research and experimentation credit r e credit on december  and the additional benefits realized in fiscal year as described below 
the r e credit was extended on october  and accordingly no benefit was realized in fiscal year for the portion attributable to calendar year this portion of the r e credit will be realized in the first quarter of fiscal we estimate that the additional net discrete tax benefit will be between  and our estimated effective tax rate for fiscal was a benefit of as compared to the effective tax rate for fiscal of 
the fiscal year tax rate was lower than in fiscal based on a combination of the extension of the r e credit in fiscal for fiscal  the current year estimated r e credit and the decline in our net income before taxes from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the effective rate was also impacted by additional montana r d credits realized in excess of prior estimates and a tax benefit realized in the united kingdom for an exchange loss incurred translating statutory financial statements from the great britain pound to the us dollar 
our future effective tax rate is based on our continued investments in research and development programs qualifying for the credit and our expectations of earnings from operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates throughout the world 
effective october   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we increased our estimated net unrecognized tax benefits and accounted for the increase as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that resulted in a  decrease to our beginning retained earnings 
total unrecognized tax benefits at october   if recognized  would impact our tax rate 
we anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months but do not expect those changes to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during fiscal  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows year ended september  in thousands october  after adoption of fin  year to date net changes for unrecognized benefits and interest september   as of september   we are potentially subject to us federal income tax examinations for the fiscal tax years through and to non us income tax examinations for fiscal tax years through in addition  we are potentially subject to state income tax examinations for fiscal tax years through although they have not been assessed  under the guidance of fin  we include potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for taxes 
as of the date of adoption of fin  we had  of accrued potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits 
the accrued potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits decreased approximately  in the year ended september  backlog and deferred revenue year ended september  dollars in millions backlog percentage change in backlog year over year deferred revenue percentage change in deferred revenue year over year approximately of our backlog at september  was for raider tools 
deferred revenue decreased million at september  as compared with september  primarily because deferrals of raider shipments into new customer environments decreased 
shipments into new customer environments require full deferral of tool revenue until final customer acceptance in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
current deferrals include all or a part of raiders as compared with raiders at september  and raiders at september  we include in backlog those customer orders for which we have written customer authorization and for which shipment is scheduled within the next months 
orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by customers with limited or no cancellation fees 
as the result of systems ordered and shipped in the same quarter  possible changes in customer delivery dates  cancellations and shipment delays and acceptances of shipped equipment carried in deferred revenue  the backlog at any particular date and the bookings for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
in particular  during periods of downturns in the semiconductor industry we have experienced customer cancellations and requested delays in delivery 
deferred profit included in current liabilities is derived from deferred revenue  which primarily relates to equipment shipped to customers that has not been accepted by the customer  less the deferred cost of sales  including warranty and installation  and commission expenses 
deferred revenue is not included in orders backlog 
the components of deferred profit are as follows year ended september  dollars in thousands deferred revenue   deferred cost of sales manufacturing costs   deferred cost of sales warranty and installation costs  deferred sg a expense commissions deferred profit   stock based compensation effective the beginning of fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  and elected to adopt the modified prospective application method 
sfas no 
r requires us to use a fair value based method to account for stock based compensation 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period 
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model was developed for use in estimating the value of publicly traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options have characteristics that differ from those of publicly traded options 
total compensation cost recorded in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively  or million  million and  after tax  respectively  in each period  an impact of approximately  and per basic and diluted share 
through fiscal  we accounted for our stock option plans using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
cash used by operating activities was million in fiscal the primary uses of cash in fiscal were to support inventory growth of million and a million increase in trade receivables 
the inventory growth was primarily related to an increase in the number of demo tools placed with customers for evaluation 
the increase in trade receivables was primarily related to a million increase in shipments  the timing of those shipments and the timing of customer payments in fiscal in october and early november  we collected approximately million in trade receivables 
the primary sources of cash included net income of million  non cash operating activities  including depreciation and stock based compensation  of million and a million decrease in accounts payable as our inventory spending levels decreased in response to lower fourth quarter bookings 
operations provided million in cash during fiscal the primary use of cash in fiscal was a million decrease in accounts payable as our payables declined due to lower business activity levels compared to fiscal as a result of the inventory reduction plan implemented in the third quarter as well as a write off of obsolete inventory in the fourth quarter  inventories declined by million 
customer advances decreased million as we shipped the tools underlying those advances 
income taxes payable and payroll related liabilities decreased million 
the primary sources of cash from operations during fiscal were net income of million and non cash components of net income including million in depreciation and amortization expense offset by a million decrease in deferred income taxes 
investing activities 
fiscal investing activities included million in purchases of factory and laboratory equipment and the acquisition of land adjacent to our salzburg  austria facility 
additionally  we invested million in our development and demonstration laboratories by transferring finished goods inventory to property  plant and equipment 
we also invested approximately  in our patent portfolio 
investing activities in fiscal included million in purchases of factory and laboratory equipment  other property and the expansion and remodeling of our rhetech subsidiary facility 
additionally we invested million in our development and demonstration laboratories by transferring finished goods inventory to property  plant and equipment 
these investments in our equipment and facilities were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment  primarily a manufacturing facility located near kalispell  montana  which we sold for approximately million 
we also invested a net amount of million in our patent portfolio 
financing activities 
financing activities in fiscal provided million in cash and consisted primarily of million in borrowings under long term debt to purchase land adjacent to our salzburg  austria facility and a net million draw on our revolving line of credit 
stock option exercises provided million in fiscal offsetting these sources of cash  we repaid million on our long term debt 
financing activities in fiscal provided cash of million and consisted primarily of million in borrowings under long term debt for our rhetech subsidiary expansion and remodeling project and million in new long term debt used to finance the acquisition  remodeling and equipping of a manufacturing facility located near kalispell  montana 
the million financing with first interstate bank is under a value added loan program sponsored by the montana board of investments mboi 
the mboi participation in of the loan carries an interest rate of for the first five years and for the second five years of a ten year term 
the of the loan financed by first interstate bank has a interest rate over the ten year term 
stock option exercises also provided million in fiscal offsetting these sources of cash  we repaid short term borrowings of million on our revolving line of credit in fiscal there were no advances outstanding on the revolving credit line as of september off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to the types of financing  liquidity  market or credit risks that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
the following commitments as of september   incurred in the normal course of business  have been included in the consolidated financial statements with the exception of purchase order commitments and operating lease obligations  which are properly excluded under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
they are disclosed in the following table in order to provide a consolidated picture of our financial position and liquidity 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt      operating leases   purchase order commitments   total commitments      we have agreements with limited liability companies wholly owned by mr 
raymon f 
thompson  our chairman and chief executive officer  to lease aircraft and an aircraft hangar 
under these agreements  rent expense was approximately  for the year ended september    for the year ended september  and  for the year ended september  the current rental rate is approximately  per month for both the aircraft and the hangar  the lease terms are month to month and therefore are not included in the above table 
the terms of the lease agreements were based on comparable information on lease rates received from independent aircraft leasing dealers and finance entities for similar aircraft 
we believe that these lease agreements are on terms no less favorable to us than could have been obtained from an unaffiliated party 
as of september   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our million revolving line of credit 
the credit facility is with wells fargo and bears interest at the bank s prime lending rate  as of september   or at our option  libor plus  or as of that date 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we amended the credit agreement with wells fargo  extending the expiration date of the credit facility and redefining two of the financial covenants 
the revolving credit line now expires on march  the credit agreement has various restrictive covenants including a prohibition against pledging real  fixed or intangible assets during the term of the agreement and the maintenance of various financial covenants 
if we were to default on the credit agreement or if there were a materially adverse change in our financial condition  the bank could accelerate payment of any advances outstanding under the credit agreement 
in addition  the availability of funds requires compliance with certain financial covenants  including a maximum borrowing limit based on a funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio which replaces a profitability covenant  and a maximum borrowing limit based on trade receivables 
we currently are in compliance with our debt covenants  however  there is no assurance that in the future we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants so as to ensure availability of the line 
we believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents  along with funds expected to be generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility to meet operating expenses and planned capital expenditures through fiscal and into the foreseeable future 
we estimate capital expenditures will be between million and million during the next twelve months 
if additional financial resources are required in the future  we may need to issue additional common stock or other financial instruments whichever management deems advisable 
there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to issue additional common stock or other financial instruments on acceptable terms 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  warranty obligations  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  employee benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition is significant because revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we recognize revenue under the guidance for staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
under this method  revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
our product sales generally contain substantive customer acceptance provisions 
sales of new products to new or existing customers are not recognized until customer acceptance 
likewise  sales of existing products to new customer environments are not recognized until customer acceptance 
if multiple elements exist  sales of existing products into existing customer environments are treated as such in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amount of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements is the lesser of the fair value of the equipment or the contracted amount that was due or payable upon title transfer 
the revenue for elements other than equipment is recorded in deferred profit and is recognized when the remaining goods and or services are delivered or performed 
revenue related to service is recognized upon completion of performance of the service or ratably over the life of the related service contract 
spare parts sales are recognized upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
unearned revenue from service contract agreements is included in customer advances in the current liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  the timing of certain expenses  such as cost of sales  including installation and warranty  and commission expenses coincides with the recognition of the related revenues 
we follow specific guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments such as the definition of a new customer environment and new acceptance criteria or if installation is perfunctory may be required in the application of our revenue recognition policy 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
accordingly  we write down the carrying value of inventories for estimated obsolescence and future marketability 
on a quarterly basis  we compare historical and projected sales and usage of raw materials and parts and our assumptions about future use of raw materials  parts and finished goods with our forecast  market demand and industry conditions to determine potential obsolescence or whether the inventory on hand represents excess quantities 
as a result of our analysis  we record reserves impacting cost of sales  if appropriate 
these reserves are subject to management judgment and if actual future use  demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory valuation write downs may be required 
warranty obligations 
we provide for the estimated cost of equipment warranties when the related revenue is recognized 
we track individual warranties on a tool by tool basis and develop estimated rates by equipment class based on this history 
the rates are used to estimate the warranty accrual for a given specific piece of equipment 
these rates are revised periodically to reflect current cost trends due to the current life cycle of that product class 
the warranty accrual is reduced by actual costs of providing the warranty or if a balance is remaining at the end of the warranty period  then that amount is also written off 
warranty accrual expense impacts primarily cost of sales 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record expense as a component of selling  general and administrative within the consolidated statements of income 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  due to the cyclicality of the industries we serve or for other reasons  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and expense may be required 
likewise  if we are successfully able to collect on an amount presumed to be uncollectible  the allowance for doubtful accounts and the related expense may be reduced 
in general  it takes longer to collect payment in the capital equipment industry than in certain other industries 
days sales outstanding dso of peer companies in our industry ranges between approximately and days 
deferred tax assets 
we make estimates to determine the amount of our deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  however  should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  a decrease in the deferred tax asset would negatively impact our results of operations  particularly the income tax provision  in the period such determination was made 
stock based compensation 
in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method and began accounting for stock based compensation using a fair value based recognition method 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time 
a small change in the estimates used can have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock options  consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r and sab no 
 including stock based compensation determined under a fair value method as prescribed by sfas no 

we estimate stock price volatility based on a blended rate of historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock
