bank of the carolinas corporation the company is a north carolina chartered bank holding company that was incorporated on may   for the sole purpose of serving as the parent bank holding company for the bank 
the bank is an insured  north carolina chartered bank that began operations on december   under the name bank of davie 
because the company has no operations and conducts no business on its own other than owning bank of carolinas the bank  the discussion contained in these footnotes concerns primarily the business of the bank 
however  for ease of reading and because the financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis  the company and its subsidiary are collectively referred to herein as the company unless otherwise noted 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the notes to our audited financial statements for the years ended december   and contain a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe our policies with respect to methodology for the determination of our allowance for loan losses  and our asset impairment judgments  such as the recoverability of the intangible assets  involve a higher degree of complexity and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
accordingly  we consider the policies related to those areas critical 
our allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimatable  and ii sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  the present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market  and the loan balance 
the allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to income 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which those loans  in our opinion  become uncollectible 
recoveries during the period are credited to the allowance 
the factors that influence our judgment in determining the amount charged to non interest expense include past loan experience  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s determination of the allowance is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses 
this model has several components 
the first component involves the estimation of losses on loans management has individually evaluated and defined as impaired loans 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the estimated valuation allowance is the difference  if any  between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined by either an estimate of the cash flows that we expect to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan s effective rate  or in the case of a collateral dependent loan  the fair value of the collateral 
second  for all other loans  including individually evaluated loans determined not to be impaired  the bank establishes an allowance for groups or pools of loans with similar risk characteristics by applying the average actual historical loss rates for these pools 
finally  there is a component to adjust for several qualitative or environmental factors that could cause estimated credit losses within the bank s existing portfolio to differ from the historical loss experience 
we review our allowance on a quarterly basis and believe that the allowance is appropriate to cover inherent loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date 
however  the determination of the allowance using our procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans 
no assurance can be given that we will not  in any particular period  sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amounts reserved for those loans  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio and our allowance  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their routine examination process  periodically review our allowance 
those agencies may require that we make additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
accounting for intangible assets is as prescribed by sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we account for recognized intangible assets based on their estimated useful lives 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized  while intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
currently  our recognized intangible asset consists of goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to fair value impairment tests on at least an annual basis 
if based upon our evaluation impairment has occurred  the impairment charge is recognized at that time 
based on the evaluation and testing described above  we have determined that our recorded goodwill is not impaired 
overview during the year  our assets increased by million to million at december  from million at year end our net income for was million as compared to million for the amount included a one time after tax charge of  related to the terminated merger agreement with randolph bank trust company 
the amount included a million after tax gain from the sale of our carthage branch to first bank 
excluding these one time items  net income for would have decreased by  compared to during  we entered into an agreement to acquire randolph bank and trust company 
the merger agreement was terminated during november of after randolph s shareholders failed to garner the approval rate needed to consummate the merger 
the bank did experience significant growth of over million in its loan portfolio during however even with this growth the bank  along with most other community banks  has struggled to maintain its net interest margins in this current interest rate environment and will most likely continue to face those same challenges in we continued to expand our franchise by opening a new branch in early in winston salem 
the bank also opened a branch in the concord area in july 
each of these branches marked our first forays into these cities 
we strive to serve the financial needs of small to medium sized businesses  individuals  and residential homebuilders  offering a broad array of banking and other financial products emphasizing superior customer service 
real estate secured loans  including construction loans and loans secured by existing commercial and residential properties  comprise the majority of our loan portfolio  with the balance of our loans consisting of commercial and industrial loans and loans to individuals 
we also offer certain loan products through associations with various mortgage lending companies 
through these associations  we originate family residential mortgages  at both fixed and variable rates 
we earn fees for originating these loans and transferring the loan package to the mortgage lending companies 
it has been our strategy to recruit skilled banking professionals who are well trained and highly knowledgeable about our market area  enabling us to develop and maintain a loan portfolio of sound credit quality 
the deposit services we offer include small business and personal checking accounts  savings accounts  money market checking accounts and certificates of deposit 
the bank concentrates on providing customer service to build its customer deposit base and competes aggressively in the area of transaction accounts 
additional funding includes borrowings from the federal home loan bank and from federal funds purchased lines of credit 
our results of operations are heavily dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also materially affected by our provision for loan losses  fee income generated from deposit and loan accounts  and noninterest expenses 
our noninterest expense primarily consists of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy expense  professional services  advertising  and other noninterest expenses 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  changes in interest rates  and actions of regulatory and governmental authorities 
financial condition at december  and december  total assets at december   increased by million or to million compared to million at december  we had earning assets of million at december  consisting of million in gross loans  million in investment securities and million in overnight investments 
stockholders equity was million at december  compared to million at december  loans 
gross loans grew by million or during the twelve months of  from million on december  to million at december  on december   real estate loans were  and commercial loans were of the total loan portfolio 
gross loans represented and of our total assets on december   and  respectively 
interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk  maturity and amount of the loan 
competitive pressures  money market rates  availability of funds  and government regulation also influence interest rates 
on average  our loan portfolio yielded for the year ending december  as compared to an average yield of during we intend to continue the growth of high quality loan assets to the extent permitted by our capital 
with continued expansion of our geographic market area and the strong acceptance of our products and services within the communities we serve  we expect loan growth to continue at its current rate

we are required to maintain an allowance for loan losses that reflects the size and risk in our loan portfolio 
this has made it necessary for us to make significant provisions for loan losses  which principally reflect the growth of the loan portfolio 
we expect our loan growth to continue at its current rate and that our provisions for loan losses will continue to be a major portion of our non interest expense 
during  we recorded gross charge offs in the amount of  which impacted our provision for loan losses during the period 
growth of our loan portfolio as well as an overall increase in non performing assets were the most significant factors contributing to the increase in our allowance for loan losses

asset quality 
certain credit risks are inherent in making loans  particularly commercial and consumer loans 
we assess these risks and attempt to manage them effectively 
we also attempt to reduce credit risk by adhering to internal credit underwriting policies and procedures 
these policies and procedures include officer and customer limits  periodic loan documentation review and follow up on exceptions to credit policies 
a loan is placed in a non accrual status when  in our judgment  the collection of interest appears doubtful 
nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans contractually past due for more than days but still accruing interest  and foreclosed or idled properties 
on december   we had loans with an aggregate principal balance of million that were delinquent over days  and  that were in non accrual status 
interest accrued  but not recognized as income on non accrual loans  was approximately  during on the same date  we had total nonperforming assets of million  which includes other real estate owned 
a large portion of our loans delinquent over days were made to one customer 
the loans outstanding to this customer included in the days past due total were million 
of that amount  million is backed by a usda guarantee  thereby substantially decreasing our potential write off should the customer default 
we also have an additional  in non accruing loans related to this same customer 
we continue to work with this customer to bring their account current 
other real estate owned at december   totaled million and consisted of nine properties 
other real estate owned is carried on the balance sheet at values that we feel are less than or equal to the net amounts we will receive for the properties when they are sold

we use our investment portfolio as a tool to provide liquidity  manage interest rate risk and provide supplemental earnings 
with our rapid growth since we began operations  and with the continuing growth we expect will occur  we recognize the need to manage liquidity through our investment portfolio 
our securities may be sold from time to time to increase liquidity or re balance the interest rate sensitivity profile of our balance sheet

retail deposits gathered through our branch network continue to be our principal source of funding 
it is our intent to focus our efforts and marketing resources on the growth of our deposit base as we believe this to be the most cost effective strategy for profitable growth

the majority of the fluctuation in these amounts is a reflection of the one time items previously mentioned 
return on average assets was  and and return on average equity was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net interest income 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is the difference between income generated by our interest earning assets primarily loans  investment securities  and interest bearing balances and the expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits and borrowed funds used to fund earning assets 
net interest income was virtually unchanged from to at million and million respectively  while net interest income amounted to million in our net interest margin and net interest spread decreased to and in from and in and and in these decreases have primarily been a function of a flat to inverted yield curve in conjunction with nearly equal growth between interest earning asset and liabilities 
during  average interest earning assets grew million during the year while average interest bearing liabilities grew by million 
this nearly identical growth in assets and liabilities coupled with an increase of basis points on the assets versus basis points for the liabilities led to the decrease in the margins 
our net interest income is affected by both the difference between the rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

provision for loan losses increased  to  during from million for this was only a slight increase over the amount 
the increased provision was primarily due to increased loan volume as well as an increase in non performing assets and charge offs during the year 
the bank s non performing assets increased  over the amount 
however  outstanding credits to one customer total million  and million of that amount is backed by a usda guarantee should the customer default

nonperforming loans as a percentage of net loans increased to at december  from at december  and 
at december  provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level we deem appropriate 
in evaluating the allowance for loan losses  we consider factors that include growth  composition and industry diversification of the portfolio  historical loan loss experience  current delinquency levels  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors 
non interest income 
in addition to net interest income  we derive revenues from a variety of financial products and services offered to our customers 
the majority of our non interest income results from service charges on our deposit accounts  including charges for insufficient funds  check sales  and fees charged for non deposit services and from mortgage loan broker fees 
also in  we started an investment sales division which generated  of non interest income for the bank in non interest income increased by  or for the year ended december   exclusive of a million dollar gain on the sale of our carthage branch during the increase for the year ended december  as compared to was  also exclusive of the gain

the fdic has issued risk based capital and leverage capital guidelines for measuring the adequacy of a bank s capital  and all applicable capital standards must be satisfied for us to be considered in compliance with the fdic s requirements 
on december   our total capital ratio and tier capital ratio were and  respectively  which were well above the minimum levels required by the fdic s guidelines 
on december   our leverage capital ratio was  which was also well above the minimum level required by the fdic s guidelines 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity 
maintaining adequate liquidity  while managing interest rate risk  is the primary goal of our asset and liability management strategy 
liquidity is the ability to fund the needs of our borrowers and depositors  pay operating expenses and meet regulatory requirements 
maturing investments  loan repayments  deposit growth and borrowing from the federal home loan bank are presently the main sources of the bank s liquidity 
the bank s primary uses of liquidity are to fund loans  operating expenses  deposit withdrawals  repay borrowings and to make investments 
interest rate sensitivity 
our goal is to maintain a neutral position on interest rate sensitivity whereby little or no change in interest income would occur as interest rates change 
on december   we were cumulatively asset sensitive for the next twelve months  which means that our interest bearing assets would reprice more quickly than our interest bearing liabilities 
theoretically  our net interest margin will increase if market interest rates rise or decrease if market interest rates fall 
however  the repricing characteristic of assets is different from the repricing characteristics of funding sources 
therefore  net interest income can be impacted by changes in interest rates even if the repricing opportunities of assets and liabilities are perfectly matched 
the following table shows the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet on december   but is not necessarily indicative of our position on other dates 
each category of assets and liabilities is shown with projected repricing and maturity dates 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets or liabilities 
loans with adjustable rates are shown as being due at the end of the next upcoming adjustment period 
now accounts  savings accounts  and money market accounts are assumed to be subject to immediate repricing and depositor availability 
prepayment assumptions on mortgage loans and decay rates on deposit accounts have not been included in this analysis 
also  the table does not reflect scheduled principal repayments that will be received on loans 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities may vary substantially if different assumptions are used or if our actual experience differs from that indicated by the assumptions

as a result  a bank s performance may be significantly influenced by changes in interest rates 
although the banking industry is more affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation in the price of goods and services  inflation also is a factor that may influence interest rates 
yet  the frequency and magnitude of interest rate fluctuations do not necessarily coincide with changes in the general inflation rate 
inflation does affect our operating expense in that personnel expense and the cost of supplies and outside services tend to increase more during periods of high inflation
