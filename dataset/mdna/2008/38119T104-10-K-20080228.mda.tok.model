non gaap financial measures in this form k  we use the terms total operating cost per ounce  total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce 
total operating cost per ounce is equal to mine operating costs for the period  as found on our consolidated statements of operations  divided by the ounces of gold sold in the period 
mine operating costs include all mine site operating costs  including the costs of mining  processing  maintenance  work in process inventory changes  mine site overhead  production taxes and royalties  mine site depreciation  depletion  amortization  asset retirement obligations and by product credits but does not include exploration costs  corporate general and administrative expenses  impairment charges  corporate business development costs  gains and losses on asset sales  interest expense  gains and losses on derivatives  foreign currency gains and losses  gains and losses on investments and income tax 
total cash cost per ounce for a period is equal to mining operations costs for the period  as found on our consolidated statements of operations  divided by the number of ounces of gold sold during the period 
cash operating cost per ounce for a period is equal to total cash costs for the period less production royalties and production taxes  divided by the number of ounces of gold sold during the period 
the calculations of total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce are in compliance with an industry standard for such measures established in by the gold institute  a non profit industry group 
the following table shows the derivation of these measures and a reconciliation of total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce

since  our exploration efforts have been focused on ghana  other west african countries and south america 
in line with our business strategy  we acquired bogoso in and have operated a carbon in leach processing plant since that time to process oxide and other non refractory ores bogoso oxide processing plant 
in  we acquired prestea and mined surface deposits at prestea from late to late in late  we acquired wassa  and following completion of a feasibility study  constructed a new oxide processing plant at wassa which began commercial operation in april in we completed construction and development of a new nominal million tonnes per annum processing facility at bogoso prestea that uses bio oxidation technology to treat refractory sulfide ore bogoso sulfide processing plant 
this facility was placed in commercial service on july  in late  we acquired the hbb properties 
in april  we completed a feasibility study for the development and mining of the hbb properties and development activities are now underway 
we expect to begin mining at the benso property in the third quarter of  with the ore being transported to wassa for processing 
our overall objective since has been to grow our business to become a mid tier gold producer with an annualized production rate in excess of  ounces 
with completion of the new sulfide processing plant at bogoso and development of the hbb properties in  we expect to reach this goal in we continue to evaluate potential acquisition and merger opportunities that could further increase our annual gold production 
however  we presently have no agreement or understanding with respect to any specific potential transaction 

table of contents in addition to our gold mining and development activities  we are actively exploring for gold in west africa and south america  investing approximately million on such activities during and million in we are actively conducting regional reconnaissance projects in ghana  cote d ivoire and sierra leone and have drilled more advanced targets in ghana  niger and burkina faso 
we are also evaluating a property in french guiana and participating in a joint venture in suriname 
significant trends and events during bogoso sulfide expansion project the new bogoso sulfide processing plant operated throughout the second half of  but gold output was lower than expected 
while sulfide flotation recovery rates improved during the period  recovery is still below design rates and plant throughput has been limited at certain periods by agitator shaft failures 
efforts are now underway to rectify the recovery and throughput problems 
our remediation plans include an expanded oxygen plant in the cil circuit  a new re grind mill to process coarse sulfide particles  installation of stronger agitator shafts in the bio oxidation reactor tanks and further engineering analysis of various operating parameters that should result in increased operational efficiencies 
in general  most other plant components are now operating satisfactorily 
crushing  grinding  conditioning  bio oxidation  neutralization and elution have now demonstrated design capability 
the bio oxidation circuit is achieving expected sulfide oxidation and is frequently processing ore tonnages in excess of its designed rate 
bogoso oxide plant operation due to a shortage of oxide ore  the bogoso oxide processing plant activated its sulfide flotation circuit in the fourth quarter of and has effectively become a second sulfide processing plant at bogoso 
it is operating effectively in this mode and is furnishing approximately tonnes per day of sulfide concentrate to the new bogoso sulfide processing plant s bio oxidation circuit where it is mixed with the sulfide concentrate from the sulfide processing plant 
power restrictions in ghana low water levels in the akosombo reservoir in central ghana during and much of caused a significant drop in power output at the volta river authority s vra akosombo hydroelectric generating plant which is ghana s major source of electric power 
this  in turn  resulted in power rationing in ghana during certain periods of and above normal rainfall in late has raised water levels at the akosombo reservoir to near normal levels and the vra announced on october  that it had suspended all power rationing in ghana 
we have since ceased generating power from our own generators and are currently relying on the ghana national grid for all our power needs 
in response to the recent power rationing  we  along with three other gold mining companies operating in ghana  organized a consortium which purchased and constructed a nominal megawatt power station in ghana 
construction was completed prior to the end of and the plant has since generated power on a regular basis adding  its output to the ghana national grid 
our share of the acquisition and construction costs totaled during  the four owners expect to transfer ownership and operational responsibility of the plant to the ghana power authority 
see subsequent events below for the impact of a fire at the plant in early in future periods of rationing  if any  the four consortium companies will have the right to take megawatts from the national grid in excess of limits set by any future vra rationing programs 
our share is expected to be approximately megawatts  which will be sufficient to provide up to of our total ghana power requirements 
separately  in august we entered into a take or pay agreement to purchase a minimum of megawatts of power from a power provider who will construct operate and maintain a megawatt power station at the bogoso plant site as discussed in more detail below 
it is expected that construction will begin on this power station in first quarter of with completion scheduled for mid the plant can be fueled with diesel  residual fuel oil or heavy fuel oil 
while there is currently no power rationing in ghana  if rationing was to re occur in the future  we expect that power from the new consortium plant  from our on site diesel generators at wassa  from the new plant to be constructed at bogoso and our rationed share of the national grid power would be adequate to meet our total future power requirements 

table of contents gold prices gold prices have generally trended upward during the last five years  from a low of just under per ounce in early to a high of over per ounce in early much of the price increase during this period appears to be related to the fall in the value of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies 
we realized an average gold price of per ounce for our shipments during  up from per ounce in pampe and prestea south while the pampe pit delivered approximately  tonnes of oxide ore to the bogoso oxide processing plant following initiation of mining in february  during the fourth quarter mining was scaled back to accommodate a pit high wall pushback 
the pampe pit will continue to ship limited amounts of oxide ore to an oxide stockpile at bogoso during during we expect to obtain permits for several oxide open pits  collectively known as the prestea south project  on the southern portion of the prestea property 
an environmental impact statement eis has been submitted to the epa and public consultations have been completed 
subject to the receipt of comments on the eis from the epa  ongoing public consultation and the timely receipt of all permits  we expect to commence development of prestea south in late with mining to commence in the prestea south oxide ore will be transported to bogoso  blended with pampe oxide ore and processed through the bogoso oxide processing plant 
the prestea south sulfide ore will be processed through the bogoso sulfide processing plant 
equity offering on march   we sold million common shares at a price of per share resulting in million in gross proceeds 
net proceeds were million after deducting underwriting commissions but before deducting offering expenses 
on march   the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional million common shares for additional gross proceeds of million 
after deducting the underwriter s commission  net proceeds from the additional shares were million 
proceeds were used to complete the purchase and installation of a interest in an electric power station in ghana  for completion and start up of the bogoso sulfide expansion project  for development of the hbb properties  and for general corporate and working capital purposes 
warrants on february   million share purchase warrants expired unexercised 
these warrants were originally issued in in conjunction with an equity offering at a strike price of cdn 
management changes peter bradford  president and chief executive officer of golden star  resigned from his position as an officer effective december  and from his board position at the end of january on january  mr 
thomas mair  our senior vice president and chief financial officer assumed the position of interim president and chief executive officer and mr 
roger palmer  our vice president finance and controller  assumed the position of interim chief financial officer 
mr 
nigel tamlyn assumed responsibility as general manager at bogoso prestea in december mr 
mitch wasel  formerly our exploration manager africa  was promoted to serve as vice president of exploration  effective september  replacing mr 
douglas jones who resigned as vice president of exploration on august  paul isnard in december we reached agreement with euro ressources  sa euro to acquire rights to euro s paul isnard property in french guiana 
the december agreement was amended in march the agreement  as amended  required us to  among other things  prepare a feasibility study on the paul isnard property and spend at least million  inclusive of expenditures made previously  on the property by november  as required by the french government authorities which granted the paul isnard prospecting permit to euro 
the feasibility study is now underway and we plan to spend approximately million at paul isnard over the next months on geophysics  geology  drilling and engineering studies to fulfill our commitment to complete the feasibility study 
in addition  we have agreed to pay a royalty to euro on all future gold production  if any  from the paul isnard property up to million ounces 
the royalty varies from ten percent of the difference between the market price of gold per ounce and  for all gold sales up to million ounces and five percent of the same for gold sales between million and million ounces 
furthermore  we have agreed  subject to completion of a positive feasibility study  to pay an annual million advance 
table of contents royalty to euro beginning september and continuing until such time as the paul isnard property begins mining and selling gold 
the total advanced royalty payments will be deducted from royalties payable during the production period on the first million ounces 
bogoso power plant in august we entered into an agreement with genser power ghana ltd genser under which genser will construct  operate and maintain a megawatt rated power plant at our bogoso plant site 
we have agreed to purchase electric power from genser s plant per the following formula in months where our average monthly demand is equal to or less than megawatts  we will pay genser  per month plus the cost of fuel regardless of the amount of power used 
in months where our average monthly demand exceeds megawatts  we will pay genser kilowatt hour for amounts in excess of megawatts plus fuel costs 
we are currently arranging a letter of credit for the new plant 
the initial amount of indemnification will be million and will increase each month after initiation of construction reaching a maximum of approximately million in the seventh month 
the letter of credit will decrease progressively over the subsequent months until it reaches nil at the end of the months following the start of construction 
at any point in the first months we can terminate the contract by making a payment to genser equal to the remaining balance on the letter of credit 
if such payment is made  genser will release the letter of credit and the title to the power plant will be transferred to us 
if the contract is terminated after months  title to the plant will transfer to us for no consideration 
we expect construction to begin in the first quarter of following completion of a letter of credit  with completion scheduled for mid goulagou rounga in mid october we entered into an option agreement with riverstone resources inc riverstone whereby riverstone will have the right to acquire our interest in our goulagou and rounga properties in burkina faso 
to exercise the option  riverstone is required to spend cdn million on exploration programs on the goulagou and rounga properties over four years from the date of the option agreement  and may then purchase our interest for million in cash or riverstone common shares 
in addition  we will receive up to two million shares of riverstone over the term of the option and have already received two million common share purchase warrants of riverstone having exercise prices that range from cdn to cdn depending on the date of the exercise 
we will also retain a production related net smelter return royalty of up to 
the goulagou and rounga properties were acquired through our december acquisition of st 
jude resources ltd 
convertible debentures on november  we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior unsecured debentures due november  the net proceeds of the offering were million 
we used million of the proceeds to repay our existing million aggregate principal amount senior convertible notes due april  we intend to use the balance for property development and general corporate purposes 
sale of residual royalty and receipt of loan payment in december  we completed two transactions with euro 
the first transaction was the sale of the rosebel additional participation right to euro for million 
the rosebel additional participation right was in effect a royalty on future production from iamgold s rosebel mine 
the royalty is payable at per ounce for rosebel production between two and four million ounces and at per ounce for production between four and seven million ounces 
in addition euro paid million to us as final payment of debt and interest owed for euro s purchase of our rosebel royalty in december these transactions contributed approximately million of cash flow and million pre tax earnings in the fourth quarter 
golden star continues to hold approximately million shares of euro which equates to an interest of approximately of euro s outstanding shares 

table of contents subsequent events ghana stock exchange listing and share offering in february  our common shares were listed on the ghana stock exchange in accra  ghana to support the further growth of the ghana stock exchange and to allow our employees and stakeholders in ghana an opportunity to invest in golden star 
in conjunction with the listing we issued  golden star common shares to investors in ghana and europe at a price of cedis 
all shares issued are tradable on the toronto stock exchange and the american stock exchange as well as on the ghana stock exchange 
fire damage at consortium power plant in february  fire damaged the new nominal megawatt power plant that we  along with three other mining companies operating in ghana  constructed during while damage assessment is not yet complete  it is expected that the plant will be shut down for at least a few months 
the plant was fully insured and our of the deductible is de minimis 
loss of the plant s power output will not impact our operations nor the over all ghana power grid availability unless there is a return to power rationing in ghana as there was in and early based on ghana s current power situation  we do not expect that rationing would reoccur during the repair period at the new power plant 
results of operations compared to consolidated results our consolidated net loss totaled million or per share for  as compared to net income of million or per share in the major factor contributing to the better results in was the sale of non core assets  including all of our moto goldmines limited shares and most of our euro shares 
a million pre tax gain was recognized in on the sale the moto shares and a million pre tax gain was recorded for the sale of million euro shares 
in comparison  during  sales of assets added only million to pre tax income 
summary of financial results gold sales oz average realized price oz revenues in thousands cash flow provided by operations in thousands net income loss in thousands net income loss per share basic mine operating margin losses totaled million in  down from a million positive operating margin in overall bogoso prestea s ounces sold and average gold prices increased over levels  but bogoso operating margins were adversely affected in the second half of the year when the new bogoso sulfide processing plant was placed in service 
the new plant s operating costs were recognized in the second half following its july in service date  but gold recovery difficulties resulted in lower than expected revenues which resulted in a negative operating margin 
increases in the costs of labor  reagents  fuel  power and depreciation in also contributed to the lower margin versus general and administrative costs increased by million to million in the increase is primarily attributable to additions to the management team in  legal fees on financing activities and stock based compensation expenses 
derivative losses decreased by to million in most of the derivative losses incurred during were related to gold hedges held by our former subsidiary  euro 
a million loss on debt restructuring was incurred in november upon the redemption of convertible notes with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the majority of the foreign exchange gains earned in are related to canadian dollar accounts that held the proceeds of a december equity offering 
much of the interest expense was capitalized into the bogoso sulfide processing plant construction costs 
following the end of construction in mid  interest expense was once again recognized in the period incurred 
bogoso prestea operations compared to bogoso prestea recorded an operating margin loss of million versus a positive operating margin of million in the bogoso prestea oxide processing plant s operations were adversely impacted by lower ore grades and insufficient oxide ore versus delays in obtaining permits for pampe resulted in processing of lower grade oxide ores from various small deposits in the bogoso area 
a day maintenance shut down in may also contributed to the lower gold output 
start up of the new bogoso sulfide processing plant was delayed until july  by plant equipment failures and design problems 
similar problems after start up contributed to plant throughput and gold recovery below design levels 
both plants were also adversely affected by country wide power shortages during the year and by increases in several categories of operating costs 

table of contents the total combined cash operating costs of the oxide and the sulfide operations totaled million in  as compared to million in the major factor contributing to the cost increase was recognition of the new sulfide operation costs after its july  in service date 
increases in labor  consumables and power costs at the oxide processing plant also contributed to the increase over the amounts 
cost increases included fuel costs which were up per liter from a year earlier 
the cost of cyanide increased per tonne and steel grinding balls were per tonne higher than a year earlier 
the higher operating costs and lower than expected production at the new sulfide operation  and lower ore grades and lower throughput at the bogoso oxide processing plant  combined to yield an average cash operating cost at bogoso prestea of per ounce  up from per ounce beginning in the fourth quarter of  in response to a shortfall of oxide ore from the new pampe pit  the bogoso oxide processing plant activated its flotation circuit and began processing sulfide ore with the sulfide flotation concentrate going to the new sulfide processing plant s bio oxidation circuit for further processing 
the switch to the harder sulfide ore reduced throughput 
the new bio oxidation circuit has sufficient excess capacity to accommodate all of the bogoso oxide processing plant s sulfide concentrate

the bogoso oxide processing plant processed an average of  tonnes per day during this included  tonnes of oxide ores from january to october and  tonnes of sulfide ores from november to december  this compares to an average of  tonnes per day in the new bogoso sulfide processing plant operated throughout the second half of  but plant throughput and gold output were below design rates 
sulfide flotation recovery rates improved throughout the period but recovery was still below design rates 
the new sulfide plant processed an average of  tonnes of ore per day during the fourth quarter 
efforts are now underway to rectify the recovery problems including expansion of the oxygen plant in the cil circuit  a new re grind mill to process coarse sulfide particles  installation of stronger agitator shafts in the bio oxidation reactor tanks to improve availability and further engineering analysis of various operating parameters that should result in increased operational efficiencies 
in general  most other plant components are now operating satisfactorily 
crushing  grinding  conditioning  bio oxidation  neutralization and elution have now demonstrated design capability 
the bio oxidation circuit is achieving the expected sulfide oxidation levels and is processing ore tonnages in excess of its designed rate 
wassa operations compared to wassa generated a million positive operating margin in versus a million operating margin loss in two factors contributed to the performance improvement in addition to higher gold prices 
first  was a significant decrease in waste mining tonnage which resulted in lower overall mining costs 
secondly  the average ore grade increased from grams per tonnes in to grams per tonne in reduced waste mining requirements in freed up mining equipment to mine increased amounts 
table of contents of pit ore which resulted in the need for less of the low grade heap leach ore was required 
wassa also mined more tonnes from the new higher grade pits than in these improvements resulted in gold sales of  ounces in  up from  ounces in wassa s cash operating costs totaled million in  up from million in the increase was largely due to increases in the costs of labor  consumables and power 
cost increases versus a year earlier include fuel which was up per liter  cyanide which increased by percent per tonne and steel grinding balls which increased by per tonne 
power shortages during the year resulted in significantly higher power costs because self generated power costs were higher than the cost of power from the ghana grid 
even though cash costs were substantially higher in total  the increase in gold output more than compensated  yielding the operating cash costs of per ounce  down from per ounce in wassa operating results ore mined t waste mined t ore and heap leach materials processed t grade processed g t recovery gold sales oz cash operating cost oz royalties oz total cash cost oz the wassa mine commenced commercial production in april  thus amount shown for are for nine months of operation while the and results reflect a full twelve months of operation 
wassa processed an averaged of  tonnes per day during at an average grade of grams per tonne with a gold recovery of  versus  tonnes per day at an average grade of grams per tonne and a recovery rate of in depreciation was higher in than re estimation of wassa reserves at december  resulted in a decrease in reserves which resulted in higher units of production depreciation during the increase in gold output also resulted in higher depreciation costs 
a feasibility study completed for the benso and hwini butre deposits in april  indicated that the ore from these two deposits located and km respectively south of wassa  should be hauled by truck to the wassa processing plant for processing 
to this end  construction of a haul road from wassa to the benso deposit was initiated in the fourth quarter of ore from the benso and hwini butre deposits is expected to extend the life of the wassa operation until at least results of operations compared to net income totaled million or per share for the twelve months ended december   versus a net loss of million or per share in while mining operations contributed million to the pre tax income versus a deficit of in  the major factor contributing to the million improvement in earnings was sales during of non core assets including our holdings of euro and moto shares 
a million pre tax gain was recognized in the first quarter of on the sale of our moto shares 
in the second quarter of a million pre tax gain was recognized upon the sale of million shares of euro and upon the resultant change in accounting method for euro following its deconsolidation 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of we sold an additional million euro shares for an additional gain of million 
royalty revenues  interest and other income contributed million to revenues  up slightly from million in offsetting the gains in was a million loss on derivatives and million of exploration project impairment write offs 
the improvement in the operating margin over is mostly due to improved gold prices 
while the number of ounces of gold sold during was essentially unchanged from  consolidated gold revenues rose by million to million 
approximately million of the increase is related to wassa s revenues in the first quarter of versus zero revenues in the first quarter of when wassa was still in its construction phase 
the remaining increase in gold revenues was related to improvements in gold prices during gold prices averaged per ounce during versus per ounce in 
table of contents total mine operations costs  as found on the statement of operations  increased to million  up from million in most of the increase reflects the fact that wassa was in service for a full twelve months in but for only for nine months in higher depreciation in versus also reflects the increased ounces produced at wassa and increases in mining equipment fleet at bogoso 
the increase in general and administrative expenses reflects an overall increase in our activities including additions to the management team and the establishment of an internal audit function 
higher share based compensation costs also contributed to the increase in general and administrative in interest expense dropped in because higher construction costs related to the bogoso sulfide expansion project led to an increase in the amount of interest capitalized 
most of the foreign exchange gains were generated from cash held in canada early in following a december equity offering 
the million in mark to market derivative loss was a result of the impact of higher gold prices on euro s forward gold price agreements for a loss of before tax of million  golden star s gold calls for a loss of million  and rand forwards for a loss of million 
as discussed above  after june   our ownership interest in euro dropped to below and we no longer recognized gains and losses on euro s forward gold price agreements 
the drop in interest expense in reflects increased amounts of interest capitalized at the bogoso sulfide expansion project during based on continued expenditures on the project 
bogoso prestea operations compared to bogoso prestea generated an million operating margin during on sales of  ounces of gold  up from a million operating margin on sales of  ounces in the major factor contributing to the improved margin at bogoso prestea was a improvement in realized gold prices from per ounce in to per ounce in this was offset by a  ounce decrease in gold production in lower ore grade from the plant north pit and lower plant throughput due to harder ores from deeper levels in the plant north pit were the major factors responsible for the lower gold output 
in addition to the gold production shown above   ounces of gold were recovered during testing and commissioning of the new bogoso sulfide processing plant s crushing  grinding and cil circuits 
the bogoso oxide processing plant processed an average of  tonnes per day in at an average grade of grams per tonne  as compared to  tonnes per day at grams per tonne in the same period in gold recovery decreased slightly to from during mostly due to the lower grade ore 
bogoso prestea s total cash costs decreased from million in to million in mainly due to reduced stripping rates as the plant north pit neared the end of its life 
while the actual spending was lower during  lower gold production led to an increase in costs per ounce resulting in a cash operating cost of per ounce versus per ounce in wassa operations compared to since wassa was in operation for only nine months in versus a full twelve months in  the operating results are not comparable 
while wassa s operating margins in the last nine months of were positive and improved in each quarter of  the total operating margin loss for the year was million 
this was a significant improvement over the million operating margin loss in the nine months of the wassa cil processing plant averaged  tonnes per day at an average grade of grams per tonne with a gold recovery of during  versus  tonnes per day at an average grade of grams per tonne and a recovery rate of in the nine months of cash operating costs averaged per ounce in or above total cash costs averaged per ounce during or over the level 
the increase in the average daily processing rate reflects correction of plant design defects encountered early in the wassa cil processing plant s life 
the improvement in operating margins is related to higher gold output during and higher gold prices 

table of contents during  wassa s operating costs remained higher than expected and ore grades were lower than expected 
at december  wassa s reserves were re estimated based on historical costs and ore grades encountered during and as a result  wassa s proven and probable mineral reserves dropped to  ounces at the end of  or approximately  ounces less than would have been expected after subtracting the ounces consumed by processing operations during development projects prestea south properties past exploration efforts have identified several new oxide ore deposits on the south end of the prestea property 
we have prepared a feasibility study on these deposits and assuming permits are received in a timely manner  oxide ore shipments from prestea south to the bogoso oxide processing plant  are scheduled to commence in early ore from the prestea south pits will be hauled by truck to the bogoso oxide processing plant 
hbb properties based on the results of the hbb feasibility study  which was completed in april  we plan to mine the hwini butre and benso deposits as satellite sources of ore to feed to our wassa processing plant 
combining these new ore bodies with the wassa operation should result in higher processed grade  higher gold output  and an extended life for the combined operation as well as an improvement in the average cash operating cost per ounce 
the four pits at the benso subriso concession are expected to be mined first 
construction commenced on the km access road between benso and wassa in mid october following receipt of environmental permits 
we expect the road construction to be completed by the third quarter of mining should commence in the third quarter of  and we anticipate that the first ore will be hauled to wassa for processing immediately afterwards 
the two higher grade deposits on the hwini butre concession are scheduled to begin mining in the second quarter of following the completion of a km access road south from the benso area 
the total capital expenditure for the development of hwini butre and benso has been estimated at approximately million of which approximately million was spent in the total capital cost for the development phase is expected to be as follows capital item in millions mining equipment haul road construction wassa processing plant modifications hwini butre benso infrastructure compensation for haul road and pits ownership payment contingency approximately total exploration projects we spent a total of million on exploration activities during  down from in our main focus in was on resource delineation at prestea south  wassa  benso  hwini butre  and at the foot wall underground target at prestea 
we also test soil and geophysical anomalies at hwini butre and at other regional licenses 
we completed an extensive helicopter borne time domain electro magnetic vtem geophysical survey at bogoso  prestea  pampe and dunkwa  along the ashanti trend 
the vtem results should help us to identify deeper drilling targets which will be tested in and in addition we continued to advance projects in sierra leone  niger  burkina faso and the ivory coast in west africa and in suriname and french guiana in south america 

table of contents exploration in ghana exploration programs at prestea south resulted in a million increase in the mineral reserves at this project 
preliminary results from initial drilling of several gold in soil geochemical targets at chichiwelli  manso and hwini butre were also encouraging and follow up work is planned in on these targets 
in addition to drilling  we also conducted extensive soil geochemical surveys at manso  sedova  kibi  takoradi north  and abura 
overall the ghana exploration activities totaled approximately million in  down from million in  and accounted for approximately of our total exploration spending 
exploration elsewhere in africa our exploration activities elsewhere in west africa included drilling in sierra leone and burkina faso and continued detailed and regional geochemical surveys in niger and ivory coast 
exploration continued on our mano river joint venture in sierra leone  with drilling at pampana and soil geochemistry and drilling at the sonfon property 
pampana drilling results were not encouraging and the property was dropped in mid but work continued at the sonfon property with additional drilling scheduled for over the last two years we have conducted regional stream and laterite sampling over the six  square kilometer prospecting and research permits in ivory coast 
these regional programs were completed in with three large anomalies being prioritized for follow up soil sampling programs which we initiated early in in burkina faso the field exploration activities involved a drilling program at rounga  a gradient induced polarization ground geophysical survey at goulagou and infill geochemistry on both these concessions 
follow up exploration on these tested targets will now be managed by riverstone resources inc who has an option to purchase these concessions 
the two niger properties were successfully renewed this year with exploration activities focusing at tialkam 
after the data compilation exercise during  priority targets were identified at tialkam central and congo tour where we established soil sampling grids and initiated mapping  soil sampling and ground geophysics 
targets identified on the deba concession will be followed up in the exploration field season 
exploration on the guiana shield golden star has over a decade of exploration experience in the guiana shield and still views this area as highly prospective 
in we renewed our exploration efforts in the guiana shield with the newmont joint venture on our suriname  saramacca properties and our regional airborne geophysical and preliminary assessment study on the paul isnard properties in french guiana 
encouraging results from a limited diamond core drilling program conducted at our saramacca property in suriname during allowed us to attract joint venture exploration funding from newmont gold corporation commencing in late drilling under this golden star managed joint venture recommenced in late following several months of geochemistry and geophysics which helped define additional drill targets 
newmont has approved expenditures of approximately million for exploration programs on the property 
the preliminary assessment of the paul isnard montage d or prospect commenced the middle of with camp refurbishment and collection of data required for this initial evaluation of the economic viability of the inferred mineral resource 
in addition to this assessment we conducted an extensive airborne geophysical survey over the paul isnard concessions to help identify additional drilling targets to be tested in exploration plans we have budgeted million for exploration in  and intend to again focus the majority of our efforts on our ghana assets 
the following table identifies the major areas for our spending 
table of contents in millions ghana existing mine sites prestea underground hwini butre  benso  manso  chichiwelli other ghana other africa south america total liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  up from million at the end of at the end of all of our cash equivalents were invested in a fund that holds only us treasury notes and bonds 
operations provided million of cash during  compared to million in changes in working capital items accounted for million of the total 
an increase in inventory was also the major factor contributing to cash use by operations in net investing activities used approximately million of cash during including million for completion of construction at the bogoso sulfide processing plant 
on going mine property development required million including completion of pre stripping at the new sulfide pits 
approximately million was spent on development activities at the new hbb project  mostly related to additional drilling and haul road construction 
a total of million of investing cash was received from three transactions related to euro 
during we sold additional euro shares for million and in december we sold our residual royalty interest in the rosebel mine to euro for million 
euro paid million as the final installment of their purchase of the rosebel royalty 
net financing activities provided million of cash during cash provided by the issuance of debt and share capital totaled million and million respectively 
the new funding was offset by a million in debt payments and debt retirement costs 
during  we issued million common shares resulting in million in net proceeds 
proceeds were used to complete the purchase and installation of a interest in an electric power station in ghana  for completion and start up of the bogoso sulfide expansion project  for development of the hbb properties  and for general corporate and working capital purposes 
in  caterpillar financial services agreed to increase our equipment facility from million to million 
at december  the caterpillar equipment financing totaled million leaving available credit of million on the facility 
on november  we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior unsecured debentures due november  the debentures 
the debentures were sold to qualified institutional buyers in the united states and on a private placement basis in canada to accredited investors 
interest on the debentures is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  beginning may  and continuing until maturity 
each debenture is  subject to certain limitations  convertible into common shares at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of debentures equal to an initial conversion price of per share subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
the debentures are not redeemable at our option 
on maturity  we may  at our option  satisfy our repayment obligation by paying the principal amount of the debentures in cash or  subject to certain limitations  by issuing that number of our common shares obtained by dividing the principal amount of the debentures outstanding by of the weighted average trading price of our common shares on the american stock exchange for the consecutive trading days ending five trading days preceding the maturity date the market price 
upon the occurrence of certain change in control transactions  the holders of the debentures may require us to purchase the debentures for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
if or more of the fair market value of any such change in control consideration consists of cash  the holders may convert their debentures and receive a number of additional common shares  which number is determined as set forth in the indenture 
the debentures are direct senior unsecured indebtedness of golden star resources ltd  ranking equally and ratably with all our other senior unsecured indebtedness  and senior to all our subordinated indebtedness 
none of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the debentures and the debentures will not limit the amount of debt that we or our subsidiaries may incur 

table of contents net proceeds were million after fees and we used million of the proceeds to retire million principal amount of convertible notes due april  we intend to use the balance of the debenture proceeds for property development and general corporate purposes 
liquidity outlook we expect that the million cash on hand at end of  amounts available under the caterpillar equipment financing facility  proceeds from a ghana share offering in february  plus cash generated from operations at wassa and bogoso prestea during will be sufficient to meet all of our cash needs 
approximately million remains to be spent on development of the hbb projects  corporate overhead  exploration and ongoing replacement of capital equipment 
we anticipate an million capital investing budget in the major items include benso development  deferred exploration  a power plant at bogoso and sustaining capital at bogoso and wassa 
during  we expect to make payments of principal and interest totaling approximately million on the equipment financing facility 
in addition  interest and principal on our bank loan is expected to total million for the year  and we plan to pay approximately million in interest on our debentures in looking ahead our objectives for include continue optimizing the bogoso sulfide processing plant to improve recoveries and availability  construction and development of the benso portion of the hbb project  with first ore scheduled to be delivered to wassa during the third quarter of  permitting of prestea south ore bodies in to provide oxide ore for the bogoso oxide processing plant  completion of the prestea underground pre feasibility study by the end of first quarter of  continued exploration drilling at bogoso prestea  wassa and the hbb properties to further evaluate their resource potential 
we are estimating gold production of  to  ounces at bogoso prestea at an average cash operating cost between and per ounce 
we expect wassa to produce approximately  to  ounces during at an average cash operating cost between and per ounce  with total production estimated between  and  ounces at an average cash operating costs between and per ounce 
as more fully disclosed in the risk factors in item a of this annual report  numerous factors could cause our estimates and expectations to be wrong or could lead to changes in our plans 
under any of these circumstances  the estimates described above could change materially 
related party transactions during we obtained legal services from a legal firm to which our chairman is of counsel 
the total value of all services purchased from this law firm during and was million and million  respectively 
our chairman did not personally perform any legal services for us during or  nor did he benefit directly or indirectly from payments for the services performed by the firm 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements reflect the application of cdn gaap  which is different in certain material respects from us gaap 
the accounting policies reflected therein are generally those applied by similarly situated mining companies in canada 
our accounting policies under cdn gaap are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that can affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
accounting policies relating to asset impairments  depreciation and amortization of mining property  plant and equipment  tax assets and site reclamation closure accruals are subject to estimates and assumptions regarding reserves  gold recoveries  future gold prices  future operating and reclamation costs and future mining activities 
decisions to write off  or not to write off  all or a portion of our investment in various properties  especially exploration properties subject to impairment analysis  are based on our judgment as to the actual value of the properties and are therefore subjective in most cases 
certain exploration properties have been found to be impaired in the past and were written off in  and we continue to retain title to certain properties after impairment write offs as future events and discoveries may ultimately prove that they have value 
listed below are the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements based on the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
ore stockpiles stockpiles represent coarse ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing 
stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tonnes of ore added and removed from the stockpile  the number of contained ounces based on assay data  and the estimated gold recovery percentage based on the expected processing method 
stockpile values are based on mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore  including a share of direct overhead and applicable depreciation  depletion and amortization relating to mining operations 
costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and are removed at the average mining cost per tonne for material processed 
stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and fed to the mill 
a adjustment of the stockpile value  based on stockpile levels at the end of  would change the carrying value of the stockpile inventory by approximately million 
impairment charges we periodically review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable from continued operation of the asset 
an asset impairment is considered to exist if the sum of all estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are less than the carrying value of the long lived asset 
the determination of expected future cash flows requires numerous estimates about the future  including gold prices  operating costs  gold recovery  reclamation spending  ore reserves and capital expenditures 
a review of bogoso prestea s and wassa s expected future cash flows as of december  indicated that there are no impairments 
mining properties mining properties and certain property plant and equipment items recorded on our financial records are amortized using a units of production method over proven and probable mineral reserves 
reserve estimates  which serve as the denominator in units of production amortization calculations  involve the exercise of subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions about future operating costs  future gold prices  continuity of mineralization  future gold recovery rates  spatial configuration of gold deposits  and other factors that may prove to be incorrect 
a adjustment in estimated total reserves at wassa and at bogoso prestea could result in an approximately to million annual change in amortization expense 
tax assets recognition of future tax assets requires an analysis of future taxable income expectations to evaluate the probability of sufficient future taxable income to utilize the accrued tax benefits 
determination of expected future taxable income requires numerous estimates of future variable including but not limited to  gold prices  operating costs  gold recovery  ore reserves  gold production  ore grades  administrative costs  tax rates  and potential changes in tax laws 
asset retirement obligation and reclamation expenditures accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates at each mining operation of reclamation and closure costs to be incurred in the future as required to complete the reclamation and environmental remediation work mandated by existing laws  regulations and customs 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required 
based upon our current situation  we estimate that a increases in total future reclamation and closure costs would result in an approximately to million increase in our asset retirement obligations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk includes  but is not limited to  the following risks changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio and debt  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity price fluctuations and equity price risk 
interest rate risk our excess cash is typically invested in high quality short term debt instruments 
the interest rates received on such investments fluctuate with changes in economic conditions 
as a result  our investment income may fall short of expectations during periods of lower interest rates 
we estimate that  given the cash balances expected during  a change in interest rates would not materially impact our annual income 
we currently have a debt with a variable interest rate 
the impact of a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows 
we do not utilize interest rate sensitive derivatives to mitigate interest rate risk 
we have not entered into any agreements to hedge against unfavorable changes in interest rates  but may in the future actively manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk while our major operating units transact most of their business in us dollars  certain purchases of labor  operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in euros  british pounds  australian dollars  south african rand and ghanaian cedi 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations have in the past and may continue in the future to impact the costs of goods and services purchased in currencies other than the us dollar 
the appreciation of non us dollar currencies against the us dollar increases the costs of goods and services purchased in non us dollar terms  which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows 
conversely  a depreciation of non us dollar currencies against the us dollar usually decreases the costs of goods and services purchased in us dollar terms 
the value of cash and cash equivalent investments denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates 
appreciation of non us dollar currencies results in a foreign currency gain on such investments and a decrease in non us dollar currencies results in a loss 
in certain situations in the past we have utilized market risk sensitive instruments to manage exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
during and we entered into forward purchase contracts for the south african rand and euros to hedge expected future purchases of capital assets in south africa and europe associated mostly with the bogoso sulfide expansion project 
at various times we also hold portions of our cash reserves in non us dollar currencies 
at december   we held forward currency purchase contracts for south african rand equal to million for a specific purchase 
these forward agreements expire by april we do not anticipate using foreign currency purchase agreement on a regular basis 
commodity price risk gold is our primary product and  as a result  changes in the price of gold could significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows 
according to current estimates  a per ounce change in our average realized price of gold for would result in a to million change in pre tax earnings and cash flows 

table of contents during and  to reduce the risk of unfavorable gold price fluctuations on our operating cash flows during the construction period of the bogoso sulfide expansion project  we purchased puts to lock in minimum gold prices for portions of our expected gold sales in  and as of december  we had no puts  calls or other gold price derivatives 
equity price risk we have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire additional funding by sale of common shares 
movements in the price of our common shares have been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future 
as a result  there is a risk that we may not be able to sell new common shares at an acceptable price should the need for new equity funding arise
