table of contents the following table presents certain information regarding the delinquency rates experienced by the company with respect to contracts and under its direct loan program at march  at march  at march  contracts gross balance outstanding delinquencies dollar amount percent dollar amount percent dollar amount percent days days days total delinquencies direct loans gross balance outstanding delinquencies days days days total delinquencies critical accounting policy the company s critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for losses on loans 
it is based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio 
the allowance for credit losses is established through allocations of dealer discount and a provision for loss based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio  the composition of the portfolio  specific impaired loans and current economic conditions 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans on which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  management s estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate credit loss allowance 
because of the nature of the customers under the company s contracts and its direct loan program  the company considers the establishment of adequate reserves for credit losses to be imperative 
the company segregates its contracts into static pools for purposes of establishing reserves for losses 
all contracts purchased by a branch during a fiscal quarter comprise a static pool 
the company pools contracts according to branch location because the branches purchase contracts in different geographic markets 
this method of pooling by branch and quarter allows the company to evaluate the different markets where the branches operate 
the pools also allow the company to evaluate the different levels of customer income  stability  credit history  and the types of vehicles purchased in each market 
each such static pool consists of the contracts purchased by a branch office during the fiscal quarter 

table of contents contracts are purchased from many different dealers and are all purchased on an individual contract by contract basis 
individual contract pricing is determined by the automobile dealerships and is generally the lesser of state maximum interest rates or the maximum interest rate at which the customer will accept 
in certain markets  competitive forces will drive down contract rates from the maximum rate to a level where an individual competitor is willing to buy an individual contract 
the company only buys contracts on an individual basis and never purchases contracts in batches  although the company does consider portfolio acquisitions as part of its growth strategy 
the company has detailed underwriting guidelines it utilizes to determine which contracts to purchase 
these guidelines are specific and are designed to cause all of the contracts that the company purchases to have common risk characteristics 
the company utilizes its district managers to evaluate their respective branch locations for adherence to these underwriting guidelines 
the company also utilizes an internal audit department to assure adherence to its underwriting guidelines 
the company utilizes the branch model  which allows for contract purchasing to be done on the branch level 
each branch manager may interpret the guidelines differently  and as a result  the common risk characteristics tend to be the same on an individual branch level but not necessarily compared to another branch 
a dealer discount represents the difference between the finance receivable  net of unearned interest  of a contract  and the amount of money the company actually pays for the contract 
the discount negotiated by the company is a function of the credit quality of the customer and the wholesale value of the vehicle 
the automotive dealer accepts these terms by executing a dealer agreement with the company 
the entire amount of discount is related to credit quality and is considered to be part of the credit loss reserve 
the company utilizes a static pool approach to track portfolio performance 
a static pool retains an amount equal to of the discount as a reserve for credit losses 
subsequent to the purchase  if the reserve for credit losses is determined to be inadequate for a static pool which is not fully liquidated  then an additional charge to income through the provision is used to reestablish adequate reserves 
for static pools not fully liquidated that are deemed to have excess reserves  such amounts are then considered when calculating the provision for credit losses on specific pools 
if a static pool is fully liquidated and has any remaining reserves  these excess reserves are immediately reversed during the period 
in analyzing a static pool  the company considers the performance of prior static pools originated by the branch office  the performance of prior contracts purchased from the dealers whose contracts are included in the current static pool  the credit rating of the customers under the contracts in the static pool  and current market and economic conditions 
each static pool is analyzed monthly to determine if the loss reserves are adequate and adjustments are made if they are determined to be necessary

the primary reason for the decrease in reserves accreted during the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  was an increase in the net charge off percentage from to

the company does not believe there have been any significant changes in loan concentrations  terms or quality of contracts purchased during fiscal that would have contributed to the increase in losses 

table of contents recoveries as a percentage of charge offs were and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the company believes that as it continues to expand its operations  it will become more difficult to implement its loss recovery model in geographic areas further away from its corporate headquarters  and as a result the company will likely experience declining recovery rates over the long term 
recovery rates are also influenced by general economic conditions and as a result the year ended march  experienced recovery rates that were below historical averages 
the company considers the following factors to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels  unemployment rates  the number of bankruptcy filings  the results of internal branch audits  consumer sentiment  consumer spending  economic growth gdp  condition of the housing sector and other leading economic indicators 
as a result of weakness in the overall economy  the company has increased its targeted reserve levels on static pools originated since september  and the company continues to re evaluate reserve levels on a pool by pool basis during each reporting period 
the delinquency percentage for contracts more than thirty days past due as of march  increased to from as of march  the delinquency percentage for direct loans more than thirty days past due as of march  increased to from as of march  the company utilizes a static pool approach to analyzing portfolio performance and looks at specific static pool performance and recent trends as leading indicators to future performance of the portfolio 
the company has experienced a material increase in the net charge off rate from in fiscal to in fiscal as a result of this increase  the company has increased its targeted reserve levels on all static pools originated since april for the year ended march  the provision for credit losses increased to million versus million for the year ended march  this increase was necessary  even though gross receivables only increased for the year  to properly reflect an allowance for credit losses that management believes will be adequate based on the current loss environment 
the primary reasons for the increase in the charge off rate are attributable to a material increase in the price of oil  which has lead to higher prices for the cost of gasoline  food and other items used on a weekly basis by our customers 
the company has also seen many of its customers who have either lost their jobs  had their hours cut back or have been unable to maintain second part time jobs in order to meet their debt obligations 
the company is also experiencing a recent increase in the number of bankruptcy filings 
the company does not see any catalyst to change these dynamics in the short term and anticipates charge off s continuing to rise during fiscal year the company has not seen any evidence that its increase in the charge off rate is related to deviations in its underwriting guidelines or fundamental business execution policies

table of contents the us unemployment rate has dropped slightly over the past year 
the company believes there is a correlation between the unemployment rate and future portfolio performance 
the company does not expect the us unemployment rate to rise or fall significantly in the foreseeable future 
therefore the company does not plan on increasing or decreasing reserves based on the current us unemployment rate 
the company also analyzes bankruptcy filings  voluntary repossession rates and the results of internal branch audits to measure the credit quality of its respective branches as other tools to predict future portfolio performance 
these indicators have not changed materially in the past year and the company does not anticipate any change to reserve levels as such 
the delinquency percentage for contracts more than thirty days past due as of march  increased to from as of march  the delinquency percentage for direct loans more than thirty days past due as of march  decreased to from as of march  the company does not give significant consideration to short term trends in delinquency when evaluating reserve levels 
delinquency percentages tend to be volatile and are not necessarily an indication of future losses 
the company utilizes a static pool approach to analyzing portfolio performance and looks at specific static pool performance and recent trends as leading indicators to future performance of the portfolio 
income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in fiscal year primarily as a result of higher pretax income 
the company s effective tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flows are summarized as follows fiscal year ended march  cash provided by used in operations investing activities primarily purchase of contracts financing activities net decrease increase in cash the company s primary use of working capital during fiscal year ended march  was the funding of the purchase of contracts 
the contracts were financed substantially through borrowings under the company s million line 
the line is secured by all of the assets of nicholas financial 
the company may borrow the lesser of million or amounts based upon formulas principally related to a percentage of eligible finance receivables  as defined 
borrowings under the line may be under various libor pricing options or at the prime rate 
prime rate based borrowings are generally less than million 
as of march   the amount outstanding under the line was approximately million and the amount available under the line was approximately million 

table of contents the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements  each of which effectively converts a portion of the company s floating rate debt to a fixed rate  thus reducing the impact of interest rate change on the company s interest expense 
at march   approximately of the company s borrowings under the line were subject to interest rate swap agreements 
these swap agreements have maturities ranging from may  through february  the self liquidating nature of contracts and other loans enables the company to assume a higher debt to equity ratio than in most businesses 
the amount of debt the company incurs from time to time under these financing mechanisms depends on the company s need for cash and ability to borrow under the terms of the line 
the company believes that borrowings available under the line as well as cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short term funding needs 
impact of inflation the company is affected by inflation primarily through increased operating costs and expenses including increases in interest rates 
inflationary pressures on operating costs and expenses have been offset by the company s continued emphasis on stringent operating and cost controls 
management believes that the company s financial condition has enabled it to negotiate favorable interest rates under its existing line 
no assurances can be given that the company will be able to continue to do so in the future

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk management s objective is to minimize the cost of borrowing through an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swap agreements  may be used for the purpose of managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from ongoing business operations 
there was no ineffectiveness associated with the interest rate swap agreements during the year ended march
