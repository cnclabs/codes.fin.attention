item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december   and the related notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada 
reference to note to the consolidated financial statements should be made for a discussion of differences between canadian and united states gaap and their effect on the financial statements 
all amounts stated herein are in us dollars in thousands  except loss per share  and gold price per ounce  unless specified otherwise 
overview we are engaged in the evaluation  acquisition  exploration and advancement of gold exploration and potential development projects with the aim of adding value to the projects 
our approach to acquisitions of gold projects has generally been to seek projects within political jurisdictions with well established mining  land ownership and tax laws  which have adequate drilling and geological data to support the completion of a third party review of the geological data and to complete an estimate of the mineralized material 
in addition  we look for opportunities to improve the value of our gold projects through ways including exploration drilling and re engineering the operating assumptions underlying previous engineering work 
beginning in  our board of directors and management have decided to take on a new direction regarding our more advanced projects 
the more advanced projects will move forward through advanced and pre feasibility studies  so production decisions can be made on those projects 
our holdings include the paredones amarillos and guadalupe de los reyes projects in mexico  the mt 
todd gold mine in australia  the yellow pine project in idaho  the awak mas project in indonesia  the amayapampa project in bolivia  and claims located in colorado and utah 
we also own approximately of the shares of zamora gold corp  a company exploring for gold in ecuador 
on may   the arrangement involving vista  allied nevada and the pescios pursuant to the arrangement agreement between the parties  was completed 
the transaction resulted in  among other things  the acquisition by allied nevada of vista s nevada based properties and the nevada mineral assets of the pescios 
see consolidated financial statements note 
outlook gold prices started at per ounce and finished the year at per ounce as quoted on the london exchange 
this rise of approximately during the year reflected factors such as rising oil prices  global instability  real and threatened terrorism activities  the war in iraq  and the rise in demand for investment and jewelry 
current prices are at a year high and no assurance can be given that such prices will be sustained 
at the end of  we owned or controlled seven properties containing mineralized material 
in the early part of  we decided with the higher gold prices  to bring the more advanced projects  such as paredones amarillos and mt 
todd  to a production decision 
the emphasis in late was to start a bankable feasibility study on paredones amarillos with a major mining consultant being contracted to manage this study  which we expect to be completed by the middle of in addition  through exploration drilling and engineering studies  we believe that additional value can be added to most of the remaining projects by advancing them closer to a production decision 
we do not currently generate operating cash flows 
subject to sustained gold prices  we expect to generate revenues and cash flows in the future 
we may generate revenues and cash flows from our portfolio of gold projects by several means  including but not limited to options or leases to third parties  joint venture arrangements with other gold producers  outright sales for cash and or royalties  or project development and operation 
with respect to our current property holdings  aggregate expenditures for purchase installments  to maintain options and conduct exploration activities are currently anticipated being approximately in and in at present  we would anticipate raising funds to meet these long term obligations through public or private debt and or equity offerings  or joint venture efforts or sale of properties currently controlled 
we anticipate raising funds for interim financing needs through various bridge loan or convertible debt alternatives see subsequent events brokered private placement of convertible notes  below 
in subsequent years  we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to meet property purchase installment obligations and scheduled payments on those properties that we decide to retain under option 
further  additional capital would be necessary to advance the projects to a positive production decisions  and to conduct additional exploration drilling and engineering studies on current properties 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in efforts to raise additional capital 
results from operations summary our consolidated net loss was  or per share compared to the consolidated net loss of  or per share for a net increase of  the increase of  in is primarily the result of the impairment of the amayapampa project of  costs related to the completion of the arrangement of  increased corporate administration and investor relations costs of  and increased exploration  property evaluation and holdings costs of our consolidated net loss was  or per share compared to the consolidated net loss of  or per share for a net decrease of the decrease of in is primarily due to increased interest income of  increased other income of  decreased exploration  evaluation and holding costs of and decreased corporate administration and investor relations costs of  partially offset by an increased loss from discontinued operations of exploration  property evaluation and holding costs exploration  property evaluation and holding costs increased to during the year ended december   compared with for the same period in the increase of is primarily due to an increase in holding costs at the paredones amarillos project of the increase reflects increasing consultant fees for activities related to permitting and other administrative work and accounting fees as we evaluate financial and tax implications to vista as we move the project towards a development decision 
the remaining increase can be attributed to vista s increased business development efforts following the completion of the arrangement 
exploration  property evaluation and holding costs decreased to during the year ended december   compared with for the same period in the slight decrease is primarily due to less business development as a result of focusing our efforts on the arrangement 
corporate administration and investor relations corporate administration and investor relations costs increased to  during the year ended december   compared to  in the increase of  from the prior period is primarily due to the following an increase in stock based compensation expense of  compared to the prior period 
this is due to an increase of for options vesting immediately upon the grant date  an increase of from the prior year for options granted and vesting over time and a decrease of in the allocation of stock based compensation expense to allied nevada during the period  a decrease in the allocation of certain corporate expenses to allied nevada as part of the arrangement of see consolidated financial statements note compared to the prior period  an increase in labor and benefit costs of compared to the prior period 
this increase is due to the addition of employees as we head towards anticipated development of certain projects  and an increase in investor relations costs of compared to prior period 
this increase is due to our participation in additional gold conferences during corporate administration and investor relations costs decreased to  during the year ended december   compared to  in the principal variance pertaining to the comparative twelve month period in was an increase in the allocation of certain corporate expenses to allied nevada as part of the arrangement of see consolidated financial statements note compared to the prior period 
this was offset by increases during in the following we paid to an outside consultant  to assist with our compliance with internal control over financial reporting and related requirements under section of the sarbanes oxley act of audit and tax fees increased as compared to the increase is mostly due to additional audit fees related to requirements under section of the sarbanes oxley act of compliance fees increased as compared to the increase is mostly due to increased regulatory filing fees due to increased regulatory filings throughout the year 
the remaining variance can be attributed to higher labor costs in as compared with  which is partially offset by decreased investor relations costs in due to a mass mailing that was completed during costs associated with the arrangement on may   the arrangement was completed resulting in  among other things  the transfer of our nevada related assets to allied nevada 
when the transaction was completed there was  in prepaid transaction costs which were expensed upon completion of the arrangement 
since the completion of the arrangement  we incurred an additional in expenses related to the arrangement that were immediately expensed as costs associated with the arrangement 
impairment of mineral property on november   the corporation announced that luzon had decided not to exercise its option to acquire its interest in the amayapampa project  citing luzon s inability to advance the project with its current financial and personnel resources 
since the termination of this agreement the corporation has been actively engaged in locating another buyer for the amayapampa project and accepting proposals from other interested companies  and therefore  at year end  it was determined that the amayapampa project was held for sale 
upon making this determination  the corporation assessed the fair market value of the amayapampa project using economic models incorporating the terms of an arm s length proposal to purchase the amayapampa project currently under consideration by the corporation 
the models employed various production scenarios  a gold price of per ounce and discount rates of and reflecting management s assessment of the risks associated with the development 
the average of these calculations indicated a fair market value for the amayapampa project of  at december  as compared to the carrying value of  for the amayapampa project which necessitated a write down to fair market value of  this write down has been classified as a loss from discontinued operations as the asset has been determined to be held for sale 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased to during the twelve month period ended december  as compared to for the same period in this increase is mostly due to capital expenditures at the mt 
todd gold mine during that have begun being depreciated 
depreciation and amortization was approximately in and in there was no significant change in the depreciation and amortization costs from the previous year 
other income and expenses gain on disposal of marketable securities in  we realized a gain on disposal of marketable securities of  compared to a gain of in in  we realized a gain on disposal of marketable securities of  compared to a gain of in in the gain on disposal of marketable securities was the result of selling certain available for sale securities that had a book value of for proceeds of we allocated of the gain on disposal of marketable securities to allied nevada as part of the completion of the arrangement see consolidated financial statements note 
these costs were allocated as part of the general overhead income and expense allocation 
in the gain on disposal of marketable securities was the result of selling certain available for sale securities that had a book value of for proceeds of we allocated of the gain on disposal of marketable securities to allied nevada as part of the completion of the arrangement see consolidated financial statements note 
these costs were allocated as part of the general overhead income and expense allocation 
in the gain on disposal of marketable securities was the result of selling certain available for sale securities that had a book value of for proceeds of at december   we held marketable securities available for sale with a quoted market value of  with the exception of our shares of allied nevada common stock  as discussed herein  we purchased the securities for investing purposes with the intent to hold the securities until such time it would be advantageous to sell the securities at a gain 
although there can be no reasonable assurance that a gain will be realized from the sale of the securities  we monitor the market status of the securities consistently in order to mitigate the risk of loss on the investment 
at december   also included in marketable securities were  shares of allied nevada at a quoted market value of  we continue to hold these shares of allied nevada  which we retained as part of the closing of the arrangement to facilitate payment of any taxes payable by vista as a result of the arrangement 
these shares are restricted securities as defined in rule under the securities act of the securities act and cannot be resold by us in the absence of registration under the securities act unless an exemption from registration is available 
we cannot be certain of whether or when the shares would be registered under the securities act 
the most commonly available exemption for resales  rule under the securities act  would require us to hold these shares for a specified period before commencing the resales 
on november   the sec adopted proposed revisions to rule that  among other things  shortened the one year holding period under rule to six months as to restricted securities issued by companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act  such as allied nevada 
the revisions to rule became effective on february  since we acquired our allied nevada shares in may  we have met the required six month holding period and can commence resales in reliance on the rule exemption 
if there are no taxes to be paid as part of the arrangement  then we will hold these shares until such time that it would be advantageous to sell the securities at a gain 
interest income during   and  we did not incur any interest expense as we had no commercial debt during these years 
during the respective years ended december   and  we realized  and in interest income 
the increases are the result of an increase in interest earned on our liquid savings account for both and  the increased interest earned on our liquid savings account can be attributed to higher cash balances that became available to be invested during the respective periods due to private placement financings and stock option and warrant exercises 
bad debt expense as part of the termination of the option agreement relating to the amayapampa project  luzon was to pay to the corporation of which is payable in cash and the remaining is to be converted into  fully paid and non assessable common shares in the capital of luzon  subject to regulatory approval 
subsequently  after reviewing the collectability of this receivable  we have determined that the repayment of the in cash and the issuance of the shares is doubtful 
vista has provided an allowance for the full amount of this receivable based on the doubtfulness that we will ultimately collect these amounts from luzon 
other expense during the remaining  luzon warrants expired and were written off 
in  we had been granted  warrants  valued at using the black scholes pricing model  each to purchase one common share of luzon as partial payment towards their option to purchase the amayapampa mine

the remaining warrants expired and the corresponding value was expensed

significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements significant accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in canada requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant areas requiring the use of estimates include mine closure and reclamation obligations  useful lives for asset depreciation purposes  impairment of mineral properties and stock based compensation 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
mineral properties mineral property acquisition costs and exploration costs are recorded at cost and are deferred until the viability of the property is determined 
general overhead  administrative and holding costs to maintain a property on a care and maintenance basis are expensed in the period they are incurred 
if a project would be put into production  capitalized costs would be depleted on the unit of production basis 
option payments and reimbursements received are treated as a recovery of mineral property costs 
option payments are at the discretion of the optionee and accordingly are accounted for on a cash basis or when receipt is reasonably assured 
our management regularly reviews the net carrying value of each mineral property 
where information and conditions suggest impairment  estimated future cash flows are calculated using estimated future prices  proven and probable reserves  weighted probable outcomes and operating capital and reclamation costs on an undiscounted basis 
if it is determined that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  a write down to the estimated fair value is made with a charge to loss for the period 
where estimates of future net cash flows are not available and where other conditions suggest impairment  management assesses if carrying values can be recovered 
asset retirement obligation and closure costs the fair value of a liability for our legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets is recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset unless the asset has been previously written off  in which case the amount is expensed 
the fair value of the legal obligation for asset retirement is assessed at the end of each reporting period 
where we have an insurance policy in place to cover changes in the legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets which have previously been expensed  increased to the fair value of such obligations are recognized at the end of the period with a corresponding amount recorded as an amount recoverable from the insurance company 
stock based compensation and other stock based payments the corporation records compensation expense on the granting of all stock based compensation awards  including stock options grants to employees  calculated using the fair value method 
the corporation uses the hull white trinomial method of determining the fair value of the option on the date of the grant 
when an employee or non employee is granted stock options  the fair value of the immediately vested portion is expensed and included within the stock options balance within equity 
as to the options vesting  the fair value is amortized using the straight line method over the vesting period and expensed on a monthly basis 
when an employee or non employee exercises stock options  then the fair value of the options on the date of the grant is transferred to common stock 
when options are cancelled  the vested fair value balance of the stock options is transferred to contributed surplus 
when stock options are forfeited prior to becoming fully vested  any expense and fair value previously recorded are reversed out accordingly 
when options expire  the related fair value istransferred to contributed surplus 
financial instruments effective january   the corporation adopted cica handbook sections  comprehensive income   financial instruments recognition and measurement and  financial instruments disclosure and presentation 
the adoption of these new sections had no impact on the corporation s financial statements on or before december  as the sections require adjustments to the carrying value of available for sale securities to be recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income on transition 
upon adoption of these sections  the corporation made a one time adjustment to the opening balance  as of january   of accumulated other comprehensive income in the amount of all available for sale securities are measured at fair value 
gains and losses associated with these available for sale securities will be separately recorded as unrealized within other comprehensive income until such time the security is disposed of or becomes impaired  at which time any gains or losses will then be realized and reclassified to the statement of loss 
upon adoption of the new section financial instruments  all regular way purchases of financial assets are accounted for at trade date 
transaction costs on financial assets are treated as part of the investment cost 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the cica issued section  financial instruments disclosures and section  financial instruments presentations 
these two standards replace section  financial instruments disclosure and presentation  revising disclosures related to financial instruments and carry forward unchanged presentation requirements 
upon adoption of these standards  entities will be required to provide quantitative and qualitative disclosures in the financial statements that enable users to evaluate the significance of financial instruments to the entity s financial position and performance and the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments 
the standard also requires disclosure regarding management s objectives and the related policies and procedures established for managing risks associated with financial instruments 
entities will be required to disclose the measurement basis or bases used  and the criteria used to determine the classification of different types of instruments 
the standard requires specific disclosures to be made regarding the designation of financial assets and liabilities as held for trading or available for sale 
disclosure is also required upon determination of impairment of the related financial asset or the use of an allowance account 
this standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after october  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard in in december  the cica issued section  capital disclosures  which establishes standards for disclosing information about an entity s capital and how the entity manages its capital 
this section will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after october  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard in in january  the cica issued section  inventories  which provides guidance on the determination of costs and its subsequent recognition as an expense  and provides guidance on the cost formulas used to assign costs to inventories 
this standard also prescribes the accounting treatment for the write down of inventory to net realizable value 
this standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after january  we do not believe  at this time  that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the cica issued section  goodwill and intangible assets  which replaces section  goodwill and intangible assets  and results in a withdrawal of cica section  research and development costs  and amendments to accounting guideline acg  enterprises in the development stage  and cica section  financial statement concepts 
the standard intends to reduce the differences with international financial reporting standards ifrs in the accounting for intangible assets and results in closer alignment with us gaap 
under current canadian standards  more items are recognized as assets than under ifrs or us gaap 
the objectives of cica section are to reinforce the principle based approach to the recognition of assets only in accordance with the definition of an asset and the criteria for asset recognition  and clarify the application of the concept of matching revenues and expenses such that the current practice of recognizing assets that do not meet the definition and recognition criteria are eliminated 
the standard will also provide guidance for the recognition of internally developed intangible assets including research and development activities  ensuring consistent treatment of all intangible assets  whether separately acquired or internally developed 
this standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after october  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are engaged in the acquisition of gold projects and related activities including exploration engineering  permitting and the preparation of feasibility studies 
the value of our properties is related to gold price and changes in the price of gold could affect our ability to generate revenue from our portfolio of gold projects 
gold prices may fluctuate widely from time to time and are affected by numerous factors  including the following expectations with respect to the rate of inflation  exchange rates  interest rates  global and regional political and economic circumstances and governmental policies  including those with respect to gold holdings by central banks 
the demand for  and supply of  gold affect gold prices  but not necessarily in the same manner as demand and supply affect the prices of other commodities 
the supply of gold consists of a combination of new mine production and existing stocks of bullion and fabricated gold held by governments  public and private financial institutions  industrial organizations and private individuals 
the demand for gold primarily consists of jewelry and investments 
additionally  hedging activities by producers  consumers  financial institutions and individuals can affect gold supply and demand 
while gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world  its market value cannot be predicted for any particular time 
because we have several exploration operations in north america and south america  australia and in asia  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not engage in currency hedging to offset any risk of currency fluctuations as insignificant monetary amounts are held for immaterial land holding costs related to the properties owned 
as of december   we had no debt outstanding  nor do we have any investment in debt instruments other than highly liquid short term investments 
on march   we announced the closing of a private placement in which we offered and sold million in aggregate principal amount of secured senior convertible notes 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum calculated and payable semi annually in arrears and will mature on march  we do not consider our interest rate risk exposure to be significant at this time
