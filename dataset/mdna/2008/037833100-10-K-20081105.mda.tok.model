item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under the subheading gross margin  which is incorporated herein by reference 
the company and other participants in the personal computer  consumer electronics and mobile communication industries compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products 
the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer  consumer electronics or mobile communication industries 
the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for  and subsequently qualifies  additional suppliers 
when a component or product uses new technologies  initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured 
continued availability of these components at acceptable prices  or at all  may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements 
if the supply of a key single sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained  if such components were available only at significantly higher prices  or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company  the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties  many of whom are located outside of the us most of the company s components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few third party manufacturers 
many of these manufacturers are located outside of the us  and are geographically concentrated 
table of contents in single locations 
the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management 
while these arrangements may lower operating costs  they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution 
it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services  or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions 
in addition  the company relies on third party manufacturers to adhere to the company s supplier code of conduct 
although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement  the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects 
any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability  whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company s reputation  financial condition and operating results 
final assembly of the company s products is currently performed in the company s manufacturing facility in ireland  and by external vendors in california  korea  china and the czech republic 
currently  the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole sourced third party vendors in the us  china  japan  korea  malaysia  philippines  taiwan  thailand and singapore 
sole sourced third party vendors in china perform final assembly of substantially all of the company s portable products  including macbook pro  macbook  macbook air  ipods  iphones and most of the company s imacs 
if manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason  including natural disasters  information technology system failures  military actions or economic  business  labor  environmental  public health  or political issues  the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the company relies on third party digital content  which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the company contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content through the company s itunes store 
the company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to audio and video content 
the company s licensing arrangements with these third parties are short term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms  if at all 
some third party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services  and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license their content in the future 
other content owners  providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to  or increase the total cost of  such content 
if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules  or continue to expand its geographic reach  the company s financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 
many third party content providers require that the company provide certain digital rights management drm and other security solutions 
if these requirements change  the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions 
there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner 
in addition  certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm  which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the company s content providers 
the company relies on access to third party patents and intellectual property  and the company s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights 
many of the company s products are designed to include third party intellectual property  and in the future the company may need to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods 
although the company believes that  based on past experience and industry practice  such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms  there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all 
because of technological changes in the global personal computer  consumer electronics and mobile communication industries  current extensive patent coverage  and the rapid issuance of new patents  it is possible that certain components of the company s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
from time to time  the company has been notified that it may be infringing such rights 
regardless of merit  responding to such claims can consume significant time and 
table of contents expense 
at present  the company is vigorously defending more than patent infringement cases  of which were filed during fiscal  and several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation 
in certain cases  the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements  although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur 
if the company is found to be infringing such rights  it may be required to pay substantial damages 
if there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the company requires it to pay royalties to a third party  the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected  regardless of whether it can develop non infringing technology 
while in management s opinion the company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any known current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results  the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period  the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
with the june introduction of iphone  the company has begun to compete with mobile communication device companies that hold significant patent portfolios 
regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or the merits of any potential patent claims by competitors  the company may have to engage in protracted litigation  enter into expensive agreements or settlements and or modify its products 
any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company s future performance depends on support from third party software developers 
if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products  customers may choose not to buy the company s products 
the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products  including its macs  ipods and iphones  are often based to a certain extent on the availability of third party software applications and services 
there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the company s products on a timely basis or at all  and discontinuance or delay of these applications and services could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
with respect to its mac products  the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing  maintaining  and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products 
this analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products  the anticipated revenue that may be generated  continued acceptance by customers of mac os x  and the costs of developing such applications and services 
if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the company s prospects  developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market 
the company s development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of third party developers  such as microsoft  adobe  and google  to develop  maintain  and upgrade similar or competitive software and services for the company s products 
mac os x leopard  which became available in october  includes a new feature that enables intel based mac systems to run microsoft windows xp and windows vista operating systems 
this feature may deter developers from creating software applications for mac os x if such applications are already available for the windows platform 
with respect to iphone and ipod touch  the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications 
as with applications for the company s mac products  the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the company s products rather than its competitors  including devices that use competing platforms 
if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms  the availability and quality of applications for the company s devices may suffer 

table of contents the company s products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin 
the company sells highly complex hardware and software products and services that can contain defects in design and manufacture 
sophisticated operating system software and applications  such as those sold by the company  often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation 
defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware  software and services it sells 
failure to do so could result in lost revenue  harm to reputation  and significant warranty and other expenses  and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons 
the company s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels 
the company s software  accessories  and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products 
gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions  pricing and configuration changes  and component  warranty  and other cost fluctuations 
the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners 
in addition  the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages  as well as overall profitability  may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product  geographic or channel mix  new products  component cost increases  or price competition 
the company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year  respectively 
furthermore  the company sells more products from time to time during the third month of a quarter than it does during either of the first two months 
developments late in a quarter  such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products  an internal systems failure  or failure of one of the company s key logistics  components supply  or manufacturing partners  could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
in certain countries  including the us  the company relies on a single cellular network carrier to provide service for iphone 
in the us  us  france  germany  spain  ireland  and certain other countries  the company has contracted with a single carrier to provide cellular network services for iphone on an exclusive basis 
if these exclusive carriers cannot successfully compete with other carriers in their markets for any reason  including but not limited to the quality and coverage of wireless voice and data services  performance and timely build out of advanced wireless networks  and pricing and other terms of conditions of end user contracts  or if these exclusive carriers fail to promote iphone aggressively or favor other handsets in their promotion and sales activities or service plans  sales may be materially adversely affected 
the company is subject to risks associated with laws  regulations and industry imposed standards related to mobile communications devices 
laws and regulations related to mobile communications devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change 
such changes  which could include but are not limited to restrictions on production  manufacture  distribution  and use of the device  locking the device to a carrier s network  or mandating the use of the device on more than one carrier s network  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
mobile communication devices  such as iphone  are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies  as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks 
these certification processes are extensive and time consuming  and could result in additional testing requirements  product modifications or delays in product shipment dates  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 

table of contents the company may be subject to information technology system failures  network disruptions and breaches in data security 
information technology system failures  network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt the company s operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer  including channel partner  orders  negatively affecting the company s online offerings and services  impeding the manufacture or shipment of products  processing transactions and reporting financial results  resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or company information  or damage to the company s reputation 
while management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures  there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company s stock price continues to be volatile 
the company s stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results  announcements by the company and its competitors  or uncertainty about current global economic conditions 
the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance 
furthermore  the company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations 
if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline 
political events  war  terrorism  public health issues  natural disasters and other circumstances could materially adversely affect the company 
war  terrorism  geopolitical uncertainties  public health issues  and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy  and thus could have a strong negative effect on the company  its suppliers  logistics providers  manufacturing vendors and customers  including channel partners 
the company s business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters  fire  power shortages  terrorist attacks  and other hostile acts  labor disputes  public health issues  and other events beyond its control 
such events could decrease demand for the company s products  make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers  including channel partners  or to receive components from its suppliers  and create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain 
should major public health issues  including pandemics  arise  the company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions  additional limitations in freight services  governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions  delays in production ramps of new products  and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers 
the majority of the company s research and development activities  its corporate headquarters  information technology systems  and other critical business operations  including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors  are located near major seismic faults 
because the company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake related losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations  the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 
the company s success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel 
much of the company s future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel  including its ceo  its executive team and key employees in technical  marketing and staff positions 
experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense  especially in the silicon valley  where most of the company s key employees are located 
the company has relied on equity awards as one means for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent 
accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options have resulted in increased stock based compensation expense  which has caused the company to reduce the number of stock based awards issued to employees and could negatively impact the company s ability to attract and retain key personnel 
additionally  significant adverse volatility in the company s stock price could result in a stock option s exercise price exceeding the underlying stock s market value or a significant deterioration in the value of restricted stock units rsus granted  thus lessening the 
table of contents effectiveness of retaining employees through stock based awards 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel 
unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the company 
the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of its business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future 
results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
regardless of its merit  litigation may be both time consuming and disruptive to the company s operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention 
in recognition of these considerations  the company may enter into material settlements 
should the company fail to prevail in certain matters  or should several of these matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period  the company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that would materially adversely affect a portion of its business and might materially affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations 
the company derives a large and growing portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations 
as a result  its financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities  including economic and labor conditions  political instability  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries  and changes in the value of the us dollar versus local currencies 
margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries  and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers  could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations  including tariffs and antidumping penalties 
the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non us dollar denominated sales in europe  japan  australia  canada  and certain parts of asia  as well as non us dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world 
weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will adversely affect the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings  and generally will lead the company to raise international pricing  potentially reducing demand for the company s products 
in some circumstances  due to competition or other reasons  the company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollar s strengthening  or at all  which would adversely affect the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings 
conversely  a strengthening of foreign currencies  while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings  could cause the company to reduce international pricing  thereby limiting the benefit 
as strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies 
the company has used derivative instruments  such as foreign exchange forward and option positions  to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 
the company s retail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
through september   the company had opened retail stores 
the company s retail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements  information systems  inventory  and personnel 
the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with terms ranging from to years  the majority of which are for years 
certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities 
because of their unique design elements  locations and size  these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores 
due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment  a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs  write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements  and severance costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 

table of contents many factors unique to retail operations  some of which are beyond the company s control  pose risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the retail segment s future results  cause its actual results to differ from anticipated results and have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
these risks and uncertainties include  among other things  macro economic factors that could have a negative effect on general retail activity  as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation  inability to sell third party products at adequate margins  failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners  more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the us  costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory  and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost 
investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated 
the company has invested  and in the future may invest  in new business strategies or acquisitions 
such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties  including distraction of management from current operations  insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy  inadequate return of capital  and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence 
because these new ventures are inherently risky  no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company s future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors  carriers  and other resellers 
the company distributes its products through wholesalers  resellers  national and regional retailers  value added resellers  and cataloguers  many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers 
the company also sells many of its products and resells third party products in most of its major markets directly to end users  certain education customers  and certain resellers through its online and retail stores 
iphone is distributed through the company  its cellular network carriers distribution channels  and certain third party resellers 
many resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions 
some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company s products 
such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products 
the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens  if resellers stopped distributing the company s products  or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products 
the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales  including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays 
these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue 
the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio 
although the company has not recognized any material losses on its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  future declines in their market values could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
given the global nature of its business  the company has investments both domestically and internationally 
additionally  the company s overall investment portfolio is often concentrated in the financial sector  which has been negatively impacted by the recent market liquidity conditions 
credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity  credit deterioration or losses  financial results  or other factors 
as a result  the value or liquidity of the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments could decline and result in a material impairment  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 

table of contents the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to long term supply agreements 
this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 
a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance 
the company also has unsecured non trade receivables resulting from the sale by the company of components to vendors who manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company 
in addition  the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of nand flash memory 
while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments  there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health  safety and environmental protection 
the company s products and services  and the production and distribution of those goods and services  are subject to a variety of laws and regulations 
these may require the company to offer customers the ability to return a product at the end of its useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the company 
such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the company operates  including various countries within europe and asia  certain canadian provinces and certain states within the us although the company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws  there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
changes in the company s tax rates could affect its future results 
the company s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 
the company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company is subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of insurance 
for certain risks  the company does not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and or availability 
because the company retains some portion of its insurable risks  and in some cases self insures completely  unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties the company s headquarters are located in cupertino  california 
the company has a manufacturing facility in cork  ireland 
as of september   the company leased approximately million square feet of space  primarily in the us  and to a lesser extent  in europe  japan  canada  and the asia pacific region 
the major facility leases are generally for terms of to years and generally provide renewal options for terms of to additional years 
leased space includes approximately million square feet of retail space  a majority of which is in the us lease terms for retail space range from to years  the majority of which are for years  and often contain multi year renewal options

the company also owned  square feet of facilities in 
table of contents sacramento  california that include warehousing and distribution operations  as well as a customer support call center 
in addition  the company owned approximately million square feet of facilities for research and development and corporate functions in cupertino  california  including approximately million square feet purchased in and for the future development of the company s second corporate campus in cupertino  california  and approximately  square feet for a data center in newark  california 
outside the us  the company owned additional facilities totaling approximately  square feet as of september  the company believes its existing facilities and equipment are well maintained and in good operating condition 
the company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships with outside manufacturing vendors  and therefore believes it has adequate manufacturing capacity for the foreseeable future 
the company continues to make investments in capital equipment as needed to meet anticipated demand for its products 
item legal proceedings as of september   the end of the annual period covered by this report  the company is subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below  as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results 
however  the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period  the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
the company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the company s results of operations

management believes the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments  warranty costs  stock based compensation  income taxes  and legal and other contingencies 
management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters 
the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware  software  music products  digital content  peripherals  and service and support contracts 
the company recognizes revenue for software products operating system software and applications software  or any product that is considered to be software related  in accordance with the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  eg  mac computers  ipod portable digital music players and iphone pursuant to american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
for products that are not software or software related  eg  digital content sold on the itunes store and certain mac  ipod and iphone supplies and accessories  the company recognizes revenue pursuant to the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for most of the company s product sales  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped 
for online sales to individuals  for some sales to education customers in the us  and for certain other sales  the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit 
if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not  or is presumed not to be  fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
for both apple tv and iphone  the company has indicated that from time to time it may provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers 
therefore  sales of apple tv and iphone handsets are recognized under subscription accounting in accordance with sop no 
the company recognizes the associated revenue and cost of goods sold on a straight line basis over the currently estimated month economic lives of these products  with any loss recognized at the time of sale 
costs incurred by the company for engineering  sales  marketing  and warranty are expensed as incurred 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs  including reseller and end user rebates  and other sales programs and volume based incentives 
for transactions involving price protection  the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded  provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
the company s policy requires that  if refunds cannot be reliably estimated  revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses 
for customer incentive programs  the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at 
table of contents which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered 
the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience 
future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered 
additionally  certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs 
if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives  the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue  which would have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company distributes its products through third party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education  consumer  and enterprise customers 
the company generally does not require collateral from its customers  however  the company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk 
in addition  when possible the company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in latin america  europe  asia  and australia and by arranging with third party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the company s direct customers 
these credit financing arrangements are directly between the third party financing company and the end customer 
as such  the company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements 
however  considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral  third party flooring arrangements  or credit insurance are outstanding with the company s distribution and retail channel partners 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers 
the company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible 
the company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors  including historical experience with bad debts  the general economic environment  the financial condition of the company s distribution channels  and the aging of such receivables 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s financial condition  if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer  or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated  the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts  which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments 
the company records a write down for inventories of components and products  including third party products held for resale  which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  product life cycle status  product development plans  current sales levels  and component cost trends 
the personal computer  consumer electronics and mobile communications industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes 
if future demand or market conditions for the company s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory  the company may be required to record additional write downs  which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write downs were recorded 
the company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
these commitments typically cover the company s requirements for periods ranging from to days 
if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products  the company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 

table of contents warranty costs the company provides for the estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates  historical and projected cost per claim  and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company s typical experience 
each quarter  the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
for products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to sop no 
 the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred 
if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the company s results of operations 
the company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software s compliance with specifications 
the estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized 
factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered  the number of updates expected to occur  and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the bsm option pricing model requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
significant changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of stock based awards granted in the future 
income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
effective at the beginning of  the company adopted financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
further information may be found in note  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of fin and other complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
legal and other contingencies as discussed in part i  item of this form k under the heading legal proceedings and in note commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is subject to 
table of contents various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  the company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
in management s opinion  the company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results 
however  the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty 
should the company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period  the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected

the company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during and  and anticipates gross margin levels of about in this expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions  flat or reduced pricing on new and innovative products that have higher cost structures  both expected and potential future cost increases for key components  a stronger us dollar  and higher logistical costs 
the foregoing statements regarding the company s expected gross margin percentage are forward looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors  including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in part i  item a  risk factors under the subheading future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain key components including  but not limited to microprocessors  nand flash memory  dram and lcds at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities  which is incorporated herein by reference 
there can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved 
in general  gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors  including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures  increased competition  compressed product life cycles  product transitions and expected increases in the cost of key components including  but not limited to microprocessors  nand flash memory  dynamic random access memory dram and liquid crystal displays lcds  as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments  or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to the company 
the following table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september  and excludes amounts already recorded on the company s balance sheet as current liabilities in millions total payments due in less than year payments due in years payments due in years payments due in more than years operating leases purchase obligations asset retirement obligations other obligations total lease commitments as of september   the company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of billion  billion of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities 
the company s major facility leases are generally for terms of to years and generally provide renewal options for terms of to additional years 
leases for retail space are for terms of to years  the majority of which are for years  and often contain multi year renewal options 
purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers the company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub assemblies for the company s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products 
these contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company  which typically covers periods ranging from to days 
the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
such purchase commitments typically cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from to days 
in addition  the company has an off balance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to sop no 
whereby the company recognizes warranty expense as incurred 
as of september   the company had outstanding off balance sheet third party manufacturing commitments  component purchase commitments  and estimated warranty commitments of billion 
during  the company entered into long term supply agreements with hynix semiconductor  inc  intel corporation  micron technology  inc  samsung electronics co  ltd  and toshiba corporation to secure supply of nand flash memory through calendar year as part of these agreements  the company prepaid billion for flash memory components during  which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement 
the company utilized million of the prepayment as of september  asset retirement obligations the company s asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination 
as of september   the company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of million would be required to fulfill these obligations 

table of contents other obligations other outstanding obligations were million as of september   which related to advertising  research and development  internet and telecommunications services  and other obligations 
during the first quarter of  the company adopted the provisions of fin the company had historically classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities  but beginning with the adoption of fin the company has reclassified gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non current liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet 
as of september   the company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of million and gross interest and penalties of million  both of which are classified as non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
at this time  the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes  therefore  such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 
indemnifications the company generally does not indemnify end users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights 
other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third party 
however  the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third party and  in the opinion of management  does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results 
therefore  the company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either september  or september  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions  both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures 
however  given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures  there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
interest rate risk while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  the company s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
as such  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  the value of those investments  as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges 
the company s short term investment policy and strategy attempts primarily to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements 
a portion of the company s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the company s investment policy and to an objective market benchmark 
the company s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance  allowing for differences in liquidity needs 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s investment policy requires investments to be rated single a or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 
all highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash 
table of contents equivalents  while highly liquid investments with initial maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short term investments 
as of september  and september   approximately billion and billion  respectively  of the company s short term investments had underlying maturities ranging from one to five years 
the remainder all had underlying maturities of less than months 
the company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes  in anticipation of credit deterioration  or for duration management 
the company recognized no material net gains or losses during  and related to such sales 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio  the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on investment positions as of september   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of september   a similar basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 
foreign currency risk in general  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  will negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities  certain firmly committed transactions  forecasted future cash flows  and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
generally  the company s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures  typically for three to six months 
however  the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality  prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures  and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions  the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates 
the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate  random market price paths 
the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value  for a given confidence interval  to the company s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model assumes normal market conditions 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments  and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 
based on the results of the model  the company estimates with confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september  compared to a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september  because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes  losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
actual future gains and losses associated with the company s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates  foreign currency exchanges rates  and the company s actual exposures and positions
