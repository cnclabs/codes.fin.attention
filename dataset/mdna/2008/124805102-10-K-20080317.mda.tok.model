capital expenditures during the years ended december   and primarily consisted of investments in technology  leasehold improvements  and purchases of furniture and equipment 
investing uses of cash during the year ended december  consisted of million of net cash used towards business acquisitions  million for the acquisition of intangible assets and million for net capital expenditures 
these investing uses of cash were partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of divested and discontinued operations  million in proceeds from the sale of an investment and million in net collections on notes receivable 
investing uses of cash during the year ended december  primarily consisted of million of net cash used towards business acquisitions  million for the acquisition of other intangible assets and million for net capital expenditures

investing uses of cash during the year ended december  primarily consisted of million of net cash used toward business acquisitions and million for net capital expenditures  and were partially offset by million in proceeds received from the sale of divested and discontinued operations and million in net collections on notes receivable 
cash flows from investing activities also include investing activities of discontinued operations  which primarily relate to capital expenditures 
investing cash flows used in discontinued operations were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
financing activities cbiz s financing cash flows typically consist of net borrowing and payment activity from the credit facility  activity related to our convertible notes  repurchases of cbiz common stock and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
financing uses of cash during the year ended december  included million in cash used to repurchase approximately million shares of cbiz common stock  and million in net payments towards notes payable and capitalized leases 
these uses of cash were substantially offset by sources of cash which included million in net proceeds from the credit facility and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options including tax benefits 
financing uses of cash during the year ended december  included million in net payments toward the credit facility  million in cash used to repurchase million shares of cbiz common stock  million in cash paid for debt issuance costs primarily related to the convertible senior subordinated notes  and million in net payments towards notes payable and capitalized leases

obligations and commitments cbiz s aggregate amount of future obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below in thousands total thereafter convertible notes interest on convertible notes credit facility notes payable capitalized leases restructuring lease obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations letters of credit in lieu of cash security deposits performance guarantees for non consolidated affiliates license bonds and other letters of credit total excludes cash expected to be received under subleases 
the above table does not reflect million of unrecognized tax benefits  which the company has accrued for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin  since we are unable to determine a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the future payments 
off balance sheet arrangements cbiz maintains administrative service agreements with independent cpa firms as described more fully under business services financial services  which qualify as variable interest entities under fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as amended 
the impact to cbiz of this accounting pronouncement is not material to the financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows of cbiz  and is further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herewith 
cbiz provides guarantees of performance obligations for a cpa firm with which cbiz maintains an administrative service agreement 
potential obligations under the guarantees totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  as amended  cbiz has recognized a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing these guarantees 
the liability is recorded as other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
cbiz does not expect it will be required to make payments under these guarantees 
cbiz provides letters of credit to landlords lessors of its leased premises in lieu of cash security deposits 
letters of credit totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  cbiz provides license bonds to various state agencies to meet certain licensing requirements 
the amount of license bonds outstanding at december  and was million and million  respectively 
cbiz has various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations  warranties  covenants or agreements  related to matters such as title to assets sold and certain tax matters 
payment by cbiz under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned upon the other party making a claim 
such claims are typically subject to challenge by cbiz and to dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract 
further  cbiz s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount and  in some instances  cbiz may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by cbiz 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of cbiz s obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
historically  cbiz has not made any payments under these agreements that have been material individually or in the aggregate 
as of december   cbiz was not aware of any obligations arising under indemnification agreements that would require material payments 
interest rate risk management cbiz has used interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of its credit facility and related overall cost of borrowing 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments to effectively convert floating rate debt into fixed rate debt based on a one  three  or six month us dollar libor 
interest rate swaps allow cbiz to maintain a target range of fixed to floating rate debt 
during the years ended december  and  management did not utilize interest rate swaps 
in december  cbiz entered into an arrangement effective in january to swap million of its floating rate debt into fixed rate debt for two years to mitigate our interest rate risk 
this swap agreement had no impact on the financial statements for the year ended december  management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as it deems appropriate under certain operating and market conditions 
during  cbiz sold million in convertible senior subordinated notes notes bearing a fixed interest rate of to qualified institutional buyers 
as the notes mature on june  and have call protection until june   we believe this low cost of borrowing mitigates our interest rate risk 
in connection with payroll services provided to clients  cbiz collects funds from its clients accounts in advance of paying these client obligations 
these funds held for clients are segregated and invested in short term investments  including auction rate securities ars  which have historically been highly liquid 
in accordance with our investment policy  all investments carry an investment grade rating at the time of initial investment 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for further discussion of ars 
the interest income on these short term investments mitigates the interest rate risk for the borrowing costs of cbiz s credit facility  as the rates on both the investments and the outstanding borrowings against the credit facility float based on market conditions 
critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to the understanding of cbiz s consolidated financial statements because their application places significant demand on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that estimates may require adjustment if future events develop differently than expected 
revenue recognition and valuation of unbilled revenues revenue is recognized only when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our fee to the client is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are in accordance with gaap and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
revenue recognition sab 
contract terms are typically contained in a signed agreement with our clients or when applicable  other third parties which generally define the scope of services to be provided  pricing of services  and payment terms generally ranging from invoice date to days after invoice date 
billing may occur prior to  during  or upon completion of the service 
we typically do not have acceptance provisions or right of refund arrangements included in these agreements 
contract terms vary depending on the scope of service provided  deliverables  and complexity of the engagement 
certain of our client arrangements encompass multiple deliverables 
cbiz accounts for these arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
if the deliverables meet the criteria in eitf  the deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting and revenue is allocated to the deliverables based on their relative fair values 
revenue for each unit is recognized separately in accordance with cbiz s revenue recognition policy for each unit 
for those arrangements where the deliverables do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  revenue from all deliverables are treated as one accounting unit and evaluated for appropriate accounting treatment based upon the underlying facts and circumstances 
cbiz offers a vast array of products and business services to its clients 
those services are delivered through four practice groups 
a description of revenue recognition  as it relates to those groups  is provided below 
financial services revenue primarily consists of fees for services rendered to our clients for accounting services  preparation of tax returns  consulting services  compliance projects  services pursuant to administrative service agreements described under variable interest entities  and valuation services including fairness opinions  business plans  litigation support  purchase price allocations and derivative valuations 
clients are billed for these services based upon either a time and expense model  a predetermined agreed upon fixed fee  or as a percentage of savings 
revenue recognition as it pertains to each of these arrangements is as follows time and expense arrangements revenue is recognized based upon actual hours incurred on client projects at expected net realizable rates per hour  plus agreed upon out of pocket expenses 
the cumulative impact on any subsequent revision in the estimated realizable value of unbilled fees for a particular client project is reflected in the period in which the change becomes known 
fixed fee arrangements revenue for fixed fee arrangements is recognized over the performance period based upon progress towards completion  which is determined based upon actual hours incurred on the client project compared to estimated total hours to complete the client project 
contingent revenue arrangements revenue is recognized when savings to the client is determined and collection is reasonably assured 
administrative service agreement revenue revenue for administrative service fees is recognized as services are provided  based upon actual hours incurred 
employee services revenue consists primarily of brokerage and agency commissions  fee income for administering health and retirement plans and payroll service fees 
revenue also includes investment income related to client payroll funds that are held in cbiz accounts  as is industry practice 
a description of the revenue recognition  based on the service provided  insurance product sold  and billing arrangement  is provided below 
commissions revenue commissions relating to brokerage and agency activities whereby cbiz has primary responsibility for the collection of premiums from insured s agency or indirect billing are recognized as of the latter of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date billed to the customer  commissions to be received directly from insurance companies direct billing are recognized when the data necessary from the carriers to properly record revenue becomes available  and life insurance commissions are recognized when the policy becomes effective 
commission revenue is reported net of sub broker commissions  and reserves for estimated policy cancellations and terminations 
the cancellation and termination reserve is based upon estimates and assumptions using historical cancellation and termination experience and other current factors to project future experience 
cbiz periodically reviews the adequacy of the reserve and makes adjustments as necessary 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
commissions which are based upon certain performance targets are recognized at the earlier of written notification that the target has been achieved  or cash collection 
fee income fee income is recognized in the period in which services are provided  and may be based on predetermined agreed upon fixed fees  actual hours incurred on an hourly fee basis  or asset based fees 
revenue for fixed fee arrangements is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period  as these services are provided to clients continuously throughout the term of the arrangement 
revenue which is based upon actual hours incurred is recognized as services are performed 
revenue for asset based fees is recognized when the data necessary to compute revenue is determinable  which is typically when either  market valuation information is available  the data necessary to compute our fees is made available by third party administrators or when cash is received 
cbiz only recognizes revenue when cash is received for those arrangements where the data necessary to compute our fees is not available to the company in a timely manner 
payroll revenue related to payroll processing fees is recognized when the actual payroll processing occurs 
revenue related to investment income earned on payroll funds is based upon actual amounts earned on those funds and is recognized in the period that the income is earned 
medical management professionals revenue is primarily related to fees charged to clients for billing  collection and full practice management services  which are charged to clients based upon a percentage of net collections on our clients patient accounts or a fee per transaction processed 
revenue also relates to fees charged to clients for statement mailing services 
the revenue recognition as it pertains to each of these arrangements is as follows fee income for those arrangements where fees to clients are determined based upon a percentage of net collections  revenue is determinable  earned and recognized when payments are received by our clients on their patient accounts 
for those arrangements where clients are charged a fee for each transaction processed  revenue is recognized proportionately over a predetermined service period 
statement mailing services revenues for statement mailing services are recognized when statements are processed and mailed 
national practices the business units that comprise this practice group offer a variety of services 
a description of revenue recognition associated with the primary services is provided below 
technology consulting revenue consists of consulting services and sales of hardware  software and service agreement contracts 
consulting services consulting services primarily relate to the maintenance and repair of hardware 
these services are charged to customers based upon time and material  cost plus an agreed upon markup percentage  or a predetermined agreed upon fixed fee 
revenue related to consulting services is recognized as services are performed or upon acceptance by the client  depending on the client contract terms 
service agreement contracts revenue associated with service agreement contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the agreement 
hardware revenue associated with hardware sales is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of the product 
software  post contract support and installation services cbiz is a re seller of software and post contract support pcs that is provided by software vendors 
cbiz also provides installation and implementation services that do not involve significant production or modification of software 
revenue related to software  pcs and installation services is recognized in accordance with sop cbiz sells installation and implementation services and pcs on a stand alone basis 
software is typically sold with installation and implementation services 
revenue is allocated to each element based upon vendor specific objective evidence of fair value which is commensurate with prices charged to the customers for these items 
revenue related to the sale of software and pcs is recognized upon delivery  and installation and implementation service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
health care consulting clients are billed for health care consulting services based upon a predetermined agreed upon fixed fee  time and expense  or as a percentage of savings 
revenue for fixed fee and time and expense arrangements is recognized over the performance period based upon actual hours incurred  and revenue that is contingent upon savings is recognized after contingencies have been resolved and verified by a third party 
mergers acquisitions and capital advisory clients are billed monthly for non refundable retainer fees  or upon the completion of a transaction success fees 
revenue associated with non refundable retainer fees is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the engagement  as services are performed throughout the term of the contract period of the arrangement 
revenue associated with success fee transactions is recognized when the transaction is completed 
valuation of accounts receivable and notes receivable the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  management must make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivable  including unbilled accounts receivable related to current period service revenue 
management analyzes historical bad debts  client credit worthiness  the age of accounts receivable and current economic trends and conditions when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the collectibility of notes receivable 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of goodwill cbiz utilizes the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations 
intangible assets  which include client lists and non compete agreements  are amortized by the straight line method over their expected period of benefit  not to exceed ten years 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year  and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
there was no goodwill impairment during the years ended december   or loss contingencies loss contingencies  including litigation claims  are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis that often depends on judgment about potential actions by third parties 
incentive compensation determining the amount of expense to recognize for incentive compensation at interim and annual reporting dates involves management judgment 
expenses accrued for incentive compensation are based upon expected financial results for the year  and the ultimate determination of incentive compensation can not be made until after year end results are finalized 
thus  amounts accrued are subject to change in future interim periods if actual future financial results are higher or lower than expected 
in arriving at the amount of expense to recognize  management believes it makes reasonable judgments using all significant information available 
income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves management judgment 
management estimates an annual effective tax rate which takes into consideration expected full year results  which is applied to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense 
in the event there is a significant  unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
in addition  we establish reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
cbiz adopted the provisions of fin on january  see note  summary of significant accounting policies and note  income taxes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of effective income tax rates to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as we prepare our corporate income tax returns  the level of actual pre tax income  revisions to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  the receipt and expected utilization of federal and state income tax credits  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
management believes it makes reasonable judgments using all significant information available when estimating income taxes 
other significant policies other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to understanding the consolidated financial statements 
those policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cbiz s floating rate debt under its credit facility exposes the company to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are different 
a change in the federal funds rate  or the reference rate set by the bank of america  would affect the rate at which cbiz could borrow funds under its credit facility 
cbiz s balance outstanding under its credit facility at december  was million 
if market rates were to increase or decrease basis points from the levels at december   interest expense would increase or decrease approximately million annually 
cbiz does not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments 
cbiz has used interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of its credit facility and related overall cost of borrowing 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments to effectively convert floating rate debt into fixed rate debt based on a one  three  or six month us dollar libor 
interest rate swaps allow cbiz to maintain a target range of fixed to floating rate debt 
in december  cbiz entered into an arrangement effective in january to swap million of its floating rate debt into fixed rate debt for two years to mitigate the company s interest rate risk 
management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as it deems appropriate under certain operating and market conditions 
in connection with cbiz s payroll business  funds held for clients are segregated and invested in short term investments  including ars 
ars are variable debt instruments with longer stated maturities whose interest rates are reset at pre determined short term intervals through a dutch auction system 
cbiz invests a portion of funds held for clients in ars as they typically generate higher rates of return than money market investment alternatives 
in accordance with our investment policy  all investments carry an investment grade rating at the time of the initial investment 
as of february   cbiz held million in ars investments 
the credit markets are currently experiencing uncertainty which has impacted the ars markets primarily due to failed auctions as a result of sell orders exceeding buy orders 
as of december   cbiz had not experienced any failed auctions with respect to ars held in its portfolio 
however  as a result of the market conditions since december   cbiz has experienced failed auctions with ars investments during the first quarter of  and one of these investments was downgraded below the minimum rating required of the company s investment policy 
the remainder of the investments continue to carry an investment grade rating 
although we have experienced some failed auctions with regards to ars  cbiz believes it has adequate liquidity to operate and settle client obligations as the majority of cbiz s client funds are invested in highly liquid short term money market funds
