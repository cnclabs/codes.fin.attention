the many changes to reimbursement  which were finalized in the fourth quarter of  added complexity and uncertainty to the claims process and have eroded our customers ability to provide quality solutions

as a result of the reduced profitability of its na hme operating segment  and uncertainty associated with future market conditions  the company recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill and intangible assets of this segment of  in the impairment of goodwill in the na hme operating segment was primarily the result of reduced government reimbursement levels and changes in reimbursement policies  which negatively affected revenues and profitability in the na hme operating segment 
during  changes announced by the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  affected eligibility  documentation  codes  and payment rules relating to power wheelchairs 
these changes impacted the predictability of reimbursement of expenses for and access to power wheelchairs  created uncertainty in the market place  and thus had a negative impact on na hme s revenues and related earnings 
effective november   cms reduced the maximum reimbursement amount for power wheelchairs under medicare by up to 
the reduced reimbursement levels have caused and continue to cause consumers to choose less expensive versions of the company s power wheelchairs 
na hme sales of respiratory products were also negatively affected by the changes in small and independent provider sales declined as these dealers slowed their purchases of the company s homefill oxygen system product line  in part  until they had a clearer view of future oxygen reimbursement levels 
furthermore  a study issued by the office of inspector general or oig  in september suggested that billion in savings could be achieved over five years by reducing the reimbursed rental period from three years the reimbursement period under current law to months 
the uncertainty created by these announcements continues to negatively impact the home oxygen equipment market  particularly for those providers considering changing to the homefill oxygen system 
medicare will also institute a new competitive bidding program for various items in ten of the largest metropolitan areas to be effective in this program is designed to reduce medicare payment levels for items that the medicare program spends the most money on under the home medical equipment benefit 
this new program will likely eliminate some providers from the competitive bidding markets  because only those providers who are chosen to participate based largely on price will be able to provide beneficiaries with items included in the bid

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included in the report include accounts of the company  all majority owned subsidiaries and a variable interest entity for which the company is the primary beneficiary 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates

for example  the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience  that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate 
estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss award settlements on claims

 fair value measurements  which creates a framework for measuring fair value  clarifies the definition of fair value and expands the disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
statement no 
does not require any new fair value measurements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   thus january  the company adopted the new standard as of the effective date and currently does not believe the adoption will have a material impact on the company s financial position or future results as the company is already performing its goodwill and intangible valuation calculations and estimating the fair value of the company s financial instruments using methodology which is principally consistent with statement no 
on september   the fasb exposed for comment fasb staff position apb a fsp apb a to provide clarification of the accounting for convertible debt that can be settled in cash upon conversion 
the fasb believes this clarification is needed because the current accounting being applied for convertible debt does not fully reflect the true economic impact on the issuer since the conversion option is not captured as a borrowing cost and its full dilutive effect is not included in earnings per share 
the proposed fsp would require separate accounting for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt in a manner that would reflect invacare s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
the company would be required to bifurcate a component of its convertible debt as a component of stockholders equity and accrete the resulting debt discount as interest expense 
the comment period regarding the exposure draft ended october  and the exposure draft is currently being redeliberated by the fasb 
should the proposed fsp become effective as drafted  the change could materially impact the company s interest expense and earnings per share 
the most recent proposed effective date was january  with retrospective application required for all periods presented and no grandfathering for existing instruments

sfas r also requires expanded disclosure regarding the nature and financial effects of a business combination 
sfas r is effective for the company beginning january  and the company is currently evaluating the future impacts and disclosures of this standard
