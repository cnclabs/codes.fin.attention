item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements of kennametal inc and the related footnotes 
unless otherwise specified  any reference to a year is to a fiscal year ended june additionally  when used in this annual report on form k  unless the context requires otherwise  the terms we  our and us refer to kennametal inc and its subsidiaries 
overview kennametal inc is a leading global supplier of tooling  engineered components and advanced materials consumed in production processes 
we believe that our reputation for manufacturing excellence as well as our technological expertise and innovation in our principal products has enabled us to achieve a leading market presence in our primary markets 
we believe that we are the second largest global provider of metalcutting tools and tooling systems 
kennametal delivered record sales of billion and earnings per diluted share of in despite operating in a challenging environment 
rising raw material costs  higher transportation costs  record fuel prices and a soft economy in north america provided considerable headwinds for both kennametal and certain of our served end markets 
our strategies to further diversify our portfolio as well as the geographies and end markets we serve contributed to this success 
in  we took advantage of a slower growth sales environment to accelerate planned restructuring activities to reduce operating costs and enhance efficiencies 
all of this has and will provide kennametal with additional flexibility to further capitalize on business opportunities and market strengths around the world while enabling us to weather more demanding business conditions that transpire in certain geographic regions and market sectors 
we continued to diversify our geographic footprint with the long term goal to establish an evenly balanced presence across all three of our regions  north america  western europe and rest of world markets 
in  our sales by geographic region were as follows percent from north america  percent from western europe and percent from rest of world markets 
this strategy proved its merit when growth in global markets helped to offset softer conditions in north america 
we also increased the balance between mssg and amsg  moving closer toward our long range goal of having each business segment represent approximately half of total sales 
in  mssg and amsg comprised percent and percent of sales  respectively 
additionally  we achieved a greater balance in our served end markets  bolstered particularly in aerospace and defense  durable goods  machine tools  underground coal mining and general engineering sectors 
in  we continued to manage our portfolio to maximize earnings growth and shareowner returns 
in our mssg segment  we divested two non core businesses and completed two small acquisitions 
we remained disciplined in evaluating acquisition opportunities and continued to invest in our business with capital expenditures of million for enhanced manufacturing capabilities and geographic expansion 
in addition  during we repurchased million shares of our capital stock for a total cost of million 
we also continued to implement our lean initiatives which drive higher performance and ongoing improvements throughout our global organization 
as one example of the benefits of these initiatives  we reduced operating expense as a percent of sales for the third consecutive year 
in addition  we invested further in technology and innovation to continue delivering a high level of new products to our customers 
research and development expenses totaled million for  an increase of million from in  we generated approximately percent of our sales from new products 
restructuring actions during  we announced our intent to implement restructuring actions to further our ability to achieve our long term goals for margin expansion and earnings growth as well as to reduce costs and improve efficiency in our operations 
consistent with this announcement  we initiated actions in related to facility rationalizations and employment reductions as well as the conversion of an international defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan 
we recorded restructuring and related charges of million in as follows cost of goods sold million  operating expense million and restructuring and asset impairment million 
mssg  amsg and corporate charges were million  million and million  respectively 
see note in our consolidated financial statements set forth in item these and other restructuring actions are expected to be completed over the next nine to fifteen months 
total related charges are expected to be in the range of million to million of which approximately percent are expected to be cash expenditures 
annual ongoing benefits from these actions  once fully implemented  are expected to be in the range of million to million 
acquisitions and divestitures during  we did not complete any material acquisitions or divestitures 
however  we made two small acquisitions in europe  within our mssg segment  for a combined net purchase price of million 
also during  we divested two small  non core businesses from our mssg segment  one in the us and one in europe 
combined cash proceeds received were million and we recognized a combined loss on divestiture of million

this divestiture resulted in a pre tax loss of million in included in the loss was a million inventory charge reported in cost of goods sold 
this business was a part of the mssg segment 
cash flows of this component that were retained were deemed significant in relation to prior cash flows of the disposed component 
the sale agreement included a three year supply agreement that management deemed to be both quantitatively and qualitatively material to the overall operations of the disposed component and constituted significant continuing involvement 
as such  the results of operations of presto prior to the divestiture were reported in continuing operations 
effective june   we divested j l for proceeds of million  of which million and million was received in and  respectively  as a part of our strategy to exit non core businesses

we also continue to evaluate opportunities for the introduction of new and or complimentary product offerings into new and or existing market areas  where appropriate 
in  we expect to evaluate potential acquisition candidates that offer strategic technologies in an effort to continue to grow our amsg business and further enhance our mssg market position 
discontinued operations during  our board of directors and management approved plans to divest our kemmer praezision electronics business electronics and our consumer retail product line  including industrial saw blades cpg as a part of our strategy to exit non core businesses 
these divestitures were accounted for as discontinued operations 
the divestiture of electronics  which was part of the amsg segment  was completed in two separate transactions 
the first transaction closed during the second transaction closed during during  we recognized a pre tax loss of million  including an million inventory related charge 
during  we recognized a pre tax gain on divestiture of million to adjust the related net assets to fair value 
also during  management completed its assessment of the future use of a building owned and previously used by electronics  but not divested

the following represents the results of discontinued operations for the years ended june in thousands sales loss from discontinued operations before income taxes income tax benefit expense loss from discontinued operations 
table of contents results of continuing operations sales sales of  million in increased percent versus  million in the increase in sales was primarily attributed to organic sales growth of million  the impact of acquisitions of million and favorable foreign currency effects of million 
regionally  organic sales growth was mostly driven by growth in european and asia pacific markets offset somewhat by weakness in the north american market 
organic sales growth by sector was led by year over year expansion in the aerospace  machine tools  general engineering  mining and highway construction markets 
sales of  million in increased percent versus  million in the increase in sales was primarily attributed to organic sales growth of million and favorable foreign currency effects of million 
the organic sales growth was mostly driven by growth in european and developing economies  growth in the distribution and general engineering markets and favorable conditions in certain other markets  particularly in the energy and mining markets 
these increases in sales were partially offset by a reduction from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of million  primarily the divestiture of j l 
gross profit gross profit increased million to million in from million in the percent increase was primarily due to organic sales growth  the effect of acquisitions  the effects of price increases and the impact of favorable foreign currency effects of million 
these benefits were partially offset by higher raw material costs  particularly products containing steel and cobalt  as well as a less favorable sales mix primarily due to a lower proportion of sales of energy related products and lower performance in our surface finishing machines and services business 
gross profit for included restructuring charges of million related to inventory write offs and million of other restructuring related charges 
the gross profit margin for decreased basis points to percent from percent in the decrease was primarily due to higher raw material costs as well as a less favorable sales mix and lower performance in our surface finishing machines and services business 
gross profit increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to organic sales growth  favorable foreign currency effects of million and a reduction of pension and other postretirement benefit expense of million

the gross profit margin for decreased basis points to percent from percent in the decrease was primarily attributed to higher raw material costs and an unfavorable impact due to the above mentioned plant closure costs partially offset by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and a reduction in pension expense  which favorably impacted the margin by basis points and basis points  respectively 
operating expense operating expense in was million  an increase of million  or percent  compared to million in the increase in operating expense was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects of million  the impact of acquisitions of million  a million increase in employment costs and a million increase in professional fees  partially offset by a decrease in other expenses

see the discussion under the heading restructuring actions within this md a for additional information 
the operating performance of our surface finishing machines and services business was lower than expected in the earnings forecast for the next five years was revised as a result of this decline in operating performance and a further weakness in markets served by this business  specifically in north america and the automotive sector 
as a result  the tangible and intangible assets of this business were tested for impairment during and we recorded a related million amsg goodwill impairment charge 
as of june   the remaining carrying value of goodwill related to this business was million 
the fair value of this business was estimated using a combination of a present value technique and a valuation technique based on multiples of earnings and revenue 

table of contents during  we completed our strategic analysis and plan for our widia brand 
as a key element of our channel and brand strategy  we decided to leverage the strength of this brand to accelerate growth in the distribution market 
since demand in the distribution market is mostly for standard products and to further our relationship with our widia distributors  we furthermore decided to migrate direct sales of widia custom solutions products to the kennametal brand 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million related to our mssg widia trademark during in  we did not incur any restructuring or impairment charges with respect to our continuing operations

amortization expense increased million to million in from million in the increase was due to the impact of acquisitions 
interest expense interest expense increased million to million in  compared with million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in average domestic borrowings of million  offset in part by the effect of lower average interest rates on domestic borrowings of percent  compared to percent in the portion of our debt subject to variable rates of interest was approximately percent and percent at june  and  respectively 
interest expense decreased million to million in compared with million in this decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in average domestic borrowings partially offset by the impact of higher average borrowing rates 
the weighted average domestic borrowing rate increased from percent in to percent in due primarily to repayments of lower cost floating rate debt during other income  net in  other income  net decreased by million to million compared to million in the decrease was due to unfavorable foreign currency transaction results of million  lower other income of million and lower interest income of million 
in  other income  net increased by million to million compared to million in the increase was primarily due to a reduction in accounts receivable securitization fees of million  an information technology service agreement resulting in million of income and an increase in interest income of million  partially offset by the effect of a prior year gain on the sale of a non core product line of million 
income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations for was percent compared to percent for the decrease in the effective rate from to was primarily driven by a further increase in earnings under our pan european business strategy  the combined effects of other international operations  and a tax benefit associated with a dividend reinvestment plan in china 
the effects of these items were partially offset by the effect of the goodwill impairment charge related to our surface finishing machines and services businesses for which there was no tax benefit  and a non cash income tax charge related to a german tax reform bill that was enacted in the first quarter of during  we made a change in our determination with respect to cumulative undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries and affiliates whereby we now consider unremitted previously taxed income of our international subsidiaries to not be permanently reinvested 
as a result of this change  we accrued an income tax liability of million 
of this amount  million decreased accumulated other comprehensive income and million increased tax expense 
as of june   the unremitted earnings of our non us subsidiaries and affiliates that have not been previously taxed in the us are determined to be permanently reinvested  and accordingly  no deferred tax liability has been recorded in connection therewith 
it is not practical to estimate the income tax effect that might be incurred if earnings not previously taxed in the us were remitted to the united states

the impact of these items was partially offset by a tax charge recognized in for tax contingencies in europe  as well as the favorable resolution of tax contingencies in that were primarily related to a research and development credit claim

liquidity and capital resources our cash flow from operations is the primary source of financing for capital expenditures and organic growth 
the most significant risk associated with our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations is the overall level of demand for our products 
however  we believe we can adequately control costs and manage our working capital to meet our cash flow needs throughout changes in the economic cycle 
in march  we entered into a five year  multi currency  revolving credit facility with a group of financial institutions credit agreement 
the credit agreement permits revolving credit loans of up to million for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement allows for borrowings in us dollars  euro  canadian dollars  pound sterling and japanese yen 
interest payable under the credit agreement is based upon the type of borrowing under the facility and may be libor plus an applicable margin  the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus percent or fixed as negotiated by us 

table of contents the credit agreement requires us to comply with various restrictive and affirmative covenants  including two financial covenants a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio as those terms are defined in the agreement 
as of june   we had no outstanding borrowings under the agreement 
we had the ability to borrow under the agreement  or otherwise incur additional debt of up to billion as of june  and remain in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant 
at june   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
borrowings under the credit agreement are guaranteed by our significant domestic subsidiaries 
additionally  we obtain local financing through credit lines with commercial banks in the various countries in which we operate 
at june   these borrowings amounted to million of notes payable and million of term debt and capital leases 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the availability under our credit lines will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements over the next months 
based upon our debt structure at june  and  approximately percent and percent of our debt  respectively  was exposed to variable rates of interest  which is consistent with our target range for variable versus fixed interest rate debt 
we periodically review the target range and the strategies designed to maintain the mix of variable to fixed interest rate debt within that range 
in the future  we may decide to adjust the target range or the strategies to achieve it 
following is a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of june  in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt notes payable pension benefit payments postretirement benefit payments capital leases operating leases purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total long term debt includes interest obligations of million

these amounts include interest of million accrued related to such positions as of june  the amount included for is expected to be paid within the next twelve months 
the remaining amount of unrecognized tax benefits is included in the thereafter column as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments

table of contents discussion of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
as part of our financial reporting process  our management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base our judgments and develops estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we use historical experience and available information to make these judgments and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products and assembled machines 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that the delivery of our products and assembled machines is fob shipping point and that title and all risks of loss and damages pass to the buyer upon delivery of the sold products or assembled machines to the common carrier 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that acceptance of the conditions of shipment is considered to have occurred unless written notice of objection is received by kennametal within calendar days of the date specified on the invoice 
we do not ship products or assembled machines unless we have documentation authorizing shipment to our customers 
our products are consumed by our customers in the manufacture of their products 
historically  we have experienced very low levels of returned products and assembled machines and do not consider the effect of returned products and assembled machines to be material 
we have recorded an estimated returned goods allowance to provide for any potential returns 
we warrant that products and services sold are free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service when correctly installed  used and maintained 
this warranty terminates days after delivery of the product to the customer  and does not apply to products that have been subjected to misuse  abuse  neglect or improper storage  handling or maintenance 
products may be returned to kennametal only after inspection and approval by kennametal and upon receipt by the customer of shipping instructions from kennametal 
we have included an estimated allowance for warranty returns in our returned goods allowance discussed above 
we recognize revenue related to the sale of specialized assembled machines upon customer acceptance and installation  as installation is deemed essential to the functionality of a specialized assembled machine 
sales of specialized assembled machines were immaterial for  and stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for all stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service substantive vesting period 
we continue to follow the nominal vesting period approach for unvested awards granted prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment revised on july  we utilize the black scholes valuation method to establish the fair value of all awards 
accounting for contingencies we accrue for contingencies when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment in both assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating the amount of probable loss 
the significant contingencies affecting our financial statements include environmental  health and safety matters and litigation 
long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets that are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include technological advances  changes in our business model  capital structure  economic conditions or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon  among other things  our assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we will recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
we apply our best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine if a triggering event has occurred  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill of each of our reporting units by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
we apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of the financial projections used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected financial information 
this evaluation is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 

table of contents pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits we sponsor these types of benefit plans for a majority of our employees and retirees 
accounting for the cost of these plans requires the estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the expected work life of employees participating in these plans 
this estimation requires our judgment about the discount rate used to determine these obligations  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  rate of future health care costs  withdrawal and mortality rates and participant retirement age 
differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans 
in the valuation of our pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit liabilities  management utilizes various assumptions 
we determine our discount rate based on an investment grade bond yield curve with a duration that approximates the benefit payment timing of each plan 
this rate can fluctuate based on changes in investment grade bond yields 
at june   a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in our discount rates would increase or decrease  respectively  our pre tax income by approximately million 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is estimated based on an evaluation of historical returns for each asset category held by the plans  coupled with the current and short term mix of the investment portfolio 
the historical returns are adjusted for expected future market and economic changes 
this return will fluctuate based on actual market returns and other economic factors 
the rate of future health care cost increases is based on historical claims and enrollment information projected over the next fiscal year and adjusted for administrative charges 
this rate is expected to decrease until at june   a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in our health care cost trend rates would decrease or increase our pre tax income by million 
future compensation rates  withdrawal rates and participant retirement age are determined based on historical information 
these assumptions are not expected to significantly change 
mortality rates are determined based on a review of published mortality tables 
we expect to contribute million and million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans  respectively  in allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the creditworthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze additional factors such as our historical bad debt experience  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the last in  first out method for determining the cost of a significant portion of our us inventories 
the cost of the remainder of our inventories is determined under the first in  first out or average cost methods 
when market conditions indicate an excess of carrying costs over market value  a lower of cost or market provision is recorded 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves are established based upon our evaluation of the quantity of inventory on hand relative to demand 
income taxes realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income  the timing and amount of which are uncertain in part due to the expected profitability of certain foreign subsidiaries 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of june   the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards  accrued employee benefits and inventory reserves 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase in the valuation allowance would be required

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
as part of our financial risk management program  we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and therefore hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to dampen the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results and to achieve our targeted mix of fixed and floating interest rates on outstanding debt 
our objective in managing foreign exchange exposures with derivative instruments is to reduce volatility for both earnings and cash flow  allowing us to focus more of our attention on business operations 
with respect to interest rate management  these derivative instruments allow us to achieve our targeted fixed to floating interest rate mix as a separate decision from funding arrangements in the bank and public debt markets 
we measure hedge effectiveness by assessing the changes in the fair value or expected future cash flows of the hedged item 
the ineffective portions are recorded in other income  net in the current period 
see notes and in our consolidated financial statements set forth in item we are exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance of derivative contracts and  in the event of nonperformance  to market risk for changes in interest and currency rates  as well as settlement risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk through credit standards  diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the following provides additional information on our use of derivative instruments 
included below is a sensitivity analysis that is based upon a hypothetical percent weakening or strengthening in the us dollar compared to the june  foreign currency rates and the effective interest rates under our current borrowing arrangements 
we compared the contractual derivative and borrowing arrangements in effect at june  to the hypothetical foreign exchange or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on interest expense  pre tax income or accumulated other comprehensive income 
our analysis takes into consideration the different types of derivative instruments and the applicability of hedge accounting 

table of contents cash flow hedges currency a portion of our operations consists of investments in foreign subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates arises from these investments  intercompany loans utilized to finance these subsidiaries  trade receivables and payables and firm commitments arising from international transactions 
we manage our foreign exchange transaction risk to reduce the volatility of cash flows caused by currency fluctuations through natural offsets where appropriate and through foreign exchange contracts 
these contracts are designated as hedges of transactions that will settle in future periods and otherwise would expose us to foreign currency risk 
our foreign exchange hedging program minimizes our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
this exposure arises largely from anticipated cash flows from cross border intercompany sales of products and services 
this program utilizes range forwards and forward contracts primarily to sell foreign currency 
the notional amounts of the contracts translated into us dollars at june  and rates were million and million  respectively 
we would have paid million and million at june  and  respectively  to settle these contracts  which represent the fair value of these agreements 
at june   a hypothetical percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar would change accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  by million 
in addition  we may enter into forward contracts to hedge transaction exposures or significant cross border intercompany loans by either purchasing or selling specified amounts of foreign currency at a specified date 
at june  and  we had several outstanding forward contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency  with notional amounts  translated into us dollars at june  and rates  of million and million  respectively 
at june   a hypothetical percent change in the year end exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in pre tax income of million related to these positions 
interest rate our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk in order to balance our exposure between fixed and floating rates while attempting to minimize our borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to these borrowings 
we had no such agreements in place at june  at june   we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that effectively converted notional amounts million of debt from floating to fixed interest rates 
these agreements matured in we would have received million at june  to settle these interest rate swap agreements  which represented the fair value of these agreements 
fair value hedges interest rate as discussed above  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
at june  and  we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that effectively convert a notional amount of million of the senior unsecured notes from fixed to variable interest rates 
these agreements mature in june debt and notes payable at june  and  we had million and million  respectively  of debt  including capital leases and notes payable outstanding 
effective interest rates as of june  and were percent and percent  respectively  including the effect of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical change of percent in interest rates from june  levels would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have materially increased earnings in and and materially reduced earnings in as compared to the prior year periods 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a material impact on future earnings in the short term and long term
