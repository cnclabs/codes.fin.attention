the management s discussion and analysis md a  detailed below  is presented in five parts  critical accounting estimates  results of operations for versus and versus  recent accounting developments  liquidity and capital resources  business and financial outlook and risks and uncertainties 
this md a should be read in conjunction with the december  consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related revenues and expenses  and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions made require judgment on the part of management and are based on the company s historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances 
management continually evaluates the information that forms the basis of its estimates and assumptions as the business of the company and the business environment generally changes 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the company s financial statements 
the following are the accounting estimates which management believes to be most important to the business of the company 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time of delivery of the product or service and when all of the following have occurred a sales agreement is in place  price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
in the sunopta bioprocess segment  the percentage of completion method is used to account for significant contracts when related costs can be reasonably estimated 
the amounts of revenue and profit recognized each year are based on the ratio of hours incurred to the total expected hours 
costs incurred on long term contracts include labor  material  other direct costs and overheads 
losses  if any  on long term contracts are recognized during the period they are determined 
sunopta inc december  k accounts receivable the company s accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from its customers 
the carrying value of each account is carefully monitored with a view to assessing the likelihood of collection 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for as an estimate of losses that could result from customers defaulting on their obligation to the company 
in assessing the amount of reserve required  a number of factors are considered including the age of the account  the credit worthiness of the customer  payment terms  the customer s historical payment history and general economic conditions 
because the amount of the reserve is an estimate  the actual amount collected could differ from the carrying value of the amount receivable 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory inventory is the company s largest current asset 
the company s inventory consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods held for sale 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost  valued on a weighted average cost basis  or estimate net realizable value except certain grain inventories that are carried at market value 
depending on market conditions  the actual amount received on sale could differ from management s estimate of market 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the movements in the inventory reserve 
prepaid and other current assets prepaid and other current assets include amounts paid in cash and recorded as a current asset prior to consumption by the company 
the balance also includes advances to growers required to secure future delivery of product net of provisions 
an allowance against realizing these advances is recorded when it is determined that the company will not recover the advances  due to default on scheduled repayment terms  or general economic or market conditions 
impairment testing of goodwill with the implementation of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
in  goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are no longer amortized  but instead are tested at least annually for impairment 
any impairment loss is recognized in income 
in accordance with sfas no  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis 
reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available 
to evaluate goodwill  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
where the carrying value is greater than the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any of the remainder being allocated to goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine whether an impairment loss exists 
the company measures the fair value of reporting units using discounted future cash flows 
because the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity  the discounted future cash flow includes a terminal value 
the long term growth assumptions incorporated into the discounted cash flow calculation reflect the company s long term view of the market and the discount rate is based on our weighted average cost of capital 
these assumptions are subject to change and are also impacted by the company s ability to achieve its forecasts 
each year the company re evaluates the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment 
based on the evaluation performed this year  it was determined that the carrying value of the berry operations in the sunopta fruit group exceeded its fair value 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of  to the consolidated statement of earnings 
in the company impaired goodwill and a trademark in the amount of  primarily due to the exit of certain businesses 
sunopta inc december  k intangible assets intangible assets consist principally of customer relationships  grower relationships  patents and trademarks and licences  distribution agreements and acquired workforce that generally arise from acquisitions 
customer relationships  trademarks and other finite intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis for the period over which we expect to receive economic benefits 
purchase price allocation business acquisitions are accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
under this method  the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the time of the acquisition 
any excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the assumptions and estimates with respect to determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired generally requires the most judgment  and include estimates of future profitability  and or customer and supplier based attrition  income tax rates and discount rates 
changes in any of the assumptions or estimates used in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities could impact the amounts assigned to assets  liabilities  and goodwill in the purchase price allocation 
future net earnings can be affected as a result of changes in these estimates resulting in an asset or goodwill impairment 
accrued expenses and other assets the company is constantly required to make estimates of future payments that will be made and received which relate to current and future accounting periods 
these estimates cover items such as accrued but unpaid wages and bonuses  estimates of taxes and estimates of amounts payable or receivable under legal suits 
in establishing appropriate accruals and receivable balances  management must make judgements regarding the amount of the disbursement or receipts that will ultimately be incurred or received 
in making such assessments  management uses historical experience as well as any other special circumstances surrounding a particular item 
the actual amount paid or received could differ from management s estimate 
income taxes the company is liable for income taxes in the united states  canada  and other jurisdictions where the company has conducted business 
in making an estimate of its income tax liability the company must first make an assessment of which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular jurisdiction 
this process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes 
these differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses result in deferred income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on the company s balance sheet 
the company also makes an estimate on the amount of valuation allowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to reduce future taxes payable 
this judgment is based on forecasted results in the jurisdiction and certain tax planning strategies and as a result actual results may differ from forecasts 
management assesses the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of the tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses and the jurisdiction to which they can be applied to  the number of years based on management s estimate it will take to use the tax assets and any other special circumstances 
if different judgements had been used  the company s income tax liability could have been different from the amount recorded 
in addition  the taxing authorities of those jurisdictions upon audit may not agree with the company s assessment 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the changes in the valuation allowance and the components of the company s deferred tax assets

this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the company recorded a  increase to the income tax provision and opening retained earnings in connection with the company s adoption of fin on january  as of december  and january   the company had total unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of nil for potential foreign exchange gains on certain investments 
all of the unrecognized tax benefits could impact the company s effective tax rate if recognized 
the company does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months of the reporting date 
while the company believes it has adequately provided for all tax positions  amounts asserted by taxing authorities could differ from the company s accrued position 
accordingly  additional provisions on federal  provincial  state and foreign tax related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
stock compensation the company maintains several stock option plans under which incentive stock options may be granted to employees and non employee directors

see additional disclosure related to the inventory adjustments  including a discussion of the impact on previously issued quarterly results in the sunopta fruit group discussion below 
the aforementioned shortfalls in the fruit group s berry operations and sunopta bioprocess were offset by the continued strength in the balance of the food group operations 
the grains and food group realized a increase in operating income  driven by strong demand for natural and organic grains and grain based ingredients and packaged products  combined with the turnaround in the group s sunflower business

the sunopta grains and foods group contributed  in revenues in versus  in  a increase 
this increase was attributed entirely to internal growth driven in part by a rise in commodity prices on soy  corn and sunflower products 
the group realized significant increases in revenues related to higher demand and prices for non gmo and organic grains and grains based food ingredients  including organic oils  sweeteners and dairy products totalling  the group also realized increases of  in aseptic and extended shelf life soy beverage sales due to growth in volumes from existing contracts with major resellers and retailers

price increases and plant efficiencies  together with a strong rebound in crop quality have led to a  improvement in sunflower gross margins 
excluding sunflower operations  gross margins improved by  due mainly to increased volumes  favorable inventory positions in rising commodity markets and operating efficiencies within the group s grain business and the soymilk packaging operations

also contributing to the improved revenue growth was increased healthy fruit snacks revenue of  due to the roll out of new private label programs and innovative products 
the acquisitions of the mexican operations in may global  del rio and bcc and hess contributed  to increased revenue

gross margins in the sunopta fruit group decreased by  in to  or of revenue  as compared to of revenues in the substantial decrease is due to higher inventory and processing costs resulting in lower margins within the berry operations  excluding the mexican acquisition  california berry operations of the fruit group and is described in further detail below 
gross margin contributions from other divisions within the fruit group increased  as compared to an increase of  was attributable to the global sourcing operations due to gains in bulk organic industrial ingredients and private label retail sales of fruit based products 
the acquisitions of the mexican operations and hess provided additional margins of  margin within the healthy fruit snack operations declined by  this was due to plant inefficiency and other start up related operational issues associated with the commissioning of the new bar forming equipment 
specifically  included in cost of goods sold is  related to commissioning costs incurred during trial production on a new equipment line in costs to commission the new equipment line were incurred prior to the equipment attaining commercial viability 
these installations also impaired the ability to price certain customers until production capacity could consistently respond to customer demand 
gross margins declined by  within the california berry operations 
the decline was as a result of an aggressive purchasing strategy which occurred during a time of increasing raw material and input prices 
selling prices were not updated in a timely manner to adequately pass these increased commodity costs on to our customers  which ultimately had a negative impact on gross profit 
margins were further eroded by higher storage costs  increased temporary labor costs and higher overheads  much of which was a direct function of the rise in purchasing volume 
additional operational inefficiencies associated with capital expansion and turnover of key personnel also contributed to the decline in margin 
the increase in carrying value and volume of inventory on hand in relation to a market with abundant supply ultimately resulted in provisions being required to reduce the investment in inventory to nrv 
these provisions were concentrated mainly in bulk industrial and bi product inventory 
at the time of this report  management is working through the existing inventory and has curtailed purchases in order to reduce on hand inventory 
segment operating income in the sunopta fruit group declined by  to a loss of  in in addition to the margin decreases noted above  sg a costs increased  from the prior year 
approximately  of the increase was attributed to additional headcount  quality control resources to ensure the quality and safety of our products  travel to support integration activities and advertising and commissioning costs to support new products and programs 
incremental sg a costs associated with the acquisitions were  and corporate cost allocations increased by  approximately  of the variance is due to provisions recorded against supplier advances that have defaulted on repayment terms 
the losses above were augmented further by incremental foreign exchange losses of  the sunopta fruit group will continue to assess all products  customers and markets to identify pricing or cost efficiency opportunities and will work diligently on driving synergies with the recently acquired tradin operations 
the company has also allocated substantial resources into the berry operations in order to address the business and control issues which impacted the group in the company believes that it can return berry operations to profitable levels  but expects to be a transition year as it sells through the inventory which has been written down to nrv and implements key changes in operations and processes 
the company expects to make the necessary adjustments to bring the business to more manageable levels in before returning to profitable growth in as part of the turnaround  the company has hired a new berry operations president with significant experience in fruit operations and business turnarounds and replaced senior management in this division

business and financial outlook management believes that consumer demand for high quality natural and organic food has grown rapidly over the past decade as global awareness of the benefits of healthy eating continues to proliferate 
the global market for organic foods is currently estimated by management to be in excess of billion and growing at a rate of to annually  with the natural market also large and growing 
while a large number of companies compete within specific segments of the market  the company believes there are relatively few companies as well positioned as sunopta to take advantage of this rapidly growing market 
the company believes that its vertically integrated seed to table business model built over the past nine years has positioned sunopta as a leader in the north american natural and organic foods market 
this has been further strengthened with our recent acquisition of tradin which has increased our international breadth and product scope in organic products 
through a combination of acquisitions and internal growth  the company has realized its previously stated goal of achieving an exit rate of billion in revenues by the end of the company expects to achieve revenues in excess of billion in in the range of  to  an increase of to versus the increase is based on a combination of approximately internal growth and the annualized revenues of acquisitions completed in sunopta inc december  k recent events are expected to delay  but not cease  the company s acquisition based growth strategy 
increased focus on margin improvement  improved internal controls and centralization of key services are key initiatives in capital spending is expected to be curtailed in  with most expenditures relating primarily to baseline maintenance capital requirements needed to maintain existing operations and certain expansion capital for significant new business including the new west coast soy processing and aseptic packaging facility 
management is also heavily focused on executing a working capital reduction plan  which is expected to increase available cash resources and alleviate some of the interest burden the company incurs on its existing debt facilities 
management has also added key experienced operational personnel in both the sunopta fruit group  and at the corporate level to help drive these initiatives 
the company s overall strategy remains intact and the goal of profitable growth through an effective balance of internal growth and acquisitions in support of its vertically integrated seed to table strategy has not changed 
the company continues to look for ways to improve the strategic synergies across its food group operations  vertically integrating wherever possible 
initiatives to improve the productivity of the operations include product rationalization  plant and warehouse rationalization programs  continued training and development of employees  consolidated procurement  supply chain and internal services programs and consolidated information and accounting systems to provide better analysis and timely decision making 
a more fulsome discussion of key strategies is included in item of this report

the company  including opta minerals  also has unused revolving acquisition lines totaling approximately  the company s remaining cash and unused lines plus cash generated from operations are sufficient to finance capital maintenance estimated at  to  annual debt service of  and payment of the remaining current portion of long term liabilities of  additional sources of cash could be obtained through a combination of additional bank or subordinated financing  a private or public offering  or the issuance of shares in relation to an acquisition or through a divestiture

sunopta inc december  k item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and limit risk 
to achieve this objective  the company may invest its excess cash in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as cash and cash equivalents or short term investments and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported through profit and loss 
as at december  all of sunopta s excess funds were held in cash and cash equivalents with a maturity less than days 
debt in both fixed rate and floating rate interest carry different types of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt may have their fair market value adversely affected by a decline in interest rates 
in general  longer term debts are subject to greater interest rate risk than shorter term securities 
floating rate term debt gives less predictability to cash flows as interest rates change 
as at december   the weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate term debt was and   of the company s outstanding term debt is at fixed interest rates 
variable rate term debt of   at an interest rate of is partially hedged by variable rate cash equivalent investments 
the company looks at various factors to determine the percentage of debt to hold at fixed rates including  the interest rate spread between variable and fixed swap rates  the company s view on interest rate trends  the percent of offset to variable rate debt through holding variable rate investments and the company s ability to manage with interest rate volatility and uncertainty 
for every increase decrease in interest rates the company s after tax earnings would increase decrease by approximately opta minerals entered into a cash flow hedge in at inception  the fair value of the cash flow hedge was determined to be a loss of  using mark to market valuations which required an immediate expense of the ineffective portion 
the cash flow hedge entered into exchanged a notional amount of cdn  us  from a floating rate to a fixed rate of from august to august the fair value of the hedging derivative is estimated based on the standard swap valuation methodology 
the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was a loss of  foreign currency risk all us subsidiaries and sunopta bioprocess use the us dollar as their functional currency and the us dollar is also the company s reporting currency 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the company and its canadian subsidiaries excluding sunopta bioprocess are translated into us dollars on consolidation 
during  the canadian dollar appreciated significantly against the us dollar with closing rates moving from cdn at december  to cdn at december  for each us dollar 
the us dollar also depreciated significantly against the euro 
the net effect of this depreciation has been an exchange gain included in accumulated other comprehensive income of  loss of 
during  the company had a   increase in net canadian assets 
a movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates in favour of against the canadian dollar with all other variables held constant would result in an increase decrease in the fair value of the company s net canadian assets by  
the functional currency of all operations located in canada  with the exception of sunopta bioprocess  is the canadian dollar 
for these operations all transaction gains or losses in relation to the us dollar are recorded as foreign exchange gain loss in the consolidated statement of earnings while gains losses on translation of net assets to us dollars on consolidation are recorded in the currency translation adjustment account within shareholders equity 
the functional currency of the corporate head office is the us dollar 
transaction gains or losses as well as gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities are recorded within foreign exchange gains losses on the consolidated statement of earnings 
us based food group operations have limited exposure to other currencies since almost all sales and purchases are made in us dollars 
it is the company s intention to hold excess funds in the currency in which the funds are likely to be used  which will from time to time potentially expose the company to exchange rate fluctuations when converted into us dollars 
sunopta inc december  k commodity risk the food group enters into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on grain transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk from market price fluctuations 
futures contracts used for hedging purposes are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges 
inventories  however  may not be completely hedged  due in part to the company s assessment of its exposure from expected price fluctuations 
exchange purchase and sales contracts may expose the company to risk in the event that a counter party to a transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation 
the company manages its risk by entering into purchase contracts with pre approved producers 
the company has a risk of loss from hedge activity if a grower does not deliver the grain as scheduled 
sales contracts are entered into with organizations of acceptable creditworthiness  as internally evaluated 
all futures transactions are marked to market as they do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes 
gains and losses on futures transactions related to grain inventories are included in cost of goods sold 
at december  the company owned   bushels of corn with a weighted average price of and   bushels of soy beans with a weighted average price of 
the company has at december  net long short positions on soy beans of   and a net long short position on corn of   bushels 
an increase decrease in the commodity prices of either soy or corn of would result in an increase decrease in carrying value of these commodities by  there are no futures contracts in the other sunopta food group segments  opta minerals  sunopta bioprocess or related to corporate office activities
