item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and the discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements 
total real estate rental revenue as of april   our real estate portfolio consisted of multi family residential properties and commercial properties  consisting of office  medical  industrial and retail properties  comprising     and  respectively  of our total real estate portfolio  based on the dollar amount of our original investment plus capital improvements  net of accumulated depreciation  through april  gross annual rental revenue and percentages of total annual real estate rental revenue by property type for each of the three most recent fiscal years ended april  are as follows annual report fiscal year ended april  in thousands multi family residential gross revenue commercial office gross revenue commercial medical gross revenue commercial industrial gross revenue commercial retail gross revenue total revenue economic occupancy rates economic occupancy levels on a stabilized property and all property basis are shown below for each property type in each of the three most recent fiscal years ended april economic occupancy represents actual rental revenues recognized for the period indicated as a percentage of scheduled rental revenues for the period 
percentage rents  tenant concessions  straightline adjustments and expense reimbursements are not considered in computing either actual revenues or scheduled rent revenues 
scheduled rent revenue is determined by valuing occupied units or square footage at contract rates and vacant units or square footage at market rates 
stabilized properties are those properties owned for the entirety of both periods being compared 
while results presented on a stabilized property basis are not determined in accordance with gaap  management believes that measuring performance on a stabilized property basis is useful to investors and to management because it enables evaluation of how the company s properties are performing year over year 
in the case of multi family residential properties  lease arrangements with individual tenants vary from month to month to one year leases 
leases on commercial properties generally vary from month to month to years

accordingly  we have organized a number of wholly owned subsidiary corporations  and iret properties has organized several limited partnerships  for the purpose of holding title in an entity that complies with such lending conditions 
all financial statements of these subsidiaries are consolidated into our financial statements 
management and leasing of our real estate assets we conduct our operations from offices in minot  north dakota  minneapolis  minnesota and omaha  nebraska 
we also have property management offices in st 
louis  missouri  jamestown  north dakota and kansas city  kansas 
the day to day management of our commercial properties is carried out by our own employees and by third party property management companies 
the management and leasing of our multi family residential properties are handled by locally based  third party management companies 
in markets where the amount of rentable square footage we own does not justify self management  when properties acquired have effective pre existing property management in place  or when for other reasons particular properties are in our judgment not attractive candidates for self management  we utilize third party professional management companies for day to day management 
however  all decisions relating to purchase  sale  insurance coverage  capital improvements  approval of commercial leases  annual operating budgets and major renovations are made exclusively by our employees and implemented by the third party management companies 
as of april   we have under internal management commercial properties 
our remaining commercial properties are managed by third parties 
we plan to continue evaluating our portfolio to identify other commercial properties that may be candidates for management by our own employees

with respect to multi tenant commercial properties  we rely almost exclusively on third party brokers to locate potential tenants 
as compensation  brokers may receive a commission that is generally calculated as a percentage of the net rent to be paid over the term of the lease

we operate on a fiscal year ending on april the following discussion and analysis is for the fiscal year ended april  overview we are a self advised equity real estate investment trust engaged in owning and operating income producing real properties 
our investments include multi family residential properties and commercial properties located primarily in the upper midwest states of minnesota and north dakota 
our properties are diversified in property type and location 
as of april   our real estate portfolio consisted of multi family residential properties containing  apartment units and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  and commercial properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of billion 
our commercial properties consist of office properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  medical properties including senior housing containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  annual report industrial properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  and retail properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million 
our primary source of income and cash is rents associated with multi family residential and commercial leases 
our business objective is to increase shareholder value by employing a disciplined investment strategy 
this strategy is focused on growing assets in desired geographical markets  achieving diversification by property type and location  and adhering to targeted returns in acquiring properties 
the uncertainty and volatility in the economy and credit markets during fiscal year restrained demand for commercial office  retail and industrial space throughout our portfolio 
while we expect our medical and multi family segments show increased demand  we currently see no growing demand for commercial office  retail or industrial space in iret s markets 
we expect continuing deterioration in the economy to increase credit stresses on our tenants through at least the first and second quarters of our current fiscal year  which we expect will lead to moderate increases for us in past due accounts and vacancies 
despite these market uncertainties  and a tightening in credit standards by lenders during the latter half of fiscal year in particular  iret during fiscal year acquired eight senior housing facilities  seven medical office properties  four office warehouse properties  three commercial office properties and one multi family residential complex for purchase prices totaling million  excluding transaction costs  and completed construction of an additional multi family residential property for a cost of million 
during fiscal year  the company sold two properties and two buildings of an apartment community for an aggregate sale price of million 
additionally  during fiscal year iret completed a public offering of million common shares for net proceeds of approximately million 
total revenues of iret properties  our operating partnership  increased by million to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to the addition of new real estate properties 
operating income increased in fiscal year  to million from million in fiscal year we estimate that rent concessions offered to tenants during the twelve months ended april  lowered our operating revenues by approximately million  compared to million for fiscal year expenses increased during fiscal year as well  with real estate taxes  maintenance  utilities and property management expense all increasing from year earlier levels 
while some of this increase was due to existing real estate  the majority was due to the addition of new real estate properties to our portfolio 
on an all property basis  economic occupancy levels in our total commercial property segments decreased slightly to in fiscal year from in fiscal year economic occupancy rates in our commercial office segment increased  the economic occupancy rates in our commercial medical  industrial and retail segments decreased 
economic occupancy in our multi family residential segment decreased to in fiscal year on an all property basis  from in fiscal year additional information and more detailed discussions of our fiscal year operating results are found in the following sections of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
real estate 
real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  less an adjustment for impairment  if any 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
as described further below  the process of allocating property costs to its components involves a considerable amount of subjective judgments to be made by company management 
if the company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company uses a year estimated life for buildings and improvements and a year estimated life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
maintenance and repairs are charged to annual report operations as incurred 
renovations and improvements that improve and or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life  generally five to ten years 
upon acquisitions of real estate  the company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible assets including land  buildings and personal property  which is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and considers whether there were significant intangible assets acquired for example  above and below market leases  the value of acquired in place leases  and tenant relationships  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and acquired liabilities  and allocates the purchase price based on these assessments 
the as if vacant value is allocated to land  buildings  and personal property based on management s determination of the relative fair value of these assets 
the estimated fair value of the property is the amount that would be recoverable upon the disposition of the property 
techniques used to estimate fair value include discounted cash flow analysis and reference to recent sales of comparable properties 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
land value is assigned based on the purchase price if land is acquired separately  or based on estimated market value if acquired in a merger or in a portfolio acquisition 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are estimated based on the present value of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the company performs this analysis on a lease by lease basis 
the capitalized above market or below market intangible is amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based upon the company s evaluation of the specific characteristics of the leases 
factors considered in these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods  considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the company also considers information about each property obtained during its pre acquisition due diligence and marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers and sufficient consideration is received by the company and the company has no significant continuing involvement with the property sold 
the company s properties are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
this review requires management to exercise judgment  including making estimates about the future performance of the properties being reviewed 
if the company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows  initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different 
the impact of the company s estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to the company s financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts approximately  as of april  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their respective lease agreements 
the company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents approximately  as of april  and from mortgage loans approximately  as of april  
the straight lining of rents receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
if estimates differ from actual results this would impact reported results 
revenue recognition the company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rents income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis  which includes the effects of rent increases and abated rent under the leases 
certain leases provide for tenant occupancy during periods for which no rent is due or where minimum rent payments increase during the term of the lease 
rental revenue is recorded for the full term of each lease on a straight line basis 
accordingly  the company records a receivable from tenants for rents that it expects to collect over the remaining lease term as deferred rents receivable 
when the company acquires a property  the term of the existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes annual report of this calculation 
revenue recognition is considered to be critical because the evaluation of the reliability of such deferred rents receivable involves management s assumptions relating to such tenant s viability 
percentage rents income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold 
these rents are recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition  which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  sales thresholds have been achieved 
expense reimbursement income revenue arising from tenant leases  which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
income taxes 
the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a reit under sections of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a distribution to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
the company intends to distribute to its shareholders of its taxable income 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is required 
if the company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders  it would fail to qualify as a reit and substantial adverse tax consequences may result 
the company s taxable income is affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following that the company s tenants perform their obligations under their leases with the company  that the company s tax and accounting positions do not change  and that the number of issued and outstanding shares of the company s common stock remain relatively unchanged 
these factors  which impact the company s taxable income  are subject to change  and many are outside the control of the company 
if actual results vary  the company s taxable income may change 
recent accounting pronouncements for disclosure regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the anticipated impact they will have on our operations  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations revenues total revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year revenues during fiscal year were million greater than revenues in fiscal year and revenues during fiscal year were million greater than in fiscal year for fiscal  the increase in revenue of million resulted from in thousands rent from properties acquired in fiscal year in excess of that received in from the same properties rent from properties acquired in fiscal year increase in rental income on existing properties decrease in lease termination fees for fiscal  the increase in revenue of million resulted from in thousands rent from properties acquired in fiscal year in excess of that received in from the same properties rent from properties acquired in fiscal year increase in rental income on existing properties decrease in lease termination fees annual report as illustrated above  the substantial majority in fiscal year and in fiscal year of the increase in our gross revenue for fiscal years and resulted from the addition of new real estate properties to the iret properties portfolio  with and  respectively  resulting from rental increases on existing properties 
for the next months  we expect acquisitions to continue to be the most significant factor in any increases in our revenues and ultimately our net income 
however  domestic financial markets have recently been experiencing unusual volatility and uncertainty 
although this has occurred most visibly within the single family mortgage lending sector of the credit market  liquidity has tightened in overall domestic financial markets  including the equity capital markets 
consequently  there is greater uncertainty regarding our ability to access the credit markets in order to attract financing on reasonable terms  and our ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected 
at the same time  though  these credit market dislocations may offer investment opportunities  as potential acquisitions may become more attractive due to moderating commercial real estate price increases 
additionally  joint venture and development opportunities may become more plentiful  due to an increase in the number of smaller developers who currently have constrained access to equity capital  and are seeking investment partners 
gain on sale of real estate the company realized a gain on sale of real estate  land and other investments for fiscal year of approximately  this compares to million of gain on sale of real estate recognized in fiscal and million recognized in fiscal a list of the properties sold during fiscal year  showing sales price  depreciated cost plus sales costs and net gain is included in this item under the caption property dispositions 
net operating income the following tables report segment financial information 
we measure the performance of our segments based on net operating income noi  which we define as total revenues less property operating expenses and real estate taxes 
we believe that noi is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a reit s operating real estate because it provides a measure of core operations that is unaffected by depreciation  amortization  financing and general and administrative expense 
noi does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income  net income available for common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities as a measure of financial performance 
the following tables show revenues  operating expenses and noi by reportable operating segment for fiscal years  and for a reconciliation of net operating income of reportable segments to operating income as reported  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
the tables also show net operating income by reportable operating segment on a stabilized property and non stabilized property basis 
stabilized properties are properties owned and in operation for the entirety of the periods being compared including properties that were redeveloped or expanded during the periods being compared  with properties purchased or sold during the periods being compared excluded from the stabilized property category 
this comparison allows the company to evaluate the performance of existing properties and their contribution to net income 
management believes that measuring performance on a stabilized property basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how the company s properties are performing year over year 
management uses this measure to assess whether or not it has been successful in increasing net operating income  renewing the leases of existing tenants  controlling operating costs and appropriately handling capital improvements

iret uses the definition of ffo adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit in  as clarified in  and nareit defines ffo to mean net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
because of limitations of the ffo definition adopted by nareit  iret has made certain interpretations in applying the definition 
iret believes all such interpretations not specifically provided for in the nareit definition are consistent with the definition 
annual report iret management considers that ffo  by excluding depreciation costs  the gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate properties and extraordinary items as defined by gaap  is useful to investors in providing an additional perspective on iret s operating results 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation  that the value of real estate assets decreases predictably over time 
however  real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
nareit s definition of ffo  by excluding depreciation costs  reflects the fact that real estate  as an asset class  generally appreciates over time and that depreciation charges required by gaap may not reflect underlying economic realities 
additionally  the exclusion  in nareit s definition of ffo  of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  allows iret management and investors to better identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of iret s investments  and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
ffo is used by iret s management and investors to identify trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating costs 
while ffo is widely used by reits as a primary performance metric  not all real estate companies use the same definition of ffo or calculate ffo in the same way 
accordingly  ffo presented here is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of iret s performance  but rather should be considered as an additional  supplemental measure  and should be viewed in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  and is not necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of iret s needs or its ability to service indebtedness or make distributions 
ffo applicable to common shares and limited partnership units for the fiscal year ended april  increased to million  compared to million and million for the fiscal years ended april  and  respectively

net income is calculated on a per share basis 
ffo is calculated on a per share and unit basis 
in accordance with sec and nareit guidance  iret does not exclude impairment write downs from ffo that is  impairment charges are not added back to gaap net income in calculating ffo 
iret recorded impairment charges of  and for the fiscal years ended april   and  respectively 
if these impairment charges are excluded from the company s calculation of ffo  the company s ffo per share and unit would be unchanged for fiscal year  and would increase by one cent per share and unit in each of fiscal years and  to 
and 
per share and unit  respectively 
annual report cash distributions the following cash distributions were paid to our common shareholders and upreit unitholders during fiscal years  and fiscal years quarters first second third fourth the fiscal year cash distributions increased over the cash distributions paid during fiscal year  and fiscal year cash distributions increased over the cash distributions paid during fiscal year  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources overview management expects that the company s principal liquidity demands will continue to be distributions to holders of the company s preferred and common shares of beneficial interest and upreit units  capital improvements and repairs and maintenance to the company s properties  acquisition of additional properties  property development  debt repayments and tenant improvements 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements through net cash flows provided by its operating activities  and through draws from time to time on its unsecured lines of credit 
management considers the company s ability to generate cash to be adequate to meet all operating requirements and to make distributions to its shareholders in accordance with the reit provisions of the internal revenue code 
budgeted expenditures for ongoing maintenance and capital improvements and renovations to our real estate portfolio are expected to be funded from cash flow generated from operations of current properties 
to the extent the company does not satisfy its long term liquidity requirements  which consist primarily of maturities under the company s long term debt  construction and development activities and potential acquisition opportunities  through net cash flows provided by operating activities and its credit facilities  the company intends to satisfy such requirements through a combination of funding sources which the company believes will be available to it  including the issuance of upreit units  additional common or preferred equity  proceeds from the sale of properties  and additional long term secured or unsecured indebtedness 
sources and uses of cash as of april   the company had three unsecured lines of credit  in the amounts of million  million and million  respectively  from bremer bank  minot  nd  first western bank and trust  minot  nd  and first international bank and trust  watford city  nd

increases in interest rates will increase the company s interest expense on any borrowings under its lines of credit  and as a result will affect the company s results of operations and cash flows 
the company s lines of credit with bremer bank  first western bank and first international bank and trust expire in september  december and december  respectively 
the company expects to renew these lines of credit prior to their expiration

during fiscal year  approximately million common shares were issued under this plan  with an additional million common shares issued during fiscal year  and million common shares issued during fiscal year the issuance of upreit units for property acquisitions continues to be a source of capital for the company 
approximately million units were issued in connection with property acquisitions during fiscal year  and approximately million units and million units  respectively  were issued in connection with property acquisitions during fiscal years and primarily as a result of the conversion of upreit units and the issuance of common shares pursuant to our shelf registration statement and distribution reinvestment plan  net of fractional shares repurchased  the company s equity capital increased during fiscal by million

net cash provided from financing activities increased to million during fiscal year  from million during fiscal year  also due primarily to an increase in proceeds received from mortgage borrowings and refinancings 
financial condition mortgage loan indebtedness

this limits the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  which minimizes the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the company s results of operations and cash flows
