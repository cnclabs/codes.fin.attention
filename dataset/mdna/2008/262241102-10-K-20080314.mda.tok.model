overview drugstore 
com  inc 
is a leading online provider of health  beauty  vision  and pharmacy products 
we believe that we offer a better way for consumers to shop for these products through our web stores  including those located on the internet at www 
drugstore 
com  www 
beauty 
com  www 
visiondirect 
com  www 
lensmart

we operate on a week retail calendar  with each quarter in a week fiscal year representing a week period 
fiscal years   and were week fiscal years 
references in the following discussion to yearly periods are to fiscal years  unless the context indicates otherwise 
the year refers to the fiscal year ended december   year refers to the fiscal year ended december   and refers to the fiscal year ended january  business segments  growth strategies 
we operate our business in four business segments otc  vision  mail order pharmacy  and local pick up pharmacy 
over the counter otc 
our otc segment includes all non prescription products sold online through our web stores at www 
drugstore 
com and www 
beauty 
com or over the telephone at drugstore  including customized nutritional supplements sold through our subsidiary cns 
before december   we recognized all sales of customized vitamins through cns on a gross basis  net of promotional discounts  cancellations  rebates  and returns allowances 
on december   we entered into a fulfillment agreement with weil 
under the terms of the new agreement  which replaced our previous agreement with weil  we recognize the revenue associated with the fulfillment of customized vitamins sold through weil on a net basis 
until november   our otc segment also included product revenues and fulfillment fees received under our wholesale otc fulfillment agreement with amazon 
com  inc  under which we acted as a nonexclusive wholesaler and fulfillment provider for certain otc products sold through the health personal care store on the amazon 
com website 
effective november   we terminated this agreement 
the change in the terms of our agreement with weil  which led us to recognize revenue on a net basis for the substantial majority of our cns revenue  and the termination of the amazon 
com wholesale otc agreement make it more difficult to provide a meaningful year over year comparison 
accordingly  in this annual report we refer to our core otc net sales  which is a non gaap measure that excludes from otc net sales wholesale otc net sales of million for the year ended january  and cns net sales of million  million and million for the years ended december   december   and january   respectively 
our management believes that the presentation of core otc net sales and related information provides useful information to the company and its stockholders  because it excludes specific items that are no longer indicative of our core operating results and facilitates a more meaningful comparison of year over year results of our otc segment 
we source our otc products from various manufacturers and distributors  including drop ship arrangements with vendors 
we believe that continued growth in this segment will depend on our ability to offer customers a superior shopping experience and service  including providing a broad selection of basic necessity items and hard to find specialty items  which encourages customers to return to our websites and make repeat  replenishment  and impulse purchases 
in  we anticipate growth in our otc segment  specifically our prestige beauty business  as we attract new brands and expand our marketing channels 
we will also continue our diversification driving our free search results and adding several new marketplaces and accelerating our margin improvements with targeted shipping  sourcing  and pricing initiatives

we sell over  prescription drugs  including many specialty drugs for the treatment of chronic conditions such as cancer  hiv  and multiple sclerosis  which are not carried by brick and mortar pharmacies and require special handling or service 
in this segment  we focus our marketing efforts directly on consumers online and through doctors to maximize growth in our cash prescription and specialty pharmacy business 
in addition to the sale of prescription drugs  we sell advertising on our website  to monetize the more than one million unique visitors per month researching drugs and other healthcare content provided on the site

com web store or the rite aid web store at www 
riteaid 
com which is powered by the drugstore 
com web store or over the telephone and picked up by customers at rite aid stores 
in this segment  rite aid acts as our fulfillment partner 
our success in this segment depends on our ability to leverage our relationship with rite aid through its marketing media  including rite aid store receipts  weekly rite aid advertising circulars  and e mail refill reminders 
in  we anticipate consistent year over year growth in net sales in the local pick up pharmacy segment  as we focus the majority of our marketing efforts on our other segments

our revenues in also benefited from year over year growth of in our vision segment and in our local pick up pharmacy segment 
these increases were partially offset by a year over year decrease in mail order pharmacy net sales of 
expenses 
our operating expenses  including cost of goods sold  decreased as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in the decrease reflects both a favorable shift in our product mix to higher margin otc sales  as well as improvement in each of our business segment s margins 
this decrease was partially offset with an increase in our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in  primarily as a result of a million charge related to an estimate recorded for taxes and interest on an unfavorable ruling in the nj sales tax case

significant accounting judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec defines a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the significant accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies that involve the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
we have included additional information about our significant accounting policies in note of our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions  and judgments are reasonable  they are based on information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments  or conditions 
in addition  any significant unanticipated changes in any of our assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an 
table of contents arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price or fee earned is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
otc vision  and mail order 
we record revenues from sales of otc  vision  and mail order pharmacy when the products are shipped and title passes to customers  net of promotional discounts  cancellations  rebates  and returns allowances 
we generally require payment by credit card at the point of sale 
we estimate return allowances  which reduce product sales by our estimate of expected product returns  based on our historical experience 
historically  product returns have not been significant and have not differed significantly from our estimates 
from time to time  we provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases 
such offers include discounts on specific current purchases  or future rebates based on a percentage of the current purchase  as well as other offers 
we treat discounts  when our customers accept them  as a reduction in the sales price of the related transaction and we present them as a net amount in net sales 
we treat rebates as a reduction in the sales price based on estimated redemption rates 
we estimate redemption rates using our historical experience for similar offers 
historically  our redemption rates have not differed materially from our estimates  which we adjust quarterly 
we also evaluate the criteria of emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or eitf generally  when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction  are subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers  or have several but not all of these indicators  we record revenue on a gross basis 
if we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage  a fixed payment schedule  or a combination of the two  we record revenue on a net basis 
we record revenues generated by the gnc agreement in our otc segment on a net basis because we do not take title to the inventory and do not establish pricing 
we record revenues generated by the weil agreement in our otc segment on a net basis  because we act as an agent  based on the fact that we earn a fixed dollar amount per customer transaction regardless of the amount billed to the customer  and we do not bear general inventory risk associated with these sales we record revenues generated from the amazon 
com agreement in our otc segment on a gross basis  because we act as a principal  based on the fact that we are subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers 
prior to this agreement  effective november   we terminated a separate fulfillment agreement with amazon 
com 
under the terminated agreement  we recorded fulfillment fees and revenues on a gross basis  because we acted as a principal and bore general inventory risk 
we record revenues generated from our drop ship arrangements with vendors agreement in our otc segment on a gross basis when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction  are subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers  or have several but not all of these indicators 
we also evaluate the criteria of emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  when we enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf establishes three criteria that must be met in order for the deliverables in the arrangement to be treated as separate units of accounting  the delivered item has value on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
when the separation criteria are not met  the delivered item is accounted for as a combined unit of accounting with the undelivered item 
therefore  revenue for the delivered and undelivered items is recognized over the service period of the last delivered item or if it is not a service  when the last item is delivered 
prescription sales 
for insured prescriptions in both our local pick up and mail order segments  the co payment and the insurance reimbursement which together make up the amount due to drugstore 
com constitute the full value of the prescription drug sale  and we receive this entire amount as cash 
we therefore recognize the entire amount as revenue when we ship the order to the customer for mail order prescriptions or when the customer picks up the order for local pick up prescriptions 

table of contents local pick up 
we recognize revenues from sales of prescription products ordered online or by telephone through the drugstore 
com web store or the riteaid 
com web store which is powered by the drugstore 
com web store for pick up at a rite aid store  including co payments that rite aid receives and collects on our behalf when the customer picks up the product 
in these circumstances  we use rite aid as our fulfillment partner 
we record revenues in our local pick up pharmacy segment on a gross basis  because we act as a principal  based on the fact that  among other things  we bear both inventory risk and credit and collection risk associated with these sales 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost using the weighted average cost method or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust our inventories for shrinkage and slow moving  damaged  and expired inventory  which we record as the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on management s assumptions about future demand for the products we offer and market conditions 
we use a variety of methods to reduce the quantity of slow moving inventory  including reducing sales prices on our websites  negotiating returns to vendors  and liquidating inventory through third parties 
if our estimates of future product demand or our assumptions about market conditions are inaccurate  we could understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
historically  inventory reserves have not differed materially from our estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangibles  or sfas  we test for impairment of goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever indicators of impairment occur 
the first phase of the test screens for impairment 
if we determine impairment  the second phase measures the amount of impairment by comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine fair value using either a discounted cash flow methodology or methodology based on comparable market prices 
this analysis uses a multi year forecast of estimated cash flows and a terminal value at the end of the cash flow period 
the forecast period assumptions consist of internal projections that are based on our budget and long range strategic plan 
the discount rate used at the testing date is our weighted average cost of capital 
the assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis require judgment  and changes to these inputs could materially impact the results of the calculation 
we review our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment when indicators of impairment occur and annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
we compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value and record an impairment charge when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  we review the carrying values of our amortized long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  whenever an indicator of impairment occurs 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  we perform an evaluation of recoverability 
we determine whether impairment exists based on any excess of the carrying value over the expected future cash flows  as estimated through undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges 
we measure any resulting impairment charge based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value  as estimated through expected future discounted cash flows  discounted at a rate of return for an alternate investment 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
we calculate the fair value of our stock options granted to employees using the black scholes option pricing model using the single option approach 

table of contents this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
we base our computation of expected volatility on our historical volatility  adjusted for changes in capital structure and corporate changes  information available that may indicate future volatility  and observable mean reversion tendencies of historical volatility 
through the third quarter of  we computed expected life of stock based awards using the simplified method outlined by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  or sab under this method  our expected term was equal to the sum of the weighted average vesting term plus the original contractual term divided by two  which resulted in a six year expected term 
in the fourth quarter of  we developed reasonable and supportable expected term estimates utilizing a comprehensive weighted average life wal analysis 
the wal analysis provides a historical based platform for use in developing expected term estimates for the future based on the historically observed time periods from grant date through post vesting activities  such as exercise and cancellation 
we base the risk free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
where the expected term of our stock based awards does not correspond with the terms for which interest rates are quoted  we average the rates quoted for the closest available term maturities 
a dividend yield of is considered appropriate as we have not issued and do not anticipate issuing any dividends in the near future 
when estimating forfeitures  we consider historical voluntary termination behavior in addition to actual option forfeitures 
in conjunction with this analysis  we identified distinct subgroups non management employees  management employees  our chief executive officer  board members  and other non employees 
we apply an estimated forfeiture rate of approximately to non management and management employee subgroups  based on the weighted average termination behavior of those subgroups 
we apply a forfeiture rate of to our chief executive officer  board members  and non employees 
if our estimated forfeiture rate changes  we retrospectively increase or decrease stock based compensation in the period of change 
any such revisions to the estimates we use to calculate the fair value of our stock based awards could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
see note of our consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans  included in part iv  item of this annual report 
legal proceedings we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and legal proceedings and may revise our estimates 
any such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position

table of contents liquidity sources  requirements and contractual cash requirements and commitments our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
historically  our principal liquidity requirements have been to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
our primary source of cash is sales made through our websites  for which we collect cash from credit card settlements or insurance reimbursements 
our primary uses of cash are purchases of inventory  salaries  marketing expenses  and overhead and fixed costs 
any projections of our future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty for the reasons discussed in this section and in the section entitled risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report 
in december  we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with a bank 
in january  we borrowed million on the line of credit and in december  we converted the million line of credit into a term loan 
the term loan totaled  and  as of december  and december   respectively  and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest at a rate of prime rate plus at december  and at december  
in addition  the agreement includes a million term loan for capital equipment expenditures that accrues interest on the outstanding principal balance at a rate of prime rate plus 
this term loan is payable in equal monthly installments of principal  plus accrued interest  beginning on february  and ending on january  the balance outstanding under this term loan was  and  as december  and december   respectively 
our equipment  inventory  accounts receivable  cash  and intangible assets collateralize the borrowings under the agreement 
the agreement contains certain financial and non financial covenants with which we were in compliance at december  in april  we amended our amended and restated loan and security agreement with our existing bank 
the current agreement includes a revolving line of credit allowing for borrowings of up to million  which accrue interest at the prime rate at december  
the revolving line of credit matures in march the agreement allows for the conversion of up to million of the outstanding balance into a term loan within days of maturity 
for the year ended december   borrowings under the existing line of credit totaled million  of which million was converted into a term loan in april  million was repaid and million remains outstanding as of december  the term loan totaled  as of december  and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest at a rate of prime rate plus at december  in october  we entered into an agreement to lease computer equipment under a non cancelable capital lease 
with respect to each draw under this lease  of the sum of the draw amount plus interest determined at the time of the draw was payable in monthly installments over the months following the draw 
at the end of the month period  we had the option to either pay the remaining in a single balloon payment or extend financing for an additional months 
all draws under this lease  which were limited to million  were completed by june we had drawn the entire million under this lease  payable in monthly installments of  at an interest rate of 
as of december   we had paid off the lease  including the balloon payment of  as of december   the amount due under the agreement was  in july  we entered into an agreement to finance equipment in our distribution center totaling million under a non cancelable capital lease 
the lease is payable in monthly installments of approximately  beginning january and ending december  and accrues interest at a rate of 
as of december  and december   the amount due under the agreement was million and million  respectively 
we also lease computer equipment under non cancelable capital leases 
capital lease obligations bear interest at rates ranging from to and mature to months from the date of funding 
we secured additional funds of  during and  during  through capital lease financing agreements  
table of contents through which we financed certain computer equipment  software  fixtures  and equipment for periods of two and three years 
as of december   we are in compliance with all covenants required by these agreements

term loans and line of credit include debt obligations with a bank 
operating lease obligations consist of office building  distribution center  and call center leases 
we do not have any future material noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services 
we believe that our cash and marketable securities on hand plus our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
however  any projections about our future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
as a result  we may need to raise additional monies to fund our operating activities or for strategic flexibility if  for example  we decide to pursue business or technology acquisitions or if our expectations regarding our operations and anticipated capital expenditures change 
we have assessed in the past  and will continue to assess  opportunities for raising additional funds by selling equity  equity related or debt securities  obtaining additional credit facilities  or obtaining other means of financing for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms when required  or at all 
furthermore  if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of securities  such securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience additional dilution 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have assessed our vulnerability to certain market risks  including interest rate risk associated with marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  capital lease obligations  and cash and cash equivalents 
due to the short term nature of these investments and our investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments is not material to us 
we have interest rate exposure arising from our financing facilities  which have variable rates 
these variable interest rates are affected by changes in short term interest rates 
we manage our interest rate exposure by maintaining a conservative debt to equity ratio 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows will not be material 
our financing facilities expose our net earnings to changes in short term interest rates because interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
borrowings outstanding under the variable interest bearing financing facilities totaled million at december   and the highest interest rate attributable to this outstanding balance was at december  a change in net earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material 
we have investment risk exposure arising from our investments in marketable securities due to volatility of the stock market in general  company specific circumstances  and changes in general economic conditions 
as of december   we had million of securities classified as marketable securities 
we regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary
