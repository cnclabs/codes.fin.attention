item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary overview of schering plough schering plough is an innovation driven science centered global health care company 
schering plough discovers  develops and manufactures pharmaceuticals for three customer markets human prescription  animal health  and consumer 
while most of the research and development activity is directed toward prescription products  there are important applications of this central research and development platform into the animal health products and the consumer health care products 
schering plough also accesses external innovation via partnering  in licensing and acquisition for all three customer markets 
strategy focused on science earlier this decade  schering plough experienced a number of business  regulatory  and legal challenges 
in april  the board of directors named fred hassan as the new chairman of the board and chief executive officer of schering plough corporation 
with support from the board  he initiated a strategic plan  with the goal of stabilizing  repairing and turning around schering plough in order to build long term shareholder value 
he also installed a new senior executive team 
that strategic plan  the action agenda  is a six to eight year  five phase plan 
schering plough is currently in the fourth phase of the action agenda build the base 
during the build the base phase  schering plough continues to focus on its strategy of value creation across a broad front  and believes the organon biosciences nv obs acquisition was a major  transformative accomplishment in this regard 
the obs acquisition added further diversification of marketed products  including two new therapeutic areas women s health and central nervous system  as well as significant strength in animal health products and pipeline 
other accomplishments in include growing the business  for example there was double digit sales growth in all three product groups  human pharmaceuticals  animal health and consumer health care  penetrating new markets  including china  brazil and russia  expanding the product portfolio for schering plough s three customer groups human pharmaceutical  animal health and consumer health care  and discovering and developing or acquiring new products 
a key component of the action agenda is applying science to meet unmet medical needs 
research and development activities focus on mechanisms to treat serious diseases 
as a result  a core strategy of schering plough is to invest substantial funds in scientific research with the goal of creating therapies and treatments that address important unmet medical needs and also have commercial value 
schering plough has been successful in advancing its pipeline into several late stage projects that will require sizable resources to complete 
consistent with this core strategy  schering plough is increasing its investment in research and development 
as schering plough continues to develop the later phase growth drivers of the pipeline eg  sugammadex  thrombin receptor antagonist  golimumab  vicriviroc  boceprevir and asenapine  it anticipates higher spending on clinical trial activities 
schering plough s progressing early pipeline includes drug candidates across a wide range of therapeutic areas with more than compounds now approaching or in phase i development 
as part of the action agenda  schering plough continues to work to enhance infrastructure  upgrade processes and systems and strengthen talent both the recruitment of talented individuals and the development of key employees 
while these efforts are being implemented on a companywide basis  schering plough is focusing especially on research and development to support schering plough s science based business 

table of contents further  with the integration of the obs employees into schering plough much new talent has been added 
in addition  as part of the integration of obs  schering plough has also announced that there will be some workforce reduction to eliminate redundancies 
results highlights of schering plough s performance in are as follows closed the acquisition of obs on november  for a purchase price of approximately euro billion 
schering plough s net sales in were billion  an increase of billion  or percent  as compared to the period 
net sales included million of sales of products acquired as part of the obs acquisition 
net loss available to common shareholders in was billion  as compared to net income available to common shareholders of billion in included in the net loss is approximately billion of charges related to purchase accounting for the obs acquisition  including a billion acquired in process research and development charge 
cash flow provided by operating activities was billion in global sales of schering plough s cholesterol franchise products  vytorin and zetia  made by the cholesterol joint venture with merck company  inc merck continued to grow in and contributed significantly to schering plough s improved operating results and cash flow see note below about developments 
in addition  increased sales of pharmaceutical products such as remicade  temodar and nasonex also contributed favorably to schering plough s overall operating results and cash flow 
the additional strength that schering plough developed  in and during the four years since mr 
hassan and the new management team began the action agenda  is key for schering plough in the current environment 
the pharmaceutical industry continues to be subject to ever more critical scrutiny  where events can be mischaracterized and drive amplified reactions 
schering plough believes that new scientific data are best presented and discussed at appropriate scientific and medical forums 
early developments relating to the cholesterol franchise as explained in more detail in part i  item  legal proceedings  enhance matter  in early  schering plough encountered such a challenge when results of a merck schering plough cholesterol joint venture clinical trial  called enhance  and joint venture products zetia and vytorin  became the subject of much media scrutiny prior to fuller discussions of the trial results at appropriate medical forums 
a discussion is scheduled for the american college of cardiology meeting on march  medical experts and health advisory groups have long recognized high ldl cholesterol often known as bad cholesterol as a significant cardiovascular risk factor and recommended increasingly aggressive treatment of high cholesterol for certain patients 
lowering ldl cholesterol  along with a healthy diet and lifestyle changes  remains the cornerstone of lipid treatment for patients at risk for heart disease 
clinical studies  including enhance  have demonstrated that vytorin lowers patients ldl cholesterol more than rosuvastatin  atorvastatin and simvastatin at the doses studied and was able to get more patients to their ldl cholesterol goals as defined by atp iii 
while it is too early to tell the impact of the joint venture s enhance trial results on the joint ventures cholesterol business  schering plough s diversified group of products and geographic areas  as well as its highly experienced executive team  gives schering plough additional strength that will be helpful in weathering this situation 
strategic alliances as is typical in the pharmaceutical industry  schering plough licenses manufacturing  marketing and or distribution rights to certain products to others  and also manufactures  markets and or distributes products 
table of contents owned by others pursuant to licensing and joint venture arrangements 
any time that third parties are involved  there are additional factors relating to the third party and outside the control of schering plough that may create positive or negative impacts on schering plough 
vytorin  zetia and remicade are subject to such arrangements and are key to schering plough s current business and financial performance 
in addition  any potential strategic alternatives may be impacted by the change of control provisions in those arrangements  which could result in vytorin and zetia being acquired by merck or remicade reverting back to centocor 
the change in control provision relating to vytorin and zetia is included in the contract with merck  filed as exhibit r to schering plough s k  and the change of control provision relating to remicade is contained in the contract with centocor  filed as exhibit v to schering plough s k 
cholesterol franchise schering plough s cholesterol franchise products  vytorin and zetia  are managed through a joint venture between schering plough and merck for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels in all markets outside of japan 
zetia is schering plough s novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor 
vytorin is the combination of zetia and zocor simvastatin  a statin medication developed by merck 
the financial commitment to compete in the cholesterol reduction market is shared with merck  and profits from the sales of vytorin and zetia are also shared with merck 
the operating results of the joint venture with merck are recorded using the equity method of accounting 
the cholesterol reduction market is the single largest pharmaceutical category in the world 
vytorin and zetia are competing in this market  and on a combined basis  these products continued to grow in terms of sales and market share during see note above about developments 
a material change in the sales or market share of schering plough s cholesterol franchise would have a significant impact on schering plough s consolidated results of operations and cash flows 
in order to maintain and enhance its infrastructure and business  schering plough must continue to increase profits 
this increased profitability is largely dependent upon the performance of schering plough s cholesterol franchise 
japan is not included in the joint venture with merck 
in the japanese market  bayer healthcare is co marketing schering plough s cholesterol absorption inhibitor  zetia  which was approved in japan in april as a monotherapy and co administered with a statin for use in patients with hypercholesterolemia  familial hypercholesterolemia or homozygous sitosterolemia 
zetia was launched in japan during june schering plough s sales of zetia in japan under the co marketing agreement with bayer healthcare are recognized in net sales 
license arrangements with centocor remicade is prescribed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  early rheumatoid arthritis  psoriatic arthritis  crohn s disease  ankylosing spondylitis  plaque psoriasis and ulcerative colitis 
remicade is schering plough s second largest marketed pharmaceutical product line after the cholesterol franchise 
remicade is licensed from and manufactured by centocor  inc  a johnson johnson company 
during  schering plough exercised an option under its contract with centocor for license rights to develop and commercialize golimumab  a fully human monoclonal antibody currently in phase iii trials 
schering plough has exclusive marketing rights to both products outside of the us  japan and certain asian markets 
in december  schering plough and centocor revised their distribution agreement regarding the development  commercialization and distribution of both remicade and golimumab  extending schering plough s rights to exclusively market remicade to match the duration of schering plough s exclusive marketing rights for golimumab 
effective upon regulatory approval of golimumab in the eu  schering plough s marketing rights for both products will now extend for years after the first commercial sale of golimumab within the eu 
centocor will receive a progressively increased share of profits on schering plough s distribution of both products in the schering plough marketing territory between and  and the share of profits will remain fixed thereafter for the remainder of the term 
the changes to the duration of remicade marketing rights and the profit sharing arrangement for the products are all conditioned on approval of golimumab being granted prior to september  schering plough may independently develop 
table of contents and market golimumab for a crohn s disease indication in its territories  with an option for centocor to participate 
in addition  schering plough and centocor agreed to utilize an autoinjector device in the commercialization of golimumab and further agreed to share its development costs 
for the rights to this device  schering plough made an upfront payment of million  which is included in research and development expenses for the year ended december  manufacturing  sales and marketing schering plough supports commercialized products with manufacturing  sales and marketing efforts 
schering plough is also moving forward with additional investments to enhance its infrastructure and business  including capital expenditures for the drug development process where products are moved from the drug discovery pipeline to markets  information technology systems  and post marketing studies and monitoring 
schering plough continually reviews the business  including manufacturing operations  to identify actions that will enhance long term competitiveness 
however  schering plough s manufacturing cost base is relatively fixed  and actions to significantly reduce schering plough s manufacturing infrastructure  including obs manufacturing operations acquired during  involve complex issues 
as a result  shifting products between manufacturing plants can take many years due to construction and regulatory requirements  including revalidation and registration requirements 
from time to time  actions are taken to enhance schering plough s overall manufacturing efficiency 
for example  during  schering plough closed a manufacturing plant in puerto rico and in began the process of closing a small manufacturing facility in the asia pacific region 
schering plough continues to review the carrying value of manufacturing assets for indications of impairment 
future events and decisions may lead to additional asset impairments or related costs 
regulatory and competitive environment schering plough is subject to the jurisdiction of various national  state and local regulatory agencies 
regulatory compliance is complex and costly  impacting the timing needed to bring new drugs to market and to market drugs for new indications 
schering plough engages in clinical trial research in many countries around the world 
research activities must comply with stringent regulatory standards and are subject to inspection by us  the eu  and local country regulatory authorities 
schering plough is subject to pharmacovigilance reporting requirements in many countries and other jurisdictions  including the us  the eu  and the eu member states 
clinical trials and post marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of competitors within the industry have raised safety concerns that have led to recalls  withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products 
a number of intermediaries are involved between drug manufacturers  such as schering plough  and patients who use the drugs 
these intermediaries impact the patient s ability  and their precribers s ability  to choose and pay for a particular drug 
these intermediaries include health care providers  such as hospitals and clinics  payors and their representatives  such as employers  insurers  managed care organizations and governments  and others in the supply chain  such as pharmacists and wholesalers 
further  in the us  many of schering plough s pharmaceutical products are subject to increasingly competitive pricing as certain of the intermediaries including managed care groups  institutions and government agencies seek price discounts 
in most international markets  schering plough operates in an environment of government mandated cost containment programs 
also  the pricing  sales and marketing programs and arrangements  and related business practices of schering plough and other participants in the health care industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory  investigative  prosecutorial and administrative entities 
the market for pharmaceutical products is competitive 
schering plough s operations may be affected by technological advances of competitors  industry consolidation  patents granted to competitors  loss of patent protection due to challenges by competitors  competitive combination products  new products of competitors  new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post marketing surveillance and generic competition as schering plough s products mature 

table of contents obs acquisition on november   schering plough acquired obs for a purchase price of approximately euro billion in cash  or approximately billion 
commencing from the acquisition date  obs assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as the results of obs operations  are included in schering plough s consolidated financial statements 
there were approximately one and one half months of results of operations relating to obs included in schering plough s statement of consolidated operations for the year ended december  the impact of purchase accounting  based on a preliminary valuation  resulted in the following non cash charges in acquired in process research and development ipr d  which was a one time charge of approximately billion 
amortization of inventory adjusted to fair value  of which approximately billion will be charged to cost of sales million in approximately over a one year period from the acquisition date 
amortization of acquired intangible assets adjusted to fair value  of which billion will be amortized over a weighted average life of years to cost of sales million in 
incremental depreciation relating to the adjustment in fair value on property  plant and equipment of million that will be depreciated primarily to cost of sales over the lives of the applicable property million in 
the billion acquired ipr d charge was associated with research projects in the women s health  central nervous system and anesthesia therapeutic areas of human health as well as research projects in animal health 
the amount was determined by using discounted cash flow projections of identified research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and for which there was no alternative future use 
the discount rates used ranged from percent to percent 
the projected launch dates following fda or other regulatory approval are years through  at which time schering plough expects these projects to begin to generate cash flows 
all of the research and development projects considered in the valuation are subject to the normal risks and uncertainties associated with demonstrating the safety and efficacy required to obtain fda or other regulatory approvals 
discussion of operating results the results of operations in discussed below include obs product sales and expenses as well as certain non cash charges relating to purchase accounting associated with the obs acquisition 
net sales a significant portion of net sales is made to major pharmaceutical and health care product distributors and major retail chains in the us consequently  net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors  retail chains and other trade buyers 
these fluctuations may result from seasonality  pricing  wholesaler  retail and trade buying decisions  changes in overall demand factors or other factors 
in addition to these fluctuations  sales of many pharmaceutical products in the us are subject to increased pricing pressure from managed care groups  institutions  government agencies  and other groups seeking discounts 
schering plough and other pharmaceutical manufacturers in the us market are also required to provide statutorily defined rebates to various government agencies in order to participate in the medicaid program  the veterans health care program  and other government funded programs 
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of contains a prescription drug benefit for individuals who are eligible for medicare 
this prescription drug benefit became effective on january  and is resulting in increased use of generics and increased purchasing power of those negotiating on behalf of medicare recipients 
in most international markets  schering plough operates in an environment where governments may and have mandated cost containment
