item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of outsourced services to small and mid sized public agencies in california and other western states 
outsourcing enables these agencies to provide a wide range of specialized services  without having to incur and maintain the overhead necessary to develop staffing in house 
we provide a broad range of services to public agencies  including civil engineering  building and safety services  geotechnical engineering  financial and economic consulting  and disaster preparedness and homeland security 
we operate our business through a network of over offices located throughout california and other western states and had a staff of as of december  that includes licensed engineers and other professionals 
we ranked out of top design firms in engineering news record s design survey 
our core clients are public agencies in communities with populations ranging from  to  people 
we believe communities of this size are underserved by large outsourcing companies that tend to focus on securing large federal and state projects  as well as projects for the private sector 
we seek to establish close working relationships with our public agency clients and  over time  to expand the breadth and depth of the services we provide to them 
while we currently serve communities throughout the country  our business is concentrated in california and neighboring states 
we provide services to approximately of the cities and over of the counties in california 
we also serve special districts  school districts and other public agencies 
willdan group  inc is a delaware corporation formed in for the purposes of effecting the reincorporation of the willdan group of companies  a california corporation  formed in to serve as our holding company 
the reincorporation was completed effective june  prior to our initial public offering in november  we were taxed as an s corporation for purposes of federal and state income taxes 
as a result of the offering  our s corporation status terminated and we are now taxed as a c corporation under federal and state tax laws 
in fiscal year  we recognized a net deferred income tax liability of million resulting from the termination of our s corporation status 
we were founded over years ago  and today consist of a family of wholly owned companies that operate within the following segments for financial reporting purposes engineering services 
our engineering services segment includes the businesses of our subsidiary  willdan  which provides engineering related services  and our subsidiary  arroyo geotechnical  which provides geotechnical engineering services 
the segment also includes our subsidiaries  public agency resources pars  which primarily provides staffing to willdan  and willdan resource solutions  which provides environmental engineering and environmental related services to public and private sector clients 
willdan is our largest subsidiary and currently represents our core business 
contract revenue for the engineering services segment represented and of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
public finance services 
our public finance services segment consists of the business of our subsidiary  munifinancial  which offers financial and economic services to public agencies 
contract revenue for the public finance services segment represented and of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
homeland security services 
our homeland security services segment consists of the business of our subsidiary  american homeland solutions  which offers homeland security and public safety consulting services 
we formed this subsidiary in fiscal year and began operations in the second half of fiscal year contract revenue for our homeland security services segment represented and of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
recent developments litigation in the third quarter of  we obtained a court ruling awarding us approximately million on a claim for indemnity  recovering the settlement amount and interest thereon and attorney fees and costs in connection with a claim that arose in fiscal year this ruling was appealed by the cross defendant and the ruling was overturned in february because the claim arose in and our insurance carrier previously paid the settlement amount  we were able to replenish our insurance coverage by approximately million for that policy year 
therefore  in the third quarter of we reflected a receivable from our insurance company of approximately million 
given that the ruling was overturned  we reversed the receivable and reflected the expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal year components of income and expense contract revenue we enter into contracts with our clients that contain three principal types of pricing provisions fixed fee  time and materials and unit based 
contract revenue on our fixed fee contracts is determined on the percentage of completion method based generally on the ratio of direct costs incurred to date to estimated total direct costs at completion 
many of our fixed fee contracts are relatively short in duration  thereby lowering the risks of not properly estimating the percent complete 
revenue on our time and materials and unit based contracts are recognized as the work is performed in accordance with specific terms of the contract 
a large percentage of our contracts are based on contractual rates per hour plus costs incurred 
some of these contracts include maximum contract prices  but the majority of these contracts are not expected to exceed the maximum 
adjustments to contract cost estimates are made in the periods in which the facts requiring such revisions become known 
when the revised estimate indicates a loss  such loss is provided for currently in its entirety 
claims revenue is recognized only upon resolution of the claim 
change orders in dispute are evaluated as claims 
costs related to unpriced change orders are expensed when incurred and recognition of the related contract revenue is based on an evaluation of the probability of recovery of the costs 
estimated profit is recognized for unpriced change orders if realization of the expected price of the change order is assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
direct costs of contract revenue direct costs of contract revenue consist primarily of that portion of technical and nontechnical salaries and wages that has been incurred in connection with revenue producing projects 
direct costs of contract revenue also include production expenses  subconsultant services and other expenses that are incurred in connection with revenue producing projects 
direct costs of contract revenue exclude that portion of technical and nontechnical salaries and wages related to marketing efforts  vacations  holidays and other time not spent directly generating revenue under existing contracts 
such costs are included in general and administrative expenses 
additionally  payroll taxes  bonuses and employee benefit costs for all of our personnel are included in general and administrative expenses since no allocation of these costs is made to direct costs of contract revenue 
no allocation of facilities costs is made to direct costs of contract revenue nor is depreciation and amortization allocated to direct costs 
we expense direct costs of contract revenue when incurred 
as a firm that provides multiple and diverse outsource services  we do not believe gross margin is a consistent or appropriate indicator of our performance and therefore we do not use this measure as construction contractors and other types of consulting firms may 
other companies may classify as direct costs of contract revenue some of the costs that we classify as general and administrative expenses 
as a result  our direct costs of contract revenue may not be comparable to direct costs for other companies  either as a line item expense or as a percentage of contract revenue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include the costs of the marketing and support staffs  other marketing expenses  management and administrative personnel costs  payroll taxes  bonuses and employee benefits for all of our employees and the portion of salaries and wages not allocated to direct costs of contract revenue for those employees who provide our services 
general and administrative expenses also include facility costs  depreciation and amortization  professional services  legal and accounting fees and administrative operating costs 
within general and administrative expenses  other includes expenses such as professional services  legal and accounting  computer costs  travel and entertainment and marketing costs 
we expense general and administrative costs when incurred 
until november  we had not operated as a public company 
as a public company  we have and will continue to incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company  and we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as a result 
our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with the requirements of being a public company 
moreover  rules and regulations for public companies have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and has made some activities more time consuming and costly 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or gaap 
to prepare these financial statements in conformity with gaap  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date of this report 
contract accounting applying the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenue requires us to estimate the indicated outcome of our long term contracts 
we forecast such outcomes to the best of our knowledge and belief of current and expected conditions and our expected course of action 
differences between our estimates and actual results often occur resulting in changes to reported revenue and earnings 
such changes could have a material effect on our future consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful accounts based upon our review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts 
our credit risk is minimal with governmental entities 
account receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received 
for further information on the types of contracts under which we perform our services  see business contract structure elsewhere in this report 
goodwill impairment valuation goodwill primarily represents the excess of the purchase price paid for our pubic finance services reporting unit over the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
to estimate the fair value  we use a valuation approach based on a multiple of historical cash flows  management s estimates of future cash flows  and other market data 
this estimate of fair value is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions that could differ materially from actual results 
if our evaluation indicates that goodwill is impaired  we perform an additional assessment to determine the extent of the impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
we did not recognize any impairment charges in fiscal years  and accounting for claims against the company we record liabilities to claimants for probable and estimable claims on our consolidated balance sheet  which is included in accrued liabilities  and record a corresponding receivable from our insurance company for the portion of the claim that is probable of being covered by insurance  which is included in other receivables 
the estimated claim amount net of the amount estimated to be recoverable from the insurance company is included in our general and administrative expenses 
determining probability and estimating claim amounts is highly judgmental 
initial accruals and any subsequent changes in our estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of contract revenue

our contract revenue was million for fiscal year ended december   with million attributable to the engineering services segment and million attributable to the public finance services segment 
our homeland security services segment generated million during this period 
consolidated contract revenue increased million  or  from million in the fiscal year ended december  this increase was due primarily to an increase of million  or  and million  or  in contract revenue of the public finance services and homeland security services segments  respectively  offset by a decrease of million  or  in contract revenue of the engineering services segment 
revenue in the public finance services segment increased primarily due to increased district formation services to fund infrastructure projects as well as increased delinquency management services in our district administration services 
revenue in homeland security services has increased due to an increase in our emergency response training courses  particularly in southern california 
our engineering services segment decline was due in part to the slowdown in residential housing construction in the western united states 
a source of revenue in our engineering services segment is fees assessed for building permits 
in the latter part of fiscal year and throughout fiscal year  we experienced a reduction in revenue from these fees because of the downturn in the housing market 
direct costs of contract revenue 
direct costs of contract revenue was million for the fiscal year ended december   with million attributable to the engineering services segment and million attributable to the public finance services segment 
the additional million is attributable to direct costs of contract revenue for our homeland security services segment 
direct costs of contract revenue increased million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended december  of this total increase  direct costs of contract revenue increased million  or  in the engineering services segment and million  or  in the public finance services segment 
the remaining million increase was attributable to the homeland security services segment 
direct costs of contract revenue as a percentage of contract revenue for the fiscal year ended december  increased to from for the fiscal year ended december   primarily because our direct costs of contract revenue increased without a corresponding increase in our revenue 
this is due in part to higher levels of non salaries and wages cost which are passed through to clients at a lower mark up than salaries and wages 
within direct costs of contract revenue  salaries and wages increased to of contract revenue for the fiscal year ended december  from for the fiscal year ended december  comparing those same periods  subconsultant services increased to of contract revenue from of contract revenue 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  this was due primarily to increases of million and million in general and administrative expenses of the engineering services and homeland security services segments  respectively 
general and administrative expenses for the public finance services segment and unallocated corporate expenses remained flat 
the engineering services segment increase includes a million change in our litigation accrual as a result of the million charge in fiscal year for reversal of the million recovery of a prior indemnity claim recorded during fiscal year the litigation accrual is discussed above in recent developments litigation 
also included in our general and administrative expenses are the costs associated with management changes in the fiscal year ended december  these costs resulted in an increase of approximately million in expenses for the payment of severance and other employee benefits 
overall  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenue increased to in the fiscal year ended december  from in the fiscal year ended december  the increases in general and administrative expenses also resulted from i an increase of approximately million  or  in other general and administrative expenses  which includes million of legal fees related to the settlement of the west hollywood litigation and ii an increase of million related to increased costs associated with being a public company  of which million related to costs associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the balance includes additional audit and legal fees and board of director fees 
additionally  approximately million of the increase to other general and administrative expenses resulted from increased insurance premiums  computer expenses and other costs associated with our increase in contract revenue offset by decreases in marketing expenses  bad debt expenses and other expenses of approximately million 
as discussed above under components of income and expense direct costs of contract revenue  we do not allocate that portion of salaries and wages not related to time spent directly generating revenue to direct costs of contract revenue 
income from operations 
as a result of the above factors  income from operations was million for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to a million for the fiscal year ended december  income from operations as a percentage of contract revenue  decreased to in the fiscal year ended december  from in the prior year period 
other income expense 
other income expense  net  decreased by million  or  to million of income in the fiscal year ended december  from million of income in the fiscal ended december  this decrease was primarily due to million of life insurance proceeds received in as a result of the death of our former chief executive officer in may  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of approximately million primarily as a result of i the reversal of million of accrued interest payable associated with the west hollywood litigation settlement and ii an increase in interest income of approximately million from invested initial public offering proceeds 
income tax expense 
effective as of the first day of trading of our common stock  november   the s corporation status of our company and the qualified s subsidiary status of our subsidiaries terminated and thereafter we were subject to federal and state income taxes as a c corporation 
thus we were taxed at regular corporate rates during the fiscal year ended december  and the income tax expense for fiscal year and is not comparable 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year contract revenue 
our contract revenue was million for the fiscal year ended december   with million attributable to the engineering services segment and million attributable to the public finance services segment 
our homeland security services segment generated million during this period 
consolidated contract revenue increased million  or  from million in the fiscal year ended december  this was due primarily to increases of million  or  and million  or  in contract revenue of the engineering services and public finance services segments  respectively 
in addition  was the first fiscal year in which our homeland security services segment  which began operations in the second half of fiscal year  generated notable revenue 
contract revenue in the homeland security services segment increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year overall headcount increased to as of december  from as of december   an increase of the growth in contract revenue for the engineering services segment was due primarily to increased demand for our existing services 
to respond to this demand  our engineering services segment increased its total headcount to as of december  from as of december   representing an increase of 
to respond to demand for our services in additional geographic areas of california  we opened a new satellite office in santa rosa  california in may to respond to demand for our services in our existing geographic locations  in fiscal year  we relocated and or expanded our facilities in bakersfield  fresno  redding  and sacramento  california  as well as in phoenix and tucson  arizona and henderson  nevada 
in fiscal year  we opened two new satellite office locations in fresno and marysville  california 
the growth in contract revenue for our public finance services segment also was due primarily to increased demand for our existing services 
to respond to this demand  we opened two new munifinancial locations in june and september in bellevue  washington and orlando  florida 
our public finance services segment met this increased demand for services without increasing its total headcount 
total headcount was as of december  which represents no change from the total headcount as of december  to provide for demand for our homeland security services  we opened a separate location for these services in anaheim  california in march direct costs of contract revenue 
direct costs of contract revenue was million in the fiscal year ended december   with million attributable to the engineering services segment and million attributable to the public finance services segment 
the additional million is attributable to direct costs of contract revenue for our homeland security services segment 
this represented a total increase of million  or  from million in the fiscal year ended december  of this total increase  direct costs of contract revenue increased million  or  in the engineering services segment and there was no increase in the public finance services segment 
the remaining million is attributable to the homeland security services segment 
these increases were primarily the result of the increased volume of activity that generated the increased contract revenue previously discussed for our three operating segments 
direct costs of contract revenue as a percentage of contract revenue for the fiscal year ended december  decreased to from for the fiscal year ended december  within direct costs of contract revenue  salaries and wages increased from of contract revenue in the fiscal year ended december  to in the fiscal year ended december  comparing those same periods  subconsultant services decreased from of contract revenue to of contract revenue 
this shift within direct costs of contract revenue is primarily due to the establishment of our subsidiary  pars  in fiscal year pars provides in house staffing services to willdan by hiring professionals that would in the past have been engaged as subconsultants or independent contractors 
numerous subconsultants whom we previously engaged as independent contractors for projects within our engineering services segment became employees of pars 
all contract revenue and expenses associated with the operation of pars are included in the engineering services segment 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended december  from million in the fiscal year ended december  this was due primarily to increases of million and million in general and administrative expenses of the engineering services and public finance services segments  respectively  along with expenses of million related to the establishment of our homeland security services segment 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of million attributed to unallocated corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenue decreased to in the fiscal year ended december  from in the prior year period 
the increases in general and administrative expenses in the engineering services and public finance services segments were due primarily to increased costs related to the growth in headcount of engineers and other professionals 
additionally  the million increase in the engineering services segment is net of a million reduction in our litigation accrual as a result of the recovery of a prior indemnity claim  which reduction was subsequently reversed in the fourth quarter of employee related costs included in general and administrative expenses such as payroll taxes  employee benefits  bonuses and that portion of salaries and wages related to time not spent directly generating revenue increased by million  or 
facilities costs increased by million  or  as a result of additional needs created by the increased headcount 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  as a result of additional needs for leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment created by additional personnel 
other general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or 
this includes an increase of million for bad debt expense related to an engineering services segment project  an increase of million in marketing expense primarily due to design and printing costs related to our name change in june  an increase of million in insurance premiums and an increase in million in computer expense related to increases in employee headcount  and expenses related to our initial public offering 
as discussed above under components of income and expense direct costs of contract revenue  we do not allocate the costs discussed above to direct costs of contract revenue 
the million decrease in unallocated corporate expense is primarily the result of a decrease of million in stock based compensation expense in compared to stock based compensation expense in anticipation of the initial public offering of million was recorded in the fiscal year ended december  in connection with stock issuances during that period 
income loss from operations 
as a result of the above factors  income from operations was million for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to a million loss from operations for the fiscal year ended december  income from operations as a percentage of contract revenue  increased to in the fiscal year ended december  from in the prior year period 
as discussed above  income from operations for the fiscal year ended december  includes a reduction in litigation accrual of million as a result of the recovery in on a prior claim  which reduction was subsequently reversed in the fourth quarter of  and a decrease from fiscal year of million in stock based compensation expense 
other income expense 
other income expense  net increased by million to million of income in the fiscal year ended december  from million of expense in the fiscal year ended december  this was due primarily to the receipt of million in life insurance proceeds as a result of the death of our former chief executive officer and the recovery of  on legal matters  partially offset by increased interest expense of million 
interest expense increased due to million accrued during fiscal year related to the west hollywood litigation and this increase was partially offset by decreased interest as a result of lower outstanding principal balances on our debt 
income tax expense 
in fiscal year  income tax expense increased by million to million from  in fiscal year this increase was due primarily to an increase of million to record our deferred tax liability at c corporation federal and state tax rates that resulted from the termination of our s corporation status upon completion of our initial public offering 
to a lesser extent  the increase in income tax expense relates to calculating the expense for the post ipo period using c corporation tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash generated by operating activities and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operating activities for at least the next months 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows used in operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year the cash flows used in operating activities in the fiscal year ended december  were comparatively higher than in fiscal year due primarily to the payment of accrued liabilities related to the west hollywood litigation net of amounts paid for by our insurance company along with payment of increased general and administrative costs 
in the period  net cash provided by operating activities included million of life insurance proceeds received as a result of the death of our former chief executive officer in may cash flows from investing activities cash flows used in investing activities were million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year the decrease of cash used in investing activities for fiscal year over fiscal year resulted primarily from the decrease in expenditures for equipment and leasehold improvements 
this decrease was offset by an increase of million in the net purchase of temporary liquid investments with the proceeds from our initial public offering in november fiscal years and included higher than historical levels of equipment and leasehold improvements purchases due to the establishment of new office locations and the relocation of existing office facilities  including our corporate offices 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows used in financing activities were million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of million for the fiscal year ended december  and million for fiscal the net change between fiscal years and for cash from financing activities is million  which is primarily the result of net proceeds of million received in fiscal from the sale of stock in our initial public offering and the exercise of the overallotment option  partially offset by a decrease of million in distributions paid to holders of our redeemable common stock 
the fiscal year distribution was our final s corporation distribution to our stockholders and we used the proceeds from our initial public offering to pay this amount 
we will not make a similar distribution in the future because we can no longer elect to be treated as an s corporation 
cash flows provided by financing activities for the fiscal year increased from fiscal year primarily as a result of an increase in net proceeds from issuance of common stock of million as a result of our initial public offering and the exercise of the over allotment option and a decrease in net debt repayments of million  partially offset by an increase in the distributions to holders of redeemable common stock of million 
outstanding indebtedness we currently have a revolving line of credit with a bank 
we also finance insurance premiums by entering into unsecured notes payable with insurance companies 
under the terms of the credit agreement  we can borrow up to million from time to time up to and until january  loans made under the revolving line of credit will accrue interest at either i the floating rate of below the prime rate in effect from time to time or ii the fixed rate of above libor  at our election 
for prime rate loans  the interest rate will be adjusted when each prime rate change by the bank is announced and becomes effective 
the interest rate is subject to adjustment based on changes in our ratio of total funded debt to ebitda as defined in the credit agreement 
upon a default  the interest rate will be increased by a default rate margin of 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit agreement  the bank has the option to make all indebtedness then owed by us under the credit agreement immediately due and payable 
the revolving line of credit matures on january  borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by all accounts receivable and other rights to payment  general intangibles  inventory and equipment including those of our subsidiaries 
each subsidiary except public agency resources has signed an unconditional guaranty of our obligations under the agreements 
the credit agreement also contains customary representations and affirmative covenants  including covenants to maintain a minimum tangible net worth  a minimum net income  a minimum asset coverage ratio and a maximum ratio of total funded debt to ebitda each ratio as specifically defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also includes customary negative covenants  including a covenant that prohibits the incurrence of additional indebtedness by us or our subsidiaries other than purchase money indebtedness not to exceed million and indebtedness existing on the date of the credit agreement  and a covenant that prohibits payment of dividends on our stock 
in addition  the credit agreement includes customary defaults for a credit facility 
there were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement as of december  we terminated our prior business loan agreement  promissory note and commercial security agreement with orange county business bank  or ocbb  on december  we terminated the loan agreement with ocbb in connection with the entering into of our new revolving credit facility described above 
we paid no fees or penalties as a result of terminating the our loan agreement with ocbb 
in connection with the june acquisition of the assets of an entity that developed and delivered training courses  we entered into a  note payable to the seller for a portion of the purchase price 
the seller was hired as an employee in connection with this acquisition 
this related party note bore interest at and was repaid during fiscal year contractual obligations we have certain cash obligations and other commitments which will impact our short and long term liquidity 
at december   such obligations and commitments consisted of long term debt  operating leases and capital leases 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt   operating leases    capital leases     total contractual cash obligations   long term debt includes principal and interest payments under our debt agreements assuming no additional borrowings or principal payments 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of fasb statement of financial accounting stands sfas no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas does not prescribe a recognition threshold or measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return 
diversity in practice existed in the accounting for income taxes 
to address that diversity  fin clarifies the application of sfas by defining a criterion that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
additionally  fin provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we adopted the provisions of sfas effective as of the beginning of fiscal year we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes 
market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including long term debt 
as a result of our initial public offering  we had cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  of this amount  million was invested in the orange county business bank money market fund and million was invested in cash in the lehman brothers national muni money fund reserve class 
although these investments are subject to variable interest rates  we do not believe we are subject to significant market risk for these short term investments 
we do not engage in trading activities and do not participate in foreign currency transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments 
additionally  as of december   we did not have any outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility that bears interest at variable or fixed rates
