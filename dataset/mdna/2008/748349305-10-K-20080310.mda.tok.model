overview of the year ended december  our strategic positioning in the southeastern kansas and northeastern oklahoma natural gas industry has contributed to increases in total revenues and has resulted in a solid foundation for future growth 
the increase in total revenues in as compared to resulted from an approximate increase in production volumes and an approximate increase in natural gas prices  including hedges 
at december   we had an interest in  natural gas and oil wells gross and natural gas and oil leases on approximately  gross acres  located in the cherokee basin 
management believes that the proximity of the  miles of quest midstream owned gas gathering pipeline network to these natural gas and oil leases will enable us to develop new producing wells on many of our undeveloped properties 
we have currently identified approximately  additional gross natural gas well drilling sites on our undeveloped acreage  of which are classified as proved undeveloped 
with approximately wells planned to be drilled during each of and  we are positioned for significant growth in natural gas production  revenues  and net income 
however  no 
table of contents assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve our anticipated rate of growth or that adequate sources of capital will be available 
the results of our drilling and well development program for calendar year included the drilling of new gas wells gross  the connecting of new gas wells gross into our gas gathering pipeline network  the construction of approximately miles of natural gas gathering pipeline  the purchase of approximately  miles of interstate natural gas transmission pipeline and the recompletion of wells from single seam to multi seam wells

liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operations  amounts available under our revolving credit facilities and funds from future private and public equity and debt offerings 
please read note long term debt to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding our credit facilities  including a description of the financial covenants contained in each of the credit facilities 
at december   we had million of availability under our revolving credit facility  which was available for general corporate purposes 
at december   quest energy had million of availability under its revolving credit facility  which was available to fund the drilling and completion of additional gas wells  the recompletion of single seam wells into 
table of contents multi seam wells  the acquisition of additional acreage  equipment and vehicle replacement and purchases and the construction of salt water disposal facilities 
at december   quest midstream had million of availability under its revolving credit facility  which was available to fund additional pipeline construction and related facilities  the connection of additional wells to our pipeline system  pipeline acquisitions and working capital for our pipeline operations 
at december   we had current assets of million 
our working capital current assets minus current liabilities  excluding the short term derivative asset and liability of million and million  respectively was million at december   compared to working capital excluding the short term derivative asset and liability of million and million  respectively of million at december  the change in working capital is due to the formation of quest energy in november and the issuance of common units in quest midstream to a group of investors for approximately million before expenses 
additionally  inventory  accounts payable and accrued expenses balances increased as we expanded our operations 
a substantial portion of our production is hedged 
we are generally required to settle our commodity hedges on either the th or th day of each month 
as is typical in the gas and oil business  we generally do not receive the proceeds from the sale of the hedged production until around the th day of the following month 
as a result  when gas and oil prices increase and are above the prices fixed in our derivative contracts  we will be required to pay the hedge counterparty the difference between the fixed price in the hedge and the market price before we receive the proceeds from the sale of the hedged production 
future capital expenditures during  we intend to focus on drilling and completing up to new wells in the cherokee basin 
management currently estimates that it will require for and capital investments of million to drill and complete these wells and recomplete an estimated gross wells in the cherokee basin  million for acreage  equipment and vehicle replacement and purchases and salt water disposal facilities in the cherokee basin  million for the pipeline expansion to connect the new wells to our existing gas gathering pipeline network in the cherokee basin  million for line looping and kpc activities  including the building of a processing plant  and million for exploration and production activities in areas outside of the cherokee basin 
our capital expenditures will consist of the following maintenance capital expenditures  which are those capital expenditures required to maintain our production levels and asset base and pipeline volumes over the long term  and expansion capital expenditures  which are those capital expenditures that we expect will increase our production of our gas and oil properties  our asset base or our pipeline volumes over the long term 
quest energy and quest midstream will be responsible for the cherokee basin capital expenditures described above 
quest midstream will be responsible for the kpc expenditures described above 
in general  quest energy and quest midstream intend to finance future maintenance capital expenditures generally from cash flow from operations and expansion capital expenditures generally with borrowings under their credit facilities and or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
we will be responsible for the capital expenditures outside the cherokee basin described above 
quest resource intend to finance these capital expenditures through either borrowings under its revolving credit facility  the issuance of debt or equity securities and or distributions from quest energy and or quest midstream 
following the closing of the pinnacle merger  the combined company will have significantly more development opportunities than we currently have by ourselves  which will require significantly greater capital 
table of contents expenditures in order to fully develop our properties 
it is currently anticipated that after the payment of merger related expenses  we will have little or no availability under our current credit facility for development of the pinnacle properties 
quest energy and quest midstream have significant availability under their credit facilities  but those credit facilities will only be available to fund the development of those pinnacle properties  if any  that are contributed to the partnerships 
we currently intend to either obtain an increase in the commitments under our existing credit facility or obtain a new credit facility with a higher borrowing base 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully increase our commitments or enter into a new credit facility 
even if we are able to successfully increase the commitments under our credit facilities  we anticipate that cash available under our credit facilities  together with cash flow expected to be generated from operations and distributions from quest midstream and quest energy will only be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the development of pinnacle s reserves for a period less than months 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to the pinnacle merger to develop our current reserves and the reserves acquired from pinnacle  we will require significant additional capital 
in the event we make one or more additional acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount we have available for acquisitions at that time  we would reduce the expected level of capital expenditures and or seek additional capital 
if we seek additional capital for that or other reasons  we may do so through traditional reserve base borrowings  joint venture partnerships  production payment financings  asset sales  offerings of debt or equity securities or other means 
we cannot assure you that needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to raise funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness will be limited by covenants in our credit facility and the credit facilities of quest midstream and quest energy 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms  we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves and maintain our pipeline volumes 
please read note long term debt to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of the financial covenants contained in each of the credit facilities 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms  we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves 
cash flows cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided by operations of million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from a change in derivative fair value  an increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable and an increase in revenue payable and other receivables 
cash flows used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   a total of approximately million of capital expenditures was invested as follows million was invested in new natural gas wells and properties  million in new pipeline facilities including kpc pipeline  million in acquiring leasehold and million in other additional capital items 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided from financing activities was primarily due to an increase in bank borrowings of million and an increase of million from the sale of quest energy common units  partially offset by an increase in repayments of note borrowings of million  a decrease of million from the sale of quest midstream partnership interests  an increase of million in distributions to unitholders  and an increase of million in financing related costs 
other long term indebtedness at december    of notes payable to banks and finance companies were outstanding and are secured by equipment and vehicles  with payments due in monthly installments through october with interest ranging from to per annum

critical accounting policies and estimates readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the two policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below 
the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
the sensitivity analyses used below are not intended to provide a reader with our predictions of the variability of the estimates used 
rather  the sensitivities used are included to allow the reader to understand a general cause and effect of changes in estimates 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities we use commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in gas and oil and changes in interest rates 
recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction 
results of gas and oil derivative transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales  and results of interest rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense 
the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the statement of operations as unrealized gains losses within oil and gas sales or interest expense 
cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the same category within the statement of cash flows as the items being hedged  or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in the fair 
table of contents value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas  is recognized immediately in oil and gas sales 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas  changes in fair value  as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized currently in earnings 
differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument  if any  represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings 
one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently confirmed the fair values internally using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of gas and oil prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  our financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december  and and december   the net market value of our derivatives was a liability of million  an asset of million and a liability of million  respectively 
with respect to our derivative contracts relating to periods after december   an increase or decrease in natural gas prices of per mmbtu would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts by approximately million 
gas and oil properties the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the gas and oil industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we follow the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of gas and oil properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of gas and oil properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher gas and oil depreciation  depletion and amortization rate  and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have 
under the full cost method  capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved gas and oil reserves 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense is also based on the amount of estimated reserves 
if we maintain the same level of production year over year  the depreciation  depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly 
proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of 
table of contents unproved properties  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties  and otherwise if impairment has occurred 
unevaluated properties are assessed individually when individual costs are significant 
we review the carrying value of our gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the sec on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test 
under the ceiling test  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues adjusted for cash flow hedges less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
in calculating future net revenues  current prices and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period 
such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts  including the effects of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges 
two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices  and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
revisions to estimates of gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
any excess of the net book value  less deferred income taxes  is generally written off as an expense 
under sec regulations  the excess above the ceiling is not expensed or is reduced if  subsequent to the end of the period  but prior to the release of the financial statements  gas and oil prices increase sufficiently such that an excess above the ceiling would have been eliminated or reduced if the increased prices were used in the calculations 
the process of estimating gas and oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates 
as of december   approximately of our proved reserves were evaluated by independent petroleum engineers 
all reserve estimates are prepared based upon a review of production histories and other geologic  economic  ownership and engineering data 
in addition  the prices of gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period 
price changes directly impact the estimated revenues from our properties and the associated present value of future net revenues 
such changes also impact the economic life of our properties and thereby affect the quantity of reserves that can be assigned to a property 
for example  if gas prices at december  had been less per mcf  then the standardized measure of our proved reserves as of december  would have decreased by million  from million to million and our proved reserves would have decreased by bcfe from bcfe to bcfe 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as derivative instruments  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and our net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists a the more positive evidence is necessary and b the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
if a natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels and if such decreases were considered other than temporary  b exploration  drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels  or c we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our nol carryforwards prior to their expiration  we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of million all of which is subject to an offsetting evaluation allowance of an equal amount 
fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 provides guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements 
guidance is also provided regarding de recognition  classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions 
based on this guidance  we regularly analyze tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based on the threshold condition prescribed under fin tax positions that do not meet or exceed this threshold condition are considered uncertain tax positions 
we accrue interest related to these uncertain tax positions which is recognized in interest expense 
penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded in other expenses 
additional information about uncertain tax positions appears in income taxes item business 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such activities
