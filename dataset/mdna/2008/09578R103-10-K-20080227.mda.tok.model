item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the heading item a 
risk factors 
management overview about blue nile we were incorporated in and have become a leading online retailer of diamonds and fine jewelry that offers an exceptional customer experience including substantial education  guidance and value 
we have successfully built blue nile into a premium brand 
our financial focus is primarily on long term  sustainable growth in free cash flow 
non gaap free cash flow is primarily driven by increasing our operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures 
increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites  improvements in operating margins and the efficient management of operating costs  offset by the investments that we make in longer term strategic initiatives 
differentiating factors and value proposition we have built an innovative business model that delivers exceptional value and service to customers 
we have developed relationships with a large number of independent vendors with whom we have exclusive agreements as an online retailer 
our unique inventory model allows us to offer our customers access to an enormous selection of high quality diamonds 
in most cases  we purchase diamonds from our suppliers only when a customer has ordered them from us 
as a result  we do not incur the significant costs typically associated with carrying high levels of diamond inventory in physical retail 
as an online retailer  we do not incur most of the operating costs associated with physical retail stores  including occupancy costs and related overhead 
as a result  while our gross profit margins are lower than those typically maintained by traditional diamond and fine jewelry retailers  we are able to realize relatively higher operating income as a percentage of net sales 
in the year ended december   we had a gross profit margin  as compared to what we believe to be gross profit margins of up to or more by some traditional retailers 
our lower gross profit margins result from lower retail prices that we offer to our customers 
we believe these lower prices  in turn  contribute to increased net sales 
our efficient operating model provides for negative working capital benefits 
payments are received from customers within a few days of their orders  but our vendor payment terms are typically in the day range 
we have an obsessive focus on the customer 
we develop our websites to offer easy to understand  step by step guides to visualizing  evaluating  selecting and purchasing diamonds and fine jewelry 
our customer support centers are staffed with non commissioned product experts who offer advice and guidance to blue nile defines free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  as net cash provided by used in operating activities less cash outflows for purchases of fixed assets  including internal use software and website development 

table of contents customers 
we continue to invest in optimizing our fulfillment operations to ensure that our customized products can be delivered within approximately three business days of order 
among the key non financial measures we review are customer feedback and customer satisfaction ratings 
we believe that maintaining high overall customer satisfaction is critical to our ongoing efforts to promote the blue nile brand and to increase our net sales and net income 
we actively solicit customer feedback on our website functionality as well as on the entire purchase experience 
to maintain a high level of performance by our diamond and jewelry consultants  we also undertake an ongoing customer feedback process 
seasonality we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in demand for our products 
our quarterly sales are impacted by various gift giving holidays including valentine s day first quarter  mother s day second quarter and christmas new year s fourth quarter 
as a result  our quarterly revenue is typically lowest in the third quarter as a result of the lack of recognized gift giving holidays and highest in the fourth quarter 
future growth opportunities a customer s first purchase from blue nile is often an engagement ring 
our goal is to provide an unrivaled customer experience such that we become our customers jeweler for life 
we have continued to expand our product lines to include non engagement diamond jewelry as well as other products such as pearls  gemstones and various silver  gold and platinum offerings 
our satisfied customers are also an important source of referrals that will help drive future growth 
we intend to selectively pursue opportunities in international markets in which we can leverage our existing infrastructure and compelling value proposition 
to date  we have launched sites offering local currency pricing in the united kingdom and canada 
we will prioritize and pursue future opportunities based on a number of factors  including but not limited to each market s consumer spending on jewelry  adoption rate of online purchasing and overall competitive landscape 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make certain estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following are the critical accounting policies that we believe require significant estimation and management judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue and the related gross profit on the date on which we estimate that customers have received their products 
as we require customer payment prior to order shipment  any payments received prior to the customer receipt date are not recorded as revenue 
we utilize our freight vendors tracking information to determine when delivery has occurred  which is typically within one to three days after shipment 
we reduce revenue by a provision for returns  which is based on our historical product return rates  trends and expectations 
our contracts with our suppliers generally allow us to return to our suppliers diamonds purchased and returned by our customers 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r 
we use the black scholes merton option valuation model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of employee stock options and 
table of contents consequently  the related amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company performed the following sensitivity analysis using changes in the expected term and volatility that could be reasonably possible in the near term 
if we assumed a six month change in the expected term or a basis point change in expected volatility  the value of a newly granted hypothetical stock option would increase decrease by the following percentages increase decrease expected term expected volatility sensitivity to change in assumptions was determined using the black scholes merton valuation model compared to the following original assumptions stock price and exercise price equal to the closing market price of blue nile  inc common stock on december   expected term of years  expected volatility of  expected dividend yield of and a risk free investment rate of

substantially all of our net sales consist of diamonds and fine jewelry sold via the internet  net of estimated returns 
historically  net sales have been higher in the fourth quarter as a result of higher consumer spending during the holiday season 
we expect this seasonal trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
we also generate net sales from shipping upgrades 
gross profit 
our gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold to customers  inbound and outbound shipping costs  depreciation on assembly related assets  insurance on shipments and the costs incurred to set diamonds into ring  earring and pendant settings  including labor and related facilities costs 
our gross profit has fluctuated historically and we expect it to continue to fluctuate based primarily on our product acquisition costs  product mix and pricing decisions
