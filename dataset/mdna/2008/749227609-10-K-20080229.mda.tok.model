table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialty finance company that provides a comprehensive set of debt financing options to the real estate industry 
we originate and invest in real estate related assets that are underwritten through an integrated investment process 
we conduct our business through our subsidiaries  rait partnership and taberna  as well as through their respective subsidiaries 
rait is a self managed and self advised maryland reit 
taberna is also a maryland reit 
our objective is to provide our shareholders with total returns over time  including quarterly distributions and capital appreciation  while seeking to manage the risks associated with our investment strategy 
beginning in the second half of  there have been unprecedented disruptions in the credit markets  abrupt and significant devaluations of assets directly or indirectly linked to the us real estate finance markets  and the attendant removal of liquidity  both long and short term  from the capital markets 
these conditions have had  and we expect will continue to have  an adverse effect on us and companies we finance 
during  we recorded material asset impairments due primarily to credit deterioration of trups issuers in the residential mortgage or homebuilder sectors that collateralized securitizations we consolidate 
these impairments are the primary cause of our reported gaap net loss during in addition  during  the market valuation for many classes of assets in our investment portfolio was impaired and our ability to finance them reduced 
defaults of residential mortgages in our investment portfolio also increased 
while we believe we have appropriately valued the assets in our investment portfolio at december   we cannot assure you that further impairment will not occur or that our assets will otherwise not be adversely effected by market conditions 
the events occurring in the credit markets have impacted our financing strategies 
the market for securities issued by securitizations collateralized by assets similar to those in our investment portfolio has contracted severely 
while we were able to sponsor a number of securitizations in  we expect our ability to sponsor new securitizations will be limited for the foreseeable future 
short term financing through warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements has become less available and reliable as increasing volatility in the valuation of assets similar to those we originate has increased the risk of margin calls 
these events have impacted and we expect will continue to impact our ability to finance our business on a long term  match funded basis and may impede our ability to originate loans and securities 
we expect our fee income will be reduced as compared to historical levels due to our current reduced origination and securitization levels 
beginning in the second half of  we have focused on managing our exposure to liquidity risks primarily by reducing our exposure to possible margin calls under repurchase agreements  seeking to conserve our liquidity and generating our adjusted earnings 
we reduced our exposure to margin calls by paying down our repurchase agreements balances by billion during to million as of december  we have continued to manage our liquidity and originate new assets primarily through capital recycling as payoffs occur and through existing capacities within our completed securitizations 
while we recorded asset impairments as a result of the developments in the credit markets resulting in our reported gaap net loss during  we declared common dividends of per share 
we expect to continue to generate fee income and net investment income from our current investment portfolio and generate dividends for our shareholders 
we have been able to identify opportunities for investments that generate returns that are in excess of historical levels and expect to begin increasing the rate at which we originate investments over our current historically low rate during the course of  primarily in commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans and other loans and assets under management in europe 
we are also seeking to develop new sources of financing  including additional bank financing  and increased use of co investment  participations and joint venture strategies that will enable us to originate investments and generate fee income while preserving capital 
while the events above have significantly impacted our results of operations and ability to finance our growth for the foreseeable future  we completed the following significant transactions in capital raising events 
during  we raised approximately million in capital through the issuance of common shares  preferred shares  convertible senior notes and other indebtedness 
see 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources below for a further discussion 
in connection with our convertible senior note issuance  we terminated our million secured line of credit led by keybanc capital markets  as syndication agent 
securitization transactions 
during  we completed five securitization transactions and raised billion to match fund our investments on a long term basis through the completion of our taberna viii  taberna ix  rait ii  taberna europe i  taberna europe ii and merrill lynch mortgage backed securities series securitizations 
while taberna europe i and taberna europe ii are not consolidated in our financial statements  these securitization transactions in europe provided us with billion or billion as of december  of capacity to finance our investment in real estate related securities in europe 
we retained million or million as of december  of par amount preference shares and non investment grade notes issued from taberna europe i and taberna europe ii 
see liquidity and capital resources below for a further discussion 
sale of retained interest in securitizations 
during  we sold million par amount of our retained interests in our taberna ii and taberna v securitizations for  and  as a result  determined that we were not the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity pursuant to fin r 
the deconsolidations were treated as the sale of the net assets of the securitizations resulting in the removal of the securitization assets and liabilities totaling billion and billion respectively  from our balance sheet and we recorded a loss on sale of million 
at the time of sale  our basis in the remaining retained interests was negative due to the asset impairments recorded during and the loss on sale of the net assets of the securitizations 
a resulting gain on deconsolidation of million was recorded 
as a result of these deconsolidation transactions and resulting gains and losses  we recorded a net gain on deconsolidation of million 
see item financial statements 
we may in the future sell additional retained interests in our consolidated securitizations which may result in their deconsolidation if we find that to be in our best interests 
any such sale may have material effects on our financial results in the period in which they occur 
asset impairments and loan loss reserves 
during  we recorded other than temporary impairments of million on our investments in securities net of million in allocations to minority interests  million on certain of our identified intangible assets and million on goodwill 
asset impairments on our investments in securities were attributable primarily to i trups issued by companies in the residential mortgage or homebuilder sectors that collateralized securitizations we consolidate and ii debt securities issued by securitizations collateralized primarily by securities issued by companies in these sectors 
these impairments resulted primarily from the broad disruption of the us credit markets relating to the residential mortgage and homebuilder sectors that began in july the withdrawal of most sources of available liquidity for companies active in these sectors caused payment defaults and significant reductions in the fair value of securities issued by these companies 
furthermore  we recorded asset impairment charges on certain of our identified intangible assets and our goodwill as the events described above have negatively impacted the fair value of the reporting units in relation to their book value  and as a result  the recoverability of certain of our identified intangibles and goodwill 
additionally  during  we increased our loan loss reserves relating to our commercial mortgages and mezzanine loans by million and million relating to our residential mortgages 
the increase in loan loss reserves is the direct result of increased delinquencies in our residential and commercial loan portfolios during while we believe we have appropriately determined the level of impairment and reserves as of december   we cannot assure you that no further temporary or other than temporary impairments or reserves will occur in the future 

table of contents trends that may affect our business the following trends may affect our business capital markets  liquidity and credit risk 
we expect that the credit events occurring during  which have significantly reduced market liquidity and limited our financing strategies  will continue to significantly limit our ability to finance investments in our targeted asset classes for the foreseeable future 
we also expect that these events may cause additional covenant defaults  increased delinquencies or missed payments from issuers of trups  our portfolio of commercial real estate loans or from our portfolio of residential mortgage loans 
this will cause a reduction in our net investment income  an increase in our loan loss provision  an increase in our asset impairment expense and may reduce the cash flows we receive from our securitizations 
during  we have recorded asset impairment expenses within our investment in securities of million as a result from payment and covenant defaults caused by the credit market events during and a declining housing market 
additionally  delinquencies in our residential mortgage loans and commercial loans have increased by million and million  respectively  during these increased delinquencies have caused us to increase our provision for loan losses on our residential mortgage and commercial loans by million and million  respectively  during to finance investments in our commercial loan portfolio in the future  management will seek to structure match funded financing opportunities through the use of restricted cash in  and through the reinvestment of amounts received under  our current securitizations and through loan participations  bank lines of credit  joint venture opportunities and other methods that preserve our capital while making investments that generate an attractive return 
interest rate environment 
interest rates experienced significant volatility during the year ended december  continued volatility in interest rates may impact the fair value of our investments and or the net investment income generated by those investments in the future 
we do not expect that an increase or decrease in interest rates would dramatically impact our net investment income generated by our residential mortgage and commercial and mezzanine loan portfolios 
our investments in residential mortgages have been financed through the issuance of mortgage backed securities that bear interest at rates with similar terms as those of the underlying residential mortgages  effectively match funding our investments with our liabilities 
in the case of investments in commercial and mezzanine loans  we use floating rate line of credit borrowings and long term floating rate cdo notes payable to finance our investments 
much like our investments in securities discussed above  to the extent the quantity of fixed rate commercial and mezzanine loans are not directly offset by matching fixed rate cdo notes payable  we utilize interest rate derivative contracts to convert our floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities  effectively match funding our assets with our liabilities 
our investments in securities are comprised of trups  subordinated debentures  unsecured debt securities and cmbs held by our consolidated cdo entities 
these securities bear fixed and floating interest rates 
a large portion of these fixed rate securities are hybrid instruments  which convert to floating rate securities after a five or ten year fixed rate period 
we have financed these securities through the issuance of floating rate and fixed rate cdo notes payable 
a large portion of the cdo notes payable are floating rate instruments  and we use interest rate swaps to effectively convert this floating rate debt into fixed rate debt during the period in which our investments in securities are paid at a fixed rate 
by using this hedging strategy  we believe we have effectively match funded our assets with liabilities during the fixed rate period of our investments in securities 
an increase or decrease in interest rates will generally not impact our net investment income generated by our investments in securities 
however  an increase or decrease in interest rates will affect the fair value of our investments in securities  which will generally be reflected in our financial statements as changes in other comprehensive income unless other than temporary impairments of our securities occur  in which case the impairment would be reflected as a charge against our earnings 
prepayment rates 
prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise  but changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict 
prepayment rates on our assets also may be affected by other factors  including  without limitation  conditions in the housing  real estate and financial markets  general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on adjustable rate and fixed rate loans 
if 
table of contents interest rates begin to fall  triggering an increase in prepayment rates in our residential mortgage and commercial loan portfolio  our net investment income would decrease 
competition 
we compete for our targeted investments 
while we expect that the size and growth of the market for our products will continue to provide us with a variety of investment opportunities  competition may have adverse effects on our business 
competition may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us 
competition may also result in higher prices  lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs  making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms and reducing the fee income we realize from the origination and management of our securitizations 
in addition  competition may lead us to pay a greater portion of the origination fees that we expect to collect in our future origination activities to third party investment banks and brokers that introduce investments to us in order to continue to generate new business from these sources 
critical accounting estimates and policies we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of how we report our financial condition and results of operations because their application places the most significant demands on the judgment of our management 
our financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition for investment income 
we recognize interest income from investments in debt and other securities  residential mortgages  commercial mortgages and mezzanine loans on a yield to maturity basis 
upon the acquisition of a loan at a discount  we assess the portions of the discount that constitutes accretable yields and non accretable differences 
the accretable yield represents the excess of our expected cash flows from the loan over the amount we paid for the loan 
that amount  the accretable yield  is accreted to interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
many of our commercial mortgages and mezzanine loans provide for the accrual of interest at specified rates which differ from current payment terms 
interest income is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management s determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible 
origination fees and direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized to net investment income  using the effective interest method  over the contractual life of the underlying loan security or loan  in accordance with sfas no 
we recognize interest income from interests in certain securitized financial assets on an estimated effective yield to maturity basis 
management estimates the current yield on the amortized cost of the investment based on estimated cash flows after considering prepayment and credit loss experience 
revenue recognition for cdo structuring fees 
we receive structuring fees for services rendered in connection with the formation of cdo securitization entities 
the structuring fee is a contractual fee paid when the related services are completed 
the structuring fee is a negotiated fee with the investment bank acting as placement agent for the cdo securities and is capitalized by the cdo securitization entity as a deferred financing cost 
from time to time  we may decide to invest in the debt or equity securities issued by cdo securitization entities 
we evaluate our investment in these entities under fin r to determine whether the entity is a vie  and  if so  whether or not we are the primary beneficiary 
if we determine we are the primary beneficiary  we will consolidate the accounts of the cdo securitization entity into our consolidated financial statements 
upon consolidation  we eliminate intercompany transactions  specifically the structuring fees and deferred financing costs paid 
revenue recognition for fees and other income 
we generate fee and other income  through our various subsidiaries  by providing a ongoing asset management services to cdo investment portfolios under cancellable management agreements  b providing or arranging to provide financing to our borrowers  and 
table of contents c providing financial consulting to our borrowers 
we recognize revenue for these activities when the fees are fixed or determinable  evidenced by an arrangement  collection is reasonably assured and the services under the arrangement have been provided 
cdo asset management fees are an administrative cost of a cdo entity and are paid by the cdo administrative trustee on behalf of its investors 
these asset management fees are recognized when earned and are paid quarterly 
asset management fees from consolidated cdos are eliminated in consolidation 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
when we obtain an explicit or implicit interest in an entity  we evaluate the entity to determine if the entity is a vie  and  if so  whether or not we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  in accordance with fin r 
generally  we consolidate vies where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary or non vies which we control 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the variable interest holder that absorbs the majority of the variability in the expected losses or receives the majority of the residual returns of the vie 
when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie  we consider the aggregate of our explicit and implicit variable interests as a single variable interest of the vie 
if our single variable interest absorbs the majority of the variability in the expected losses of the vie or receives the majority of the vie s residual returns  we are considered the primary beneficiary of the vie 
in the case of non vies or vies i we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary and ii we do not control the entity  but have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity  we account for our investment under the equity method ie  at cost  increased or decreased by our share of the earnings or losses  less distributions 
we reconsider our determination of whether an entity is a vie and whether we are the primary beneficiary of such vie if certain events occur 
we have determined that certain special purpose trusts formed by issuers of trups to issue such securities are vies  which we refer to as trust vies  and that the holder of the majority of the trups issued by the trust vies would be the primary beneficiary of  and would consolidate  the trust vies 
in most instances  we are the primary beneficiary of the trust vies because we hold  either explicitly or implicitly  the majority of the trups issued by the trust vies 
certain trups issued by trust vie entities are initially financed directly by cdos or through our warehouse facilities 
under the warehouse agreements  we are required to deposit cash collateral with the investment bank providing the warehouse facility and as a result  we bear the first dollar risk of loss up to our collateral amount if an investment held under the warehouse facility is liquidated at a loss 
this arrangement causes us to hold an implicit interest in the trust vies that have issued the trups held by our warehouse providers 
the primary assets of the trust vies are subordinated debentures issued by the sponsors of the trust vies in exchange for the trups proceeds 
these subordinated debentures have terms that mirror the trups issued by the trust vies 
upon consolidation of the trust vies  these subordinated debentures  which are assets of the trust vies  are included in our financial statements and the related trups are eliminated 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
classifying notes received for capital stock  subordinated debentures issued to trust vies as payment for common equity securities issued by trust vies are recorded net of the common equity securities issued 
transfers of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
we account for transfers of financial assets and the extinguishment of related liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  as amended and interpreted  or sfas no 
 as either sales or financings 
to the extent we acquire assets that are treated as financings under sfas no 
 we record our investment at amortized cost and categorize the investment as either a security related receivable or mortgage related receivable in our financial statements 
one of the criteria that must be met for a transfer of financial assets to be treated as a sale is that the transferor must relinquish effective control over the assets and retain no continuing involvement with the assets 
if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie that issues trups  and thereby consolidate the vie  upon a subsequent transfer of the trups to a cdo entity in which we invest or that we manage  we may not qualify for sale accounting 
in that event  we would continue to consolidate the vie assets 
although the warehouse obligations would be extinguished by the cdo s purchase of the trups  the cdo debt obligations would be recorded in consolidation 

table of contents investments 
we invest primarily in debt securities  residential mortgage portfolios and mortgage related receivables  commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans and may invest in other types of real estate related assets 
we account for our investments in securities under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as amended and interpreted  or sfas no 
 and designate each investment as a trading security  an available for sale security  or a held to maturity security based on management s intent at the time of acquisition 
under sfas no 
 trading securities are recorded at their fair value each reporting period with fluctuations in fair value reported as a component of earnings 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
fair value is based primarily on quoted market prices from independent pricing sources when available for actively traded securities or discounted cash flow analyses developed by management using current interest rates and other market data for securities without an active market 
management s estimate of fair value is subject to a high degree of variability based upon market conditions and management assumptions 
upon the sale of an available for sale security  the realized gain or loss on the sale will be recorded as a component of earnings in the respective period 
held to maturity investments are carried at amortized cost at each reporting period 
we account for our investments in subordinated debentures owned by trust vies that we consolidate as available for sale securities 
these vies have no ability to sell  pledge  transfer or otherwise encumber the trust or the assets of the trust until such subordinated debenture s maturity 
we account for investments in securities where the transfer meets the criteria under sfas no 
as a financing  at amortized cost 
our investments in security related receivables represent securities that were transferred to cdo securitization entities in which the transferors maintained some level of continuing involvement 
we account for our investments in residential mortgages and mortgage related receivables  commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans and other loans at amortized cost 
the carrying value of these investments is adjusted for origination discounts or premiums  non refundable fees and direct costs for originating loans which are amortized into income on a level yield basis over the terms of the loans 
mortgage related receivables represent loan receivables secured by residential mortgages  the legal title to which is held by our trust subsidiaries 
these residential mortgages were transferred to the trust subsidiaries in transactions accounted for as financings under sfas no 
mortgage related receivables maintain all of the economic attributes of the underlying residential mortgages and all benefits or risks of that ownership inure to the trust subsidiary 
management uses its judgment to determine whether an investment has sustained an other than temporary decline in value 
if management determines that an investment has sustained an other than temporary decline in its value  the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to earnings  and we establish a new cost basis for the investment 
if a security that is available for sale sustains an other than temporary impairment  the identified impairment is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings  thereby establishing a new cost basis 
our evaluation of an other than temporary decline is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances 
factors that we consider in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include the estimated fair value of the investment in relation to its cost basis  the financial condition of the related entity  and the intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the fair value of the investment 
we maintain an allowance for losses on our investments in residential mortgages and mortgage related receivables  commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans and other loans 
our allowance for losses is based on management s evaluation of known losses and inherent risks in the portfolios  for example  historical and industry loss experience  economic conditions and trends  estimated fair values  the quality of collateral and other relevant factors 
specific allowances for losses are established for impaired loans based on a comparison of the recorded carrying value of the loan to either the present value of the loan s expected cash flow  the loan s estimated market price or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
the allowance is increased by charges to operations and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries 

table of contents intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets represent identifiable intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions 
we amortize identified intangible assets to expense over their estimated lives using the straight line method 
we evaluate intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis  and as events and circumstances change  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

due to current market and economic conditions  management evaluated the carrying value of intangible assets 
based upon that evaluation  management concluded certain intangible assets were impaired and recorded asset impairment expense of million for the year ended december  this charge was included in asset impairment expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we expect to record amortization expense of intangible assets as follows by fiscal year million  million  million  million  million and million thereafter 
goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets represents the amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired from business acquisitions accounted for under sfas no 
 business combinations 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill is not amortized to expense but rather is analyzed for impairment 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and as events and circumstances change  in accordance with sfas as of december   management determined that goodwill was impaired and charged off all of the goodwill balance to asset impairment expense 
accounting for off balance sheet arrangements 
we maintain warehouse financing arrangements with various investment banks and engage in cdo securitizations 
prior to the completion of a cdo securitization  our warehouse providers acquire investments in accordance with the terms of the warehouse facilities 
we are paid the difference between the interest earned on the investments and the interest charged by the warehouse providers from the dates on which the respective investments were acquired 
we bear the first dollar risk of loss  up to our warehouse deposit amount  if i an investment funded through the warehouse facility becomes impaired or ii a cdo is not completed by the end of the warehouse period  and in either case  the warehouse provider is required to liquidate the securities at a loss 
these off balance sheet arrangements are not consolidated by us because our risk of loss is generally limited to the cash collateral held by the warehouse providers and our warehouse facilities are not special purpose vehicles 
however  since we hold an implicit variable interest in many entities funded under our warehouse facilities  we often do consolidate the trust vies while the trups they issue are held on the warehouse lines 
the economic return earned from these warehouse facilities is considered a non hedge derivative and is recorded at fair value in our financial statements 
changes in fair value are reflected in earnings in the respective period 
accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings  consistent with our intention to qualify as a reit 
certain of the techniques used to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations may also be used to protect against declines in the market value of assets that result from general trends in debt markets 
the principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and or costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties  we are potentially exposed to credit loss 
however  because of the high credit ratings of our counterparties  we do not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  or sfas no 
 we measure each derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts at fair value and record it in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedges  the changes in fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings 
for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge  the changes in the fair value of the effective portions of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income 
amounts included in 
table of contents accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings in the period the underlying hedged item affects earnings 
changes in the ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings 
income taxes 
we and taberna have elected to be taxed as a reit and to comply with the related provisions of the internal revenue code 
accordingly  we generally will not be subject to us federal income tax to the extent of our current distributions to shareholders and as long as certain asset  income and share ownership tests are met 
if we were to fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to us federal income tax which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and amounts available for distribution to our shareholders 
management believes that all of the criteria to maintain our reit qualification have been met for all periods  but there can be no assurance that these criteria have been met for these periods or will continue to be met in subsequent periods 
we maintain various trss which may be subject to us federal  state and local income taxes and foreign taxes 
from time to time  these trss generate taxable income from intercompany transactions 
the trs entities generate taxable revenue from fees for services provided to cdo entities 
some of these fees paid to the trs entities are capitalized as deferred costs by the cdo entities 
in consolidation  these fees are eliminated when the cdo entity is included in the consolidated group 
nonetheless  all income taxes are expenses and are paid by the trss in the year in which the taxable revenue is received 
these income taxes are not eliminated when the related revenue is eliminated in consolidation 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instrument sfas no 

key provisions of sfas no 
include a broad fair value measurement option for certain hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation  clarification that only the simplest separations of interest payments and principal payments qualify for the exception afforded to interest only strips and principal only strips from derivative accounting under paragraph of sfas no 
 thereby narrowing such exception  a requirement that beneficial interests in securitized financial assets be analyzed to determine whether they are free standing derivatives or whether they are hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation  clarification that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and elimination of the prohibition on a qspe holding passive derivative financial instruments that pertain to beneficial interests that are or contain a derivative financial instrument 
in general  these changes will reduce the operational complexity associated with bifurcating embedded derivatives  and increase the number of beneficial interests in securitization transactions  including interest only strips and principal only strips  required to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no

performance measures we use adjusted earnings  total fees generated  assets under management  or aum  and economic book value as tools to measure our financial and operating performance 
the following defines these measures and describes their relevance to our financial and operating performance adjusted earnings we measure our performance using adjusted earnings in addition to net income loss 
adjusted earnings represents net income loss available to common shares  computed in accordance with gaap  before depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  provision for losses  unrealized gains losses on hedges  asset impairments  net of minority interests  net gain on deconsolidation of vies  share based compensation  write off of unamortized deferred financing fees  deferred fee revenue and our deferred tax provisions 
these items are recorded in accordance with gaap and are typically non cash items that do not impact our operating performance or dividend paying ability 
management views adjusted earnings as a useful and appropriate supplement to gaap net income loss because it helps us evaluate our performance without the effects of certain gaap adjustments 
table of contents that may not have a direct financial impact on our current operating performance and our dividend paying ability 
we use adjusted earnings to evaluate the performance of our investment portfolios  our ability to generate fees  our ability to manage our expenses and our dividend paying ability before the impact of non cash adjustments recorded in accordance with gaap 
we believe this is a useful performance measure for investors to evaluate these aspects of our business as well 
the most significant adjustments we exclude in determining adjusted earnings are amortization of intangible assets  provision for losses  asset impairments and share based compensation 
management excludes all such items from its calculation of adjusted earnings because these items are not economic charges or losses which would impact our current operating performance 
by excluding these significant items  adjusted earnings reduces an investor s understanding of our operating performance by excluding i management s expectation of possible losses from our investment portfolio  ii the allocation of non cash costs of generating fee revenue during the periods in which we are receiving such revenue  and iii share based compensation required to retain and incentivize our management team 
adjusted earnings  as a non gaap financial measurement  does not purport to be an alternative to net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  or a measure of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
instead  adjusted earnings should be reviewed in connection with net income loss and cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities in our consolidated financial statements to help analyze management s expectation of potential future losses from our investment portfolio and other non cash matters that impact our financial results 
adjusted earnings and other supplemental performance measures are defined in various ways throughout the reit industry 
investors should consider these differences when comparing our adjusted earnings to these other reits 
the table below reconciles the differences between reported net income loss and adjusted earnings for the following periods amounts in thousands  except share and per share information for the year ended december net income loss available to common shares  as reported add deduct depreciation amortization of intangible assets provision for losses unrealized gains losses on interest rate hedges net gain loss on deconsolidation of vies asset impairments  net of minority interest allocation of  share based compensation  including stock forfeitures of  during the year ended december  write off of unamortized deferred financing costs fee income deferred deferred tax provision benefit adjusted earnings represents the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs resulting from our termination of our line of credit in april 
table of contents total fees generated total fees generated represents the total fees generated  without consideration for the deferral of fees  as yield adjustments  in accordance with gaap 
this data is useful to management as a gauge of our cash revenue as it drives earnings at our taxable reit subsidiaries for distribution to us and ultimately to our shareholders 
during the three years ended december   total fees generated reconciles to our gaap fees and other income as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december fees and other income  as reported add deduct asset management fees eliminated deferred structuring fees deferred origination fees  net of amortization total fees generated assets under management aum represents the total assets that we own or are managing for third parties 
while not all aum generates fee income  it is an important operating measure to gauge our asset growth  volume of originations  size and scale of our operations and our financial performance 
aum includes our total investment portfolio and assets associated with unconsolidated cdos for which we derive asset management fees 
as of december   our total aum was billion  an increase of billion  or  from billion as of december  economic book value we define economic book value as shareholders equity  determined in accordance with gaap  adjusted for the following items liquidation value of preferred shares  unamortized intangible assets  goodwill  and losses recognized in excess of our investments at risk 
economic book value is a non gaap financial measurement  and does not purport to be an alternative to reported shareholders equity  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of book value 
management views economic book value as a useful and appropriate supplement to shareholders equity and book value per share 
the measure serves as an additional measure of our value because it facilitates evaluation of us without the effects of unrealized losses on investments in excess of our value at risk 
under gaap  we are required to absorb unrealized losses on investments of certain of our consolidated entities  primarily our consolidated securitizations  even if those unrealized losses are in excess of our maximum value at risk  or our investment in those securitizations 
unrealized losses recognized in our financial statements  prepared in accordance with gaap  that are in excess of our maximum value at risk are added back to shareholders equity in arriving at economic book value 
economic book value should be reviewed in connection with shareholders equity as set forth in our consolidated balance sheets  to help analyze our value to investors 
economic book value is defined in various ways throughout the reit industry 
investors should consider these differences when comparing our economic book value to that of other reits 

table of contents the table below reconciles the differences between reported shareholders equity  book value  tangible book value and economic book value as of december  dollars in thousands amount per share shareholders equity  as reported add deduct liquidation value of preferred shares book value unamortized intangible assets tangible book value unrealized losses recognized in excess of value at risk economic book value based on  series a preferred shares   series b preferred shares  and  series c preferred shares  all of which have a liquidation preference of per share 
based on  common shares outstanding as of december  reit taxable income to qualify as a reit  we are required to make annual distributions to our shareholders in an amount at least equal to of our reit taxable income  determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains 
in addition  to avoid certain us federal excise taxes  we are required to annually make distributions to our shareholders in an amount at least equal to designated percentages of our net taxable income 
because we expect to make distributions based on the foregoing requirements  and not based on our earnings computed in accordance with gaap  we expect that our distributions may at times be more or less than our reported earnings as computed in accordance with gaap 
total taxable income and reit taxable income are non gaap financial measurements  and do not purport to be an alternative to reported net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
our total taxable income represents the aggregate amount of taxable income generated by us and by our domestic and foreign trss 
reit taxable income is calculated under us federal tax laws in a manner that  in certain respects  differs from the calculation of net income pursuant to gaap 
reit taxable income excludes the undistributed taxable income of our domestic trss  which is not included in reit taxable income until distributed to us 
subject to trs value limitations  there is no requirement that our domestic trss distribute their earnings to us 
reit taxable income  however  generally includes the taxable income of our foreign trss because we will generally be required to recognize and report our taxable income on a current basis 
since we are structured as a reit and the internal revenue code requires that we distribute substantially all of our net taxable income in the form of distributions to our shareholders  we believe that presenting investors with the information management uses to calculate our net taxable income is useful to investors in understanding the amount of the minimum distributions that we must make to our shareholders so as to comply with the rules set forth in the internal revenue code 
because not all companies use identical calculations  this presentation of total taxable income and reit taxable income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures prepared and reported by other companies

the disruption in the credit markets discussed above has reduced our liquidity and capital resources 
as discussed above  due to current market conditions  the cashflow to us from a number of the securitizations we sponsored has been reduced and we do not expect to sponsor new securitizations to provide us with long term financing for the foreseeable future

if we fail to obtain additional financing  the pace of our growth could be reduced

prior to the completion of a cdo securitization  investments are acquired by the warehouse providers in accordance with the terms of the warehouse facilities 
in general  we receive the difference between the interest earned on the investments under the warehouse facilities and the interest charged by the warehouse facilities from the dates on which the respective securities are acquired 
under the warehouse agreements  we are required to deposit cash collateral with the warehouse provider and as a result  we bear the first dollar risk of loss  and in some cases share the first dollar risk of loss  up to our warehouse deposit  if i an investment funded through the warehouse facility becomes impaired or ii a cdo is not completed by the end of the warehouse period  and in either case  if the warehouse facility is 
table of contents required to liquidate the securities at a loss 
the terms of the warehouse facilities are generally at least nine months 
as of december   we had million of cash and other collateral held by warehouse providers 
as of december   we have also pledged up to million of our collateral management fees that we receive from certain cdo s as additional collateral on one of our warehouse facilities 
on september   in connection with closing the second european cdo financing  we fulfilled all of our existing obligations and funding commitments under the related off balance sheet warehouse and terminated that facility 
the warehouse provider retained million in aggregate principal amount of securities that were not transferred to the cdo issuer 
until such time these retained securities are liquidated  to the mutual satisfaction of both parties  we have agreed to deposit million  or million as of december   par amount of the million in principal amount of the subordinated notes of this cdo which we purchased at closing  with the warehouse provider 
as of december   the deposit had a fair value of million  or million 
upon full satisfaction  we expect the return of the million of subordinated notes which are included in warehouse deposits in our consolidated balance sheets 
this arrangement and our warehouse facilities are deemed to be derivative financial instruments and are recorded at fair value each accounting period with the change in fair value recorded in earnings 
a summary of our warehouse facilities is as follows dollars in thousands warehouse facility warehouse availability funding as of december  remaining availability maturity merrill lynch international    march bear  stearns co 
inc   march total the million of remaining financing availability can be used to acquire additional trups securities upon obtaining the approval of the warehouse provider 
the current credit environment may cause us to limit the amount of additional borrowings we undertake under these facilities or result in higher financing costs or increased cash collateral requirements 
the financing costs of these warehouse facilities are based on one month libor plus basis points 
on june   one of our subsidiaries provided an option to a warehouse provider to issue a credit default swap with regard to four reference securities  each with a notional amount of million 
the reference securities are cdo notes payable issued by four of our consolidated cdos 
the option is contingent upon i the termination of our warehouse line agreement and ii our failure to purchase the underlying collateral at an amount which results in no loss to the warehouse provider 
this option had no fair value as of december  on january   we amended this warehouse facility to reduce the capacity from million to million  removed the pledge of million of our collateral management fees as collateral  increased the cash collateral requirement by million  which as of january  was fully funded  and amended the credit default swap to two reference securities  each with a notional of million 
the two reference securities are debt securities issued in taberna vii and taberna viii 
if either of the two reference securities fails to pay interest or principal  has a rating downgrade to ccc or below or certain other events occur  we may be required to pay any shortfall or deliver the reference securities or the cash equivalent 
inflation we believe that inflationary increases in operating expenses will generally be offset by future revenue increases from originating new securities and structuring and managing additional cdo transactions 
we believe that the risk that market interest rates may have on our floating rate debt instruments as a result of future increases caused by inflation is primarily offset by our financing strategy to match the terms of our investment assets with the terms of our liabilities and  to the extent necessary  through the use of hedging instruments

all of this amount has been advanced through cdo notes payable and is included in our restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk results primarily from changes in credit risks of our portfolio and changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk related to our investments in residential mortgages and commercial and mezzanine loans  debt instruments and trups 
credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in a borrower s ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms 
the degree of credit risk varies based on many factors including the concentration of the asset or transaction relative to our entire portfolio  the credit characteristics of the borrower  the contractual terms of a borrower s agreements and the availability and quality of collateral 
we maintain a credit committee that regularly evaluates and approves credit standards and oversees the credit risk management function related to our portfolio of investments 
the credit committee s responsibilities include ensuring the adequacy of our credit risk management infrastructure  overseeing credit risk management strategies and methodologies  monitoring conditions in real estate and other markets having an impact on our lending activities and evaluating and monitoring overall credit risk 
during  we recorded asset impairment charges of million in rait s investment in securities that were attributable primarily to i trups issued by companies in the residential mortgage or homebuilder sectors that collateralized securitizations rait consolidates and also ii to debt securities issued by securitizations collateralized primarily by securities issued by companies in these sectors 
these impairments resulted primarily from the broad disruption of the us credit markets relating to the residential mortgage and homebuilder sectors that began in late july and august the withdrawal of virtually all sources of available liquidity for companies active in these sectors caused payment defaults and significant reductions in the fair value of securities issued by these companies 
additionally  during  we increased our loan loss reserves relating to our commercial mortgages and mezzanine loans by million and million relating 
table of contents to our residential mortgages 
these items were the primary driver of our reported net loss to common shareholders during the year ended december  of million 
while we believe we have appropriately determined the level of impairment and loan loss reserves as of december   we cannot assure you that no further temporary or other than temporary impairments or reserves will occur in the future 
concentrations of credit risk in our normal course of business  we engage in lending activities with borrowers primarily throughout the united states and europe 
as of december   no single borrower or collateral issuer represented greater than of our entire portfolio 
the largest concentration by property type in our commercial and mezzanine portfolio was multi family property  which made up approximately of our commercial and mezzanine loan portfolio 
the largest concentration by borrower type in our trups and subordinated debt portfolio was to issuers in the commercial mortgage industry  which made up approximately of our trups and subordinated debt portfolio 
the largest geographic concentration in our residential mortgage loan portfolio was to borrowers in the state of california  which made up of the residential mortgage loan portfolio 
the largest credit rating concentration in our other securities portfolio was to securities rated bbb by standard and poors  which made up of our other securities portfolio 
for further information on each of our portfolios  please refer to the portfolio summaries in item business 
interest rate risk management interest rates may be affected by economic  geo political  monetary and fiscal policy  market supply and demand and other factors generally outside our control  and such factors may be highly volatile 
our interest rate risk sensitive assets and liabilities and financial derivatives will be typically held for long term investment and not held for sale purposes 
our intent in using securitizations  primarily cdos  to finance our investments is to limit interest rate risk through our financing strategy of matching the terms of our investment assets with the terms of our liabilities and  to the extent necessary  through the use of hedging instruments 
we intend to reduce interest rate and funding risk  allowing us to focus on managing credit risk through our disciplined underwriting process and recurring credit analysis 
we make investments that are either floating rate or fixed rate 
our floating rate investments will generally be priced at a fixed spread over an index such as libor that re prices either quarterly or every days 
given the frequency of future price changes in our floating rate investments  changes in interest rates are not expected to have a material effect on the value of these investments 
increases or decreases in libor will have a corresponding increase or decrease in our interest income and the match funded interest expense  thereby reducing the net earnings impact on our overall portfolio 
our net investment income is also protected from decreases in interest rates due to interest rate floors on our investments in commercial and mezzanine loans 
in the event that long term interest rates increase  the value of our fixed rate investments would be diminished 
we may consider hedging this risk in the future if the benefit outweighs the cost of the hedging strategy 
such changes in interest rates would not have a material effect on the income from these investments 
as of december   we entered into various interest rate swap agreements to hedge variable cash flows associated with cdo notes payable and repurchase agreements 
these cash flow hedges have an aggregate notional value of billion and are used to swap the variable cash flows associated with variable rate cdo notes payable and repurchase agreements into fixed rate payments for five and ten year periods 
as of december   the interest rate swaps had an aggregate liability fair value of million 
changes in the fair value of the ineffective portions of interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps that were not designated as hedges under sfas no 
are recorded in earnings 

table of contents the following table summarizes the change in net investment income for a month period  and the change in the net fair value of our investments and indebtedness assuming an instantaneous increase or decrease of basis points in the libor interest rate curve  both adjusted for the effects of our interest rate hedging activities assets liabilities subject to interest rate sensitivity basis point increase basis point decrease dollars in thousands investment income from variable rate investments investment expense from variable rate indebtedness net investment income from variable rate instruments fair value of fixed rate investments fair value of fixed rate indebtedness net fair value of fixed rate instruments we make investments that are denominated in us dollars  or if made in another currency we may enter into currency swaps to convert the investment into a us dollar equivalent 
we may be unable to match the payment characteristics of the investment with the terms of the currency swap to fully eliminate all currency risk and such currency swaps may not be available on acceptable terms and conditions based upon a cost benefit analysis
