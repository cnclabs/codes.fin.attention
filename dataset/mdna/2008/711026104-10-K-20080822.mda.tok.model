critical accounting policies and significant estimates our significant accounting policies and significant estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  known trends in our industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical policies that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition revenue is recognized when products are shipped  the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  and collection of related receivable is probable 
the allowances for returns as of may  and were approximately  and   respectively 
these allowances are recorded at the time of revenue recognition  if the right of return exists  and are recorded as a reduction of accounts receivable 
the company recognizes shipping and handling revenues as part of revenue  and shipping and handling expenses as part of cost of revenue on the statements of operations 
the company recognizes its subscription based revenue on its measuring up e path prorata over the life of the agreement 
deferred prepublication costs deferred prepublication costs are recorded at their original cost and amortized over a three or five year period  based on the estimated lives of the related publications 
the net carrying value of the deferred prepublication costs is periodically reviewed and compared to an estimate of future net undiscounted cash flows 
on may  and  we had a valuation allowance against these assets of  and  respectively 
if future net undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to realize the net carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge will be recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit to our customers is determined on a customer by customer basis 
trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for the doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts after reviewing individual customer accounts as well as considering both historical and expected credit loss experience 
trade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at may  and and is believed to be adequate for any exposure to loss 
allowance for excess and slow moving inventory we continuously monitor our inventory on hand for salability 
this monitoring includes review of historical sales experience  projected sales activity by title  and any planned changes to a title that are known by us 
any slow moving or non salable inventory identified is reserved or written down at that time 
the reserves of approximately  and  at may  and are believed to be adequate to cover inventory loss exposure 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment on january  sfas r requires us to measure and recognize in our consolidated statements of operations the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to measure the amount of compensation expense to be recognized for each option award 
there are several assumptions that must be made when using the black scholes model such as the expected term of each option  the expected volatility of the stock price during the expected term of the option  the expected dividends to be paid and the risk free interest rate expected during the option term 
of these assumptions  the expected term of the option and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of employees and the expected future performance of our stock 
an increase in the volatility of our stock price or an increase in the average period before exercise will increase the amount of compensation expense on new awards 
dividend yields and risk free interest rates are less difficult to estimate  but an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in compensation expense and an increase in the risk free interest rate will increase compensation expense 
we believe the assumptions used in computing our compensation expense for the periods ended may  and  respectively  are appropriate 
income taxes the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income 
no valuation allowance has been established as of may  or as management is projecting sufficient taxable income to fully realize the net deferred income tax assets over the near term 
if such future levels of taxable income are not sufficient or fail to materialize in the near term  management will establish a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred income tax assets to an amount that they believe is more likely than not to be realized and would also record corresponding income tax expense 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the requirements for a valuation allowance 
twelve months ended may  vs 
twelve months ended may  net revenue in thousands months ended variance variance test preparation  assessment and instruction college preparation total net revenue test preparation  assessment  and instruction revenue for this product group was million for the months ended may   a decrease of compared to the prior year 
testing and assessment revenue was million  flat with the prior year  while instruction revenue was million  down from the prior year 
the product group overall decrease was due in part to an overall decline in supplemental education spending for the past year 
according to association of american publishers  the supplemental education market for the twelve months ended may  was down approximately from the prior year 
we continue to invest in new product development for this product group 
college preparation revenue for this product group was million  an increase of from the prior year 
distribution revenue  which accounts for approximately of the total revenue within this group  was up primarily due to increased market penetration  especially in the private and parochial school markets 
revenue from our proprietary products increased compared to the prior year due to an aggressive sales and marketing plan in which we distinguished ourselves in the market with unique skills based supplements 
we continue to invest in new proprietary product development while actively growing distribution products in fy in spite of current economic challenges  we are optimistic about the opportunities for growth in this market niche 
cost of revenue cost of revenue for the months ended may  was million of revenue compared to million of revenue in the prior year 
cost of revenue consists of two components direct costs and prepublication cost amortization 
direct costs consist of product cost  which includes paper  printing  binding  and prepress costs for proprietary products and product purchases for nonproprietary products  royalties on proprietary products  and warehousing and shipping costs for all products 
direct costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was  an increase from in the prior year 
the percentage increase is primarily due to revenue mix  as college preparation revenue increased from of the total revenue in fiscal to in fiscal college preparation direct costs are substantially higher than the direct cost of testing  assessment and instruction  as the majority of college preparation revenue consists of non proprietary products 
prepublication costs include one time expenses associated with developing and producing new or revised proprietary products 
it includes all editorial expenses  writing  page design and makeup  art and other permissions  prepress  and any other costs incurred up to the print bind stage of the books 
these prepublication costs also include expenses incurred for other forms of product development 
prepublication costs are capitalized and expensed on a straight line basis over a three or five year period  based upon the product 
we believe our amortization policy is in line with industry practice 
for fiscal  we amortized million of prepublication costs  compared to million in the prior year 
we expect fiscal amortization expense to be similar to fiscal  then decreasing in the following years as a result of lower prepublication expenditures 
selling  general and administrative expenses in thousands months ended may  variance variance selling and marketing expense general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal were million  a decrease of from the prior year

selling and marketing expenses for fiscal were million  a decrease of  from the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue the expense decreased from of revenue in the prior year to for fiscal as we continue to closely control costs 
general and administrative expenses for the year were million  flat from the prior year  as we continue to consistently monitor and control these expenses 
interest expense interest expense for the year was million  an increase of  from the prior year 
the change is primarily related to  of non cash interest expense recorded during the year as a result of the mark to market interest rate adjustment related to our swap agreement on our term loan 
income tax benefit for the twelve months ended may   the effective tax rate was compared to in the prior year 
the effective tax rate fluctuation is due to a decrease in the state tax rate apportionment as well as an increase in the temporary and permanent tax differences in book versus taxable loss

this statement is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we do not anticipate any significant changes as a result of adopting sfas liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities for was million  compared to million in net cash provided by operating activities for was primarily provided by our profitability before depreciation and amortization as well as decreases in accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid expenses  and accounts payable 
this was offset by increases in deferred income taxes and deferred revenue 
accounts receivable decreased as a result of a decrease in fourth quarter revenues on a year over year basis 
inventory decreased due to the timing of ordering and receiving products into inventory 
prepaid expenses decreased due to our increase in product sampling 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased primarily due to the timing of payment to vendors 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in net cash used in investing activities for consisted primarily of expenditures for prepublication costs of million in  which represents a decrease of million from the decrease is primarily due to efficiencies realized within our product development process  which allowed us to reduce the development costs on new and revised titles 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million of cash provided by in net cash used in financing activities for  consisted primarily of net repayments under our new bank agreement for both the line of credit and term loan 
net cash provided by financing activities for  consisted primarily of net borrowings under our new bank agreement for both the line of credit and term loan 
on february   we entered into a million credit agreement with sovereign bank to refinance our previous bank credit agreement 
amounts borrowed under the agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
the revolving line of credit provides for advances up to million and expires in march the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is in a range from libor plus to libor plus  or prime to prime plus  with the exact interest rate based on the ratio of the company s total funded debt to ebitda 
at may   million was outstanding under this facility  and million was available for borrowing 
the term loan is for million and matures in december the term loan provides for payments of interest only for the first twelve months and for equal quarterly payments of principal and interest thereafter until maturity 
the term loan bears interest at the same rate as the revolving line of credit for million of the million outstanding 
we entered into a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on the balance of the term loan for three years at a rate of plus an interest spread of to based upon our total funded debt to ebitda ratio 
after the three year period  the interest rate reverts back to a variable rate 
at may   million was outstanding under this agreement 
in may  the company entered into a million letter of credit agreement with sovereign bank 
the interest rate on the letter of credit is libor plus  or prime plus 
the agreement expires may  amounts borrowed under the agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
at may   no amounts were outstanding under this agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants  calculated on a consolidated basis for the company and its subsidiary  which  among other things  impose a maximum ratio of total funded debt to ebitda  and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
these financial covenants restrict the payment of dividends on the company s common stock 
we believe that our cash and borrowing availability under our lines of credit  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our normal cash needs in we intend to continue investing in prepublication costs for our proprietary products to the extent cash flow allows 
as we develop these products for more states  additional working capital investments may be required 
product development product development expenditures for the twelve months ended may  were million  compared to million for the twelve months ended may  we continue to actively develop new and revised products  but as a result of operational efficiencies we have been able to significantly reduce our development expenditures 
we expect the current level of spending to continue in the future 
product development expenditures in were primarily in the testing  assessment  and instruction product group as we continued to roll out new and revised products within our existing states 
the state test preparation market continues to grow  as the states demand higher academic performance from students 
most states have high stakes testing requirements  which mean that students  teachers  and administrators are rewarded for positive test performance or penalized for poor performance 
the support for state standards and testing has been enhanced considerably by the mandates of the no child left behind federal legislation 
presently  we publish test preparation and assessment products for various grades in twelve states 
we intend to focus our product development in the upcoming year on our core  state specific products 
we intend to enter additional states and continue to supplement existing states with additional products 
we also plan to expand our offering of measuring up e path  our electronic  web based assessment and scoring product 
we will continue to produce proprietary college preparation supplements and ancillary materials 
these products will not compete with products we distribute under our existing publisher agreements and will be crafted as supplements to help teachers and students with their college preparation studies 
our strategic growth plan calls for an emphasis on the internal development of products within the test preparation  assessment and instruction product lines 
under favorable circumstances  we would consider an acquisition to supplement our growth plan 
off balance sheet arrangements none seasonality the supplementary school publishing business is seasonal  cycling around the school year that runs from september through may 
typically  the major marketing campaigns  including mailings of new catalogs and focused sales efforts  begin in september when schools reopen
