we measure our performance by focusing on certain key performance indicators such as the number of wireless devices handled  gross margin by service line  operating income  cash flow  cash conversion cycle  return on invested capital and liquidity 
we manage our business based on two distinct service lines which include product distribution and logistic services 
during  wireless devices sold through distribution grew by  and wireless devices handled through logistic services increased by 
our distribution gross margin increased by percentage points to  and our logistic services gross margin increased by percentage points to 
we are focused on increasing the total volume of wireless devices handled as opposed to increasing volume in one specific service line as both service lines provide a reasonable return in relation to the capital invested and the risk assumed 
our revenues are significantly influenced by growth in the total number of wireless devices sold to subscribers globally by the entire industry 
in  it is estimated that the global wireless industry shipped approximately billion wireless devices 
this was an increase of approximately from the total number of wireless devices handled by us grew by from for  we expect to handle over million wireless devices

this increase was partially offset by a decrease in wireless devices handled through logistic services as a result of a reduction in units handled in columbia due to a reduction in promotional activities by our customer and due to increased competition

in addition  we believe we sold more devices to these customers as a result of improved visibility into these channels by serving these customers through our business in singapore rather than our brightpoint asia limited business 
the decrease in average selling price in our asia pacific division was also driven by our singapore business as a result of a significant increase in sales of lower priced handsets due to market demand for these handsets

the acquisition of dangaard telecom expanded our europe operations to include nine countries in which we historically did not have a significant operating presence 
in countries in which both companies had a significant operating presence  the acquisition of dangaard telecom allowed us to increase our market share 
excluding the dangaard telecom operations  distribution revenue in our europe division increased 
the increase in handset based volume excluding the dangaard telecom operations was primarily due to an increase in wireless devices sold by our finland and slovakia operations 
the increase in non handset based revenue was due primarily to an increase in accessories and non voice capable navigation devices sold 
the increase in logistic services revenue was due primarily to the acquisition of dangaard telecom  which was included in our results of operations beginning on august  in order to conform to brightpoint accounting policies and us gaap  dangaard telecom changed its revenue recognition for arrangements where dangaard telecom serves as the agent in the transaction

the increase in distribution gross margin was primarily driven by a shift in mix toward higher margin distribution business in europe resulting from the acquisition of dangaard telecom 
the increase in gross margin in our europe division was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin in our asia pacific division due to sales of the slow moving inventory within asia at lower prices in an effort to improve sell through of these devices 
the decrease in asia pacific gross margin was partially offset by an increase in gross margin on devices sold to customers served by our singapore business 
distribution gross margin in our singapore business was significantly higher than historical levels during the second half of as a result of a strong product line up from our largest supplier as well as favorable product allocations 
there can be no assurances that we will continue to experience similar margins or as favorable product allocations in our singapore business in the future 
the increase in gross profit in our logistic services business was primarily due to the percentage point increase in gross margin from logistic services 
the increase in gross margin from logistic services was primarily driven by our americas division as a result of improved operating efficiency  increased leverage of our cost infrastructure over higher volumes and a shift in mix to fee based prepaid airtime fulfillment net method from prepaid airtime transactions recorded using the gross method 
the increase in wireless devices handled through logistic services in our americas division was primarily driven by our successful launch of logistic services for t mobile during the second quarter of as well as an increase in devices handled for our existing customers

sg a expenses associated with the dangaard operations represented million of the overall increase in sg a expenses for year ended december  we expect sg a as a percent of revenue to be slightly higher in as a result of the full year impact of the operations of dangaard telecom including the impact of conforming dangaard telecom to brightpoint accounting policies 
a majority of our sg a expenses do not vary with seasonal changes in volume 
as a result  we would expect sg a expenses as a percent of revenue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
amortization amortization expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase in amortization expense relates to finite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the cellstar and dangaard telecom transactions 
we allocated the purchase price of the dangaard telecom and cellstar acquisitions based on preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the assets acquired in 
table of contents connection with the dangaard telecom transaction included million of finite lived intangible assets assigned to the customer relationships 
the acquired finite lived intangible assets have a useful life of approximately fifteen years and are being amortized over the period that the assets are expected to contribute to our future cash flows 
the assets are being amortized on an accelerated method based on the projected cash flows used for valuation purposes 
we believe that these cash flows are most reflective of the pattern in which the economic benefit of the finite lived intangible assets will be consumed 
for the fiscal year  we expect to recognize approximately million to million of amortization expense related to the finite lived intangible assets acquired in the dangaard telecom and cellstar acquisitions 
restructuring charge restructuring charge was million for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of  we decided to terminate dangaard telecom s implementation of sap enterprise resource planning and related software 
as part of that decision  the company determined that costs capitalized related to the project in the period after the acquisition of dangaard telecom were impaired under sfas accordingly  an impairment charge of million was recorded in our europe division 
in addition  we recorded million in severance and other costs to consolidate the brightpoint and dangaard telecom operations in germany 
we anticipate taking an additional restructuring charge during the first half of of approximately million to million associated with the final exit of our redundant warehouse and office facility in germany

the increase in operating income from continuing operations in our asia pacific division for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in the volume of devices sold to customers served by our singapore business previously served by our brightpoint asia limited business as a result of improved product availability at competitive prices and new products launched by our suppliers 
distribution gross margin in our singapore business was significantly higher than historical levels during the second half of as a result of a strong product line up from our largest supplier as well as favorable product allocations 
this was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin in our asia pacific division due to sales of the slow moving inventory within asia at lower prices in an effort to improve sell through of these devices 
there can be no assurances that we will continue to experience similar margins or as favorable product allocations in our singapore business in the future 

table of contents the increase in operating income from continuing operations in our europe division was primarily due to the acquisition of dangaard telecom  which significantly expanded our operations in europe 
operating loss from continuing operations in our corporate headquarters increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase in operating loss was due to a million increase in personnel costs primarily due to an increase in headcount in support of overall growth and incentive compensation as well as million of incremental costs associated with integrating the dangaard telecom acquisition 
interest the components of interest  net are as follows year ended december  change amounts in s interest expense interest income interest  net interest expense includes interest on outstanding debt  fees paid for unused capacity on credit lines and amortization of deferred financing fees 
the increase in interest expense for the year december  compared to the prior year was primarily due to debt assumed in the dangaard telecom acquisition and borrowings for the cellstar acquisition 
income tax expense year ended december  change amounts in s income tax expense effective tax rate points income tax expense for the year ended december  is net of a million benefit resulting from a reduction in the statutory tax rate in germany as well as a million benefit related to the reversal of valuation allowances on certain foreign tax credit carryforwards 
based on taxable income and utilization of prior net operating loss carryforwards  it became more likely than not during the second quarter of that we will be able to utilize these foreign tax credits prior to their expiration 
excluding the impact of these benefits  our effective tax rate would have been for the year ended december   primarily due to a shift in mix of income between jurisdictions 
for the fiscal year  we expect our effective tax rate to be within the range of to 
our effective tax rate is typically lower than the united states statutory tax rates primarily due to the benefit from foreign operations that have lower statutory rates than the united states 
return on invested capital from operations roic we believe that it is important for a business to manage its balance sheet as well as it manages its statement of operations 
a measurement that ties the statement of operations performance with the balance sheet performance is return on invested capital from operations  or roic 
we believe that if we are able to grow our earnings while minimizing the use of invested capital  we will be optimizing shareholder value while preserving resources in preparation for further potential growth opportunities 
we take a simple approach in calculating roic we apply an estimated average tax rate to the operating income of our continuing operations with adjustments for unusual items  such as restructuring charges  and apply this tax adjusted operating income to our average capital base  which  in our case  is our shareholders equity and debt 
the details of this measurement are outlined below 

table of contents year ended december  amounts in s operating income after taxes operating income from continuing operations plus restructuring charge benefit less estimated income taxes operating income after taxes invested capital debt shareholders equity invested capital average invested capital roic estimated income taxes were calculated by multiplying the sum of operating income from continuing operations and the facility consolidation charge by the respective periods effective tax rate 
average invested capital for the annual periods represents the simple average of the invested capital amounts for the current and four prior quarter period ends 
roic is calculated by dividing operating income after taxes by average invested capital 
the decline in roic from to was primarily due to the increase in average invested capital compared the prior year 
average invested capital was negatively impacted for the year ended december  by an increase in invested capital to fund the acquisitions of dangaard telecom and cellstar  including million of acquired goodwill 
operating income after taxes was positively impacted for the year ended december  compared to the prior year by the million tax benefit resulting from a reduction in the statutory tax rate in germany in the third quarter of in addition  operating income after taxes was positively impacted for the year ended december  by the million tax benefit related to the reversal of valuation allowances on certain foreign tax credits during the second quarter of in addition  operating income after taxes was negatively impacted for the year ended december  by million after tax of non cash amortization expense related to finite lived intangible assets in connection with the acquisitions of dangaard telecom and cellstar discussed above 
our overall roic may continue to decrease  and we currently estimate that it could go as low as to 
we anticipate that our roic will trend upwards from this low point as we complete the integration of dangaard telecom  obtain anticipated synergies  obtain combined balance sheet improvements and reduce our debt

during we believe we increased our market share with tier and tier operators through our preferred supplier agreements with revol and the associated carrier group acg 
we believe these preferred supplier agreements continue to enhance our relationship with motorola and other product suppliers within the regional carrier channel 
the increase in wireless devices handled through logistic services in our americas division was due primarily to increased demand as a result of market growth experienced by current logistic services customers as well as expanded services offered to our current logistic services customers 
the growth in wireless devices handled through logistic services in our americas division was slowed by a decline in volume in colombia resulting from a decision by our primary network operator customer in colombia to reduce promotional activities significantly during the second half of due to market saturation in colombia 
the higher volume of wireless devices we previously handled in colombia was driven primarily by aggressive promotional activity by this operator customer in order to increase their market share 
as a result of this operator s decision to focus on profitability and asset management  we do not expect volume to return to levels we experienced in previous quarters 
average fulfillment fee per unit decreased primarily due to volume based tiered pricing as a result of certain of our current logistic services customers meeting volume thresholds to achieve a lower pricing tier during the fourth quarter of in addition  average fulfillment fee was negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of due to a reduced fee structure associated with the modification and extension of a logistic services agreement with a significant customer in our north america business

the increase in distribution revenue and wireless devices sold through our operations in india was a result of increased volumes with our existing suppliers as well as diversifying our supplier base 
revenue in our asia pacific division also increased as a result of an expanded global relationship with a major original equipment manufacturer 
we made significant purchases of wireless devices near the end of september and near the end of december  which were procured under the terms of an existing supply agreement with this manufacturer in the philippines 
however  we intend to sell the products through all of our international operations including those outside of the asia pacific region 
sales of these wireless devices positively contributed to growth in distribution revenue in our asia pacific division  however  a significant portion of this inventory remained unsold as of the end of the terms of the purchase provided for more favorable payment terms than were reflected in the existing supply agreement 
the increases in distribution revenue and wireless devices from our brightpoint asia limited business  our operations in india and from this expanded global relationship were partially offset by a decrease in revenue and wireless devices sold through our distribution business in australia 
the decrease in revenue and wireless devices sold through our distribution business in australia was due to the decision by a certain network operator to change to a closed distribution model for g wireless devices as well as a change in terms with a significant customer in that market to a fee based logistic services arrangement from a distribution arrangement 
increases in logistic services revenue in australia and india were offset by a decrease in logistic services revenue in new zealand 
the decrease in logistic services revenue in new zealand was due to the reduction in revenue from the sale of prepaid airtime in new zealand as a result of the decision by a major network operator to change from prepaid airtime cards to electronic distribution 
we are not participating in electronic airtime distribution in new zealand 
the increase in logistic services revenue in australia resulted from an increase in handset fulfillment revenue due to a shift to a fee based logistic services arrangement from a distribution arrangement with a significant customer in that market as discussed previously

our americas division experienced lower gross margin from handset fulfillment due in part to the reduced volume in colombia as discussed previously

had this payment been received in  net cash provided by operating activities would have been million 
net cash used for investing activities was million for  an increase of million compared to prior year primarily due to million more cash used for acquisitions during compared to due primarily to the acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities related to the us operations and the miami based latin america business of cellstar corporation 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  a change of million compared to prior year primarily due to million additional proceeds from credit facilities in compared to the prior year 
million proceeds from the global term loans million less cash used for the purchase of treasury stock in compared to the prior year 
partially offset by million cash used for repayments of long term debt compared to the prior year including million of cash used for repayments of debt acquired through the acquisition of dangaard telecom and million of cash used for repayments of the global term loans 

table of contents cash conversion cycle year ended december  days sales outstanding in accounts receivable days inventory on hand days payable outstanding cash conversion cycle days our calculation of the cash conversion cycle has not been adjusted to include pro forma results of operations for the us operations and the miami based latin america business of cellstar corporation and pro forma results of operations for dangaard telecom as described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  our cash conversion cycle days are higher primarily due to the fact that daily sales and cost of products sold do not include a full year of sales and cost of products sold for these acquisitions 
a key source of our liquidity is our ability to invest in inventory  sell the inventory to our customers  collect cash from our customers and pay our suppliers 
we refer to this as the cash conversion cycle 
the cash conversion cycle is measured by the number of days it takes to effect the cycle of investing in inventory  selling the inventory  paying suppliers and collecting cash from customers 
the components in the cash conversion cycle are days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  days inventory on hand  and days payables outstanding 
the cash conversion cycle  as we measure it  is the netting of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable and days inventory on hand with the days of payable outstanding 
circumstances when the cash conversion cycle decreases generally generate cash for the company 
conversely  circumstances when the cash conversion cycle increases generally consume cash in the form of additional investment in working capital 
during  the cash conversion cycle increased to days from days in the increase in the cash conversion cycle was the primarily due to the dangaard telecom acquisition 
the detail calculation of the components of the cash conversion cycle is as follows a days sales outstanding in accounts receivable ending accounts receivable for continuing operations divided by average daily revenue inclusive of value added taxes for foreign operations for the period 
b days inventory on hand ending inventory for continuing operations divided by average daily cost of revenue excluding indirect product and service costs for the period 
c days payables outstanding ending accounts payable for continuing operations divided by average daily cost of revenue excluding indirect product and service costs for the period

borrowings the table below summarizes borrowing capacity that was available to the company as of december  in thousands gross letters of credit net availability outstanding guarantees availability global term loans global credit facility other total as noted above  in conjunction with the acquisition of dangaard telecom we obtained additional financing in the current year including i an increase in the amount available under our secured revolving credit facility to million  ii the extension to the domestic borrowers of our credit agreement of a term loan in an original principal amount of million  iii the extension to the foreign borrowers of our credit agreement  a term loan in an original principal amount equivalent to million denominated in euros 

table of contents liquidity analysis we measure liquidity as the total of unrestricted cash and unused borrowing availability  and we use this measurement as an indicator of how much access to cash we have to either grow the business through investment in new markets  acquisitions  or through expansion of existing service or product lines or to contend with adversity such as unforeseen operating losses potentially caused by reduced demand for our products and services  material uncollectible accounts receivable  or material inventory write downs  as examples 
the table below shows our liquidity calculation 
december  change amounts in s unrestricted cash unused borrowing availability liquidity a large customer within our europe division experienced it difficulties at the end of december  resulting in million of anticipated payments being delayed into the first quarter 
this payment was received on january  this cash payment was used to pay down borrowings on our lines of credit 
we do not expect similar payment delays due to it difficulties from this customer in the future 
had these payments been received in  our unused borrowing availability would have been million 
capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and capital expenditures were primarily related to investments in our information technology infrastructure and software upgrades as well as equipment and leasehold improvements for new facilities  particularly in the us expenditures for capital resources historically have been composed of information systems  leasehold improvements and warehouse equipment 
we expect this pattern to continue in future periods 
we expect to invest in a range of million to million in a key component of our strategic plan is geographic expansion 
we expect our level of capital expenditures to be affected by our geographic expansion activity 
we believe that existing capital resources and cash flows provided by future operations will enable us to maintain our current level of operations and our planned operations including capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we believe that our current liquidity is sufficient to operate the business successfully for the next twelve months and to invest in growth opportunities 
off balance sheet arrangements we have agreements with unrelated third parties for the factoring of specific accounts receivable in our spain and germany operations acquired in the purchase of dangaard telecom in order to reduce the amount of working capital required to fund such receivables 
the factoring of accounts receivable under these agreements are accounted for as sales in accordance with sfas  transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and accordingly  are accounted for as off balance sheet arrangements 
proceeds on the transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount 
the discount is recorded as a charge in interest  net in the consolidated statement of operations in the period of the sale 
net funds received reduced accounts receivable outstanding while increasing cash 
we are the collection agent on behalf of the third parties for these arrangements and have no significant retained interests or servicing liabilities related to the accounts receivable that we have sold 
at december   we had sold million of accounts receivable  which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date 
fees paid under this program were million for the year ended december  
table of contents contractual obligations and commitments our disclosures regarding cash requirements of contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings 
information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period less than to to total year years years thereafter amounts in s operating leases total borrowings interest on third party debt and lines of credit purchase obligations pension obligation letters of credit total interest on third party debt is calculated based on the interest rate as of december  and repayments of outstanding debt in accordance with our credit agreement 
interest does not include the effects of any prepayments of borrowings permitted under the credit agreement 
prepayments could significantly decrease interest obligations in future years 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fin  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex 
consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period as new information becomes available  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical based on the criteria above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements in any one period 
deferred taxes and effective tax rates we estimate the effective tax rates and associated liabilities or assets for each legal entity in accordance with sfas we use tax planning to minimize or defer tax liabilities to future periods 
in recording effective tax rates and related liabilities and assets  we rely upon estimates  which are based upon our interpretation of united states and local tax laws as they apply to our legal entities and our overall tax structure 
audits by local tax jurisdictions  including the united states government  could yield different interpretations from our own and cause the company to owe more or less taxes than originally recorded 
we utilize internal and external skilled resources in the various tax jurisdictions to evaluate our position and to assist in our calculation of tax expense and related liabilities 

table of contents for interim periods  we accrue our tax provision at the effective tax rate that we expect for the full year 
as the actual results from our various businesses vary from our estimates earlier in the year  we adjust the succeeding interim period s effective tax rates to reflect our best estimate for the year to date results and for the full year 
as part of the effective tax rate  if we determine that a deferred tax asset arising from temporary differences is not likely to be utilized  we will establish a valuation allowance against that asset to record it at the expected realizable value 
at december   total deferred tax assets were million  net of million of valuation allowances 
goodwill and long lived asset impairment we assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently when indicators of impairment are present 
at december   we had million of goodwill recorded as an asset 
we perform our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter  and based on our analysis performed in  we determined that there was no impairment of the goodwill balance 
in our impairment analysis we estimate the fair value of an enterprise based on the present value of anticipated future cash flows 
we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the net assets of the enterprise exceed the present value of anticipated future cash flows 
as permitted under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  our determination of the fair value of dangaard telecom for use in our annual impairment analysis was carried forward from the fair value used to determine the purchase price of dangaard telecom 
we test our long lived assets for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets impairment testing  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
at december   the carrying values of our long lived assets do not exceed their respective fair values  and there were no material impairment charges in other than the restructuring charge described below 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we decided to cease dangaard telecom s implementation of sap enterprise resource planning and related software 
as part of that decision  we determined that costs capitalized related to the project in the period after the acquisition of dangaard telecom were impaired under sfas accordingly  an impairment charge was recorded in our europe division and is included within restructuring charge in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  credit rating we are rated by standard poor s 
as of december   our rating was bb with a negative outlook 
an upgrade or downgrade in credit rating would not have an impact on our credit agreement  however access to and pricing in capital markets could be impacted by a downgrade in our credit rating 

table of contents seasonality we are subject to seasonal patterns that generally affect the wireless device industry 
wireless devices are generally used by businesses  governments and consumers 
for businesses and governments  purchasing behavior is affected by fiscal year ends  while consumers are affected by holiday gift giving seasons 
for the global wireless device industry  seasonal patterns for wireless device units handled have been as follows year st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter the seasonal patterns for wireless devices handled by us have been as follows year st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter our calculation of seasonality has not been adjusted to include pro forma results of operations for the us operations and the miami based latin america business of cellstar corporation and pro forma results of operations for dangaard telecom as described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk concentration of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash investments  forward currency contracts and accounts receivable 
we maintain cash investments primarily in aaa rated money market mutual funds and overnight repurchase agreements  which have minimal credit risk 
we place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable 
in many circumstances  we have obtained credit insurance to mitigate our credit risk 
exchange rate risk management a substantial portion of our revenue and expenses are transacted in markets worldwide and may be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in specific countries political  economic or regulatory conditions and trade protection measures 
our foreign currency risk management program is designed to reduce  but not eliminate  unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates by hedging 
generally  through the purchase of forward contracts  we hedge transactional currency risk  but do not hedge foreign currency revenue or future operating income 
also  we do not hedge our investment in foreign subsidiaries  where fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our comprehensive income or loss 
an adverse change defined as a strengthening of the us dollar in all exchange rates  relative to our foreign currency risk management program  would have had no material impact on our results of operations for or at december   we had no cash flow or net investment hedges open 
our sensitivity analysis of foreign currency exchange rate movements does not factor in a potential change in volumes or local currency prices of our products sold or services provided 
actual results may differ materially from those discussed above 
interest rate risk management we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include short term marketable securities 
debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed and variable rate debt 
to mitigate interest rate risks  we utilize interest rate swaps to convert certain portions of our variable rate debt to fixed interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our borrowing arrangements 
our risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility may have on interest expense 
we use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure 
at december   swaps with a total notional amount of million were outstanding 
these swaps have maturity dates ranging from these derivative instruments are designated as hedges under sfas changes in market value  when effective  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 
amounts are recorded to interest expense as settled 
a increase in short term borrowing rates during the quarter would have resulted in only a nominal increase in interest expense 
the fair value liability associated with those swaps was million at december
