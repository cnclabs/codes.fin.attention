item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview introduction pep boys is a leader in the automotive aftermarket  with over stores and more than  service bays located throughout states and puerto rico 
all of our stores feature the nationally recognized pep boys brand name  established through more than years of providing high quality automotive merchandise and services  and are company owned  ensuring chain wide consistency for our customers 
we are the only national chain offering automotive service  accessories  tires and parts under one roof  positioning us to achieve our goal of becoming the category dominant one stop shop for automotive maintenance and accessories 
of our stores  are what we refer to as supercenters  which feature an average of state of the art service bays  with an average of more than  square feet per supercenter 
our store size allows us to display and sell a more complete offering of merchandise in a wider array of categories than our competitors  with a comprehensive tire offering 
we leverage this investment in inventory through our ability to install what we sell in our service bays and by offering this merchandise to both commercial and retail customers 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest january  which results in an extra week every six years 
our fiscal year ended february  was a week year with the fourth quarter including weeks versus weeks in fiscal fiscal included weeks 
all other years included in this report are weeks 
fiscal was a year of significant change for pep boys during which our entire management team developed and  our board of directors approved  our long term strategic plan 
the cornerstones of this five year plan  which was announced on november   are to refocus on core automotive merchandise  optimize our square footage productivity and add incremental service bay density through a hub and spoke growth model 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we began to implement the initial steps of our long term strategic plan  including closing underperforming locations  rebalancing our inventory through an aggressive mark down and sell through program for certain non core and unproductive merchandise in order to allow us to allocate a larger portion of our inventory investment to core automotive merchandise  beginning to monetize our real estate assets  through the completion of a store sale leaseback transaction  the net proceeds of which were used to repay debt and continuing to focus on improving our service center operations 
total revenues for the fiscal year ended february  were  as compared to the  recorded in the prior year 
on a week basis  determined as the first week period in the year  comparable merchandise sales decreased and comparable service revenue increased 
despite a very difficult macroeconomic environment which negatively impacted our entire business throughout  our service center revenue showed steady improvement throughout the year 
we attribute this improvement to our continued focus on our service center productivity  improved service manager retention and a renewed focus on tire sales 
our net loss per share for the year ended february  was per share or a per share increase over the loss per share recorded in a significant portion of this loss was attributable to the initial steps taken in accordance with our long term strategic plan 
during fiscal  we also incurred approximately  in severance and inducement compensation expense in order to strengthen our management team 
these actions  which we believe strengthen our future  contributed to our disappointing fiscal financial results 
we completed a sale leaseback transaction on company owned locations in the fourth quarter resulting in the repayment of  in long term debt 
on march   we consummated a sale and leaseback transaction on properties for an aggregate purchase price of  on april   we consummated a sale leaseback transaction on properties for an aggregate purchase price of  the proceeds from these two additional transactions are expected to be used to reduce indebtedness 
each of the properties sold in these three transactions have been leased back to be operated as pep boys stores for a term of years  with four year renewal options 
our cash flow from operating activities was  in fiscal and our capital expenditure program was  during fiscal we grand reopened stores in the following markets portland  me  boston  ma  providence  ri  springfield  ma  hartford  ct  shreveport  la  baton rouge  la  lafayette  la  new orleans  la  yuma  ca  santa barbara  ca  bakersfield  ca  fresno  ca  sacramento  ca  chico  ca  san francisco  ca  reno  nv totaling first quarter  houston  tx  austin  tx  san antonio  tx  corpus christi  tx  laredo  tx  harlingen  tx  atlanta  ga  macon  ga  savannah  ga totaling second quarter  puerto rico totaling fourth quarter 
capital liquidity capital resources and needs our cash requirements arise principally from the purchase of inventory  capital expenditures related to existing stores  offices and distribution centers  service our debt and contractual obligations 
our fiscal capital expenditures totaled  including the remodeling of stores and the opening of two new supercenters 
our fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be similar to fiscal  including comparable inventory levels 
in fiscal  we received  from the cancellation of certain company owned life insurance policies 
the proceeds from the surrender of these non core assets were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and general corporate purposes 
in fiscal  we repurchased  of pep boys stock and paid an additional  to settle shares purchased in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we prepaid  of debt under our senior secured term loan facility due in with the net proceeds from a sale leaseback transaction on company owned locations 
on or before august   we are obligated to purchase properties that we currently rent under a master operating lease 
we believe that the market value of these properties exceeds their  purchase price  which will allow us to fund such obligation through sale leaseback or other financing transactions 
we anticipate that cash provided by operating activities  our existing line of credit  cash on hand  additional sale leaseback financing transactions  and future access to the capital markets will exceed our expected cash requirement in fiscal our working capital was  at february    at february  and  at january  our long term debt  as a percentage of its total capitalization  was at february   at february  and at january   respectively 
as of february   we had a  line of credit  with an availability of approximately  our current portion of long term debt is  at february  contractual obligations the following chart represents our total contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of february  contractual obligations total due in less than year due in years due in years due after years dollars in thousands long term debt     operating leases     asset purchase obligation under operating lease  expected scheduled interest payments on all long term debt  capital leases and lease finance obligations    capital and lease financing obligations  other long term obligations   total contractual obligations    long term debt  capital leases and lease financing obligations include current maturities 
we have exercised an option to purchase  on or before august   properties that we currently rent under a master operating lease 
we believe that the market value of these properties exceeds their  purchase price  which will allow us to fund such purchase through sale leasebacks or other financing transactions 
primarily includes unfunded pension obligation of  fin liabilities and asset retirement obligations 
we made voluntary contributions of   and  to our pension plans in fiscal  and  respectively 
future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our pension plans 
the above table does not reflect the timing of projected settlements for our recorded asset disposal costs of  and our fin liabilities of  because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of the related cash payments 
commercial commitments total due in less than year due in years due in years due after years dollar amounts in thousands import letters of credit standby letters of credit    surety bonds   purchase obligations    total commercial commitments    our open purchase orders are based on current inventory or operational needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short periods of time 
we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements and generally our open purchase orders orders that have not been shipped are not binding agreements 
those purchase obligations that are in transit from our vendors at february  are considered to be a commercial commitment 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a commercial commitment to purchase approximately  of products over a six year period 
the commitment for years two through five is approximately  per year  while the final year s commitment is approximately half that amount 
following year two  we are obligated to pay the vendor a per unit fee if there is a shortfall between our cumulative purchases during the two year period and the minimum purchase requirement 
for years three through six  we are obligated to pay the vendor a per unit fee for any annual shortfall 
the maximum annual obligation under any shortfall is approximately  at february   we expect to meet the cumulative minimum purchase requirements under this contract 
long term debt senior secured term loan facility due october  on january  we entered into a  senior secured term loan facility due january  this facility is secured by the real property and improvements associated with of our stores 
interest at the rate of london interbank offered rate libor plus on this facility was payable starting in february proceeds from this facility were used to satisfy and discharge our then outstanding  medium term notes due march  and  term enhanced remarketable securities terms due july  and to reduce borrowings under our line of credit by approximately  on october   we amended and restated the senior secured term loan facility to i increase the size from  to  ii extend the maturity from january  to october   iii reduce the interest rate from libor plus to libor plus 
an additional stores bringing the total to stores were added to the collateral pool securing the facility 
proceeds were used to satisfy and discharge  in outstanding convertible senior notes due june  on february   we further amended the senior secured term loan facility to reduce the interest rate from libor plus to libor plus 
on november   we sold the land and buildings for owned properties to an independent third party 
we used  of the net proceeds to prepay a portion of the senior secured term loan facility 
this prepayment reduced the principal amount of the facility to  and reduced the scheduled quarterly repayments from  to  in addition the prepayment resulted in the recognition in interest expense of approximately  of deferred financing fees and the reclassification from other comprehensive loss for the portion of the related interest rate swap that is no longer designated as a hedge 
the number of stores in the collateral pool  which secures the facility  was simultaneously reduced by stores bringing the total remaining collateral to stores with an estimated fair market value of approximately 
senior subordinated notes due december  on december   we issued  aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due december  line of credit agreement due december  on december   we further amended our amended and restated line of credit agreement 
the amendment increased the amount available for borrowings to  with an ability  upon satisfaction of certain conditions  to increase such amount to  the amendment also reduced the interest rate under the agreement to libor plus after june   the rate decreased to libor plus  subject to incremental increases as excess availability falls below 
the amendment also provided the flexibility  upon satisfaction of certain conditions  to release up to  of reserves required as of december  under the line of credit agreement to support certain operating leases 
this reserve was  on february  finally  the amendment extended the term of the agreement through december the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the line of credit agreement was and at february  and february   respectively 
other notes we also have other notes payable with aggregate principal balances of  and  and a weighted average interest rates of and at february  and february   respectively 
these notes mature at various times through august certain of these notes are collateralized by land and buildings with an aggregate carrying value of approximately  and  at february  and february   respectively 
other matters several of the company s debt agreements require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and compliance with covenants 
the most restrictive of these covenants  an ebitda requirement  is triggered if the company s availability under its line of credit agreement drops below  as of february  the company had an additional availability of approximately  under its line of credit  and was in compliance with all covenants contained in its debt agreements 
other contractual obligations in the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into a vendor financing program with an availability of  under this program  our factor made accelerated and discounted payments to our vendors and we  in turn  made our regularly scheduled full vendor payments to the factor 
this program was terminated effective december  as of february  and february   there was an outstanding balance of and  respectively  under this program  classified as trade payable program liability in the consolidated balance sheet 
on june   we entered into a new vendor financing program with an availability up to  there was an outstanding balance of  under this program as of february  we have letter of credit arrangements in connection with our risk management  import merchandising and vendor financing programs 
we were contingently liable for  and  in outstanding import letters of credit and  and  in outstanding standby letters of credit as of february  and february   respectively 
we are also contingently liable for surety bonds in the amount of approximately  and  as of february  and february   respectively 
the surety bonds guarantee certain of our payments for example utilities  easement repairs  licensing requirements and customs fees 
off balance sheet arrangements in the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into a  operating lease for certain operating equipment at an interest rate of libor plus 
we have evaluated this transaction in accordance with the guidance of financial accounting standards board interpretation number fin and re evaluated the transaction under fin r and have determined that the company is not required to consolidate the leasing entity 
as of february   there was an outstanding commitment of  under the lease 
the lease includes a residual value guarantee with a maximum value of approximately  we expect the fair market value of the leased equipment to substantially reduce or eliminate our payment under the residual guarantee at the end of the lease term 
in accordance with fin  we have recorded a liability for the fair value of the guarantee related to this operating lease 
as of february  and february   the current value of this liability was  and  respectively  which is recorded in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
on august   we renegotiated  in operating leases 
these leases  which expire on august   have lease payments with an effective rate of libor plus 
we have evaluated this transaction in accordance with the guidance of fin and re evaluated the transaction under fin r and have determined that the company is not required to consolidate the leasing entity 
we have exercised our option to purchase  on or before august   these properties and expect the fair market value of the leased real estate to exceed the  purchase price 
we expect to fund this obligation through sale leaseback or other financing transactions 
as of february   there was an outstanding commitment of  under the lease 
we lease certain property and equipment under operating leases and lease financings which contain renewal and escalation clauses  step rent provisions  capital improvements funding and other lease concessions 
these provisions are considered in the calculation of our minimum lease payments which are recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the applicable lease term 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 any lease payments that are based upon an existing index or rate are included in our minimum lease payment calculations 
total operating lease commitments as of february  were  pension and retirement plans we have a defined benefit pension plan covering our full time employees hired on or before february  we also have an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan serp that includes a defined benefit portion 
on january   we amended and restated our serp 
this amendment converted the defined benefit portion of the serp to a defined contribution portion for certain unvested participants and all future participants 
all vested participants under the defined benefits portion of the serp continue to accrue benefits according to the previous defined benefit formula 
the expense under these plans for fiscal   and was   and  respectively 
the fiscal expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected return on plan assets of and a discount rate of 
in developing the expected return on asset assumptions  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including their review of asset class return expectations 
the discount rate utilized for the pension plans is based on a model bond portfolio with durations that match the expected payment patterns of the plans 
we continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions and make adjustments as necessary 
in fiscal  we contributed an aggregate of  to our pension plans 
based upon the current funded status of the defined benefit pension plan and the unfunded defined benefit portion of the serp  aggregate cash contributions are expected to be  in fiscal results of operations the following discussion explains the material changes in our results of operations for the fifty two weeks ended february   the fifty three weeks ended february  and fifty two weeks ended january  discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal  we adopted our long term strategic plan 
one of the initial steps in this plan was the identification of low return stores for closure 
immediately prior to their ultimate closure during the fourth quarter of fiscal  these stores were operated as clearance centers 
we are accounting for these store closures in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and sfas no 
accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we recorded charges of  related to store closures which included a  impairment charge to fixed assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our discontinued operations for all periods presented reflect the operating results for of the closed stores because we do not believe that the customers of these stores are likely to become customers of other pep boys stores due to geographical considerations 
discontinued operations for fiscal also reflect pre tax charges of  and  for store closure and impairment of fixed assets  respectively 
the operating results for the other closed stores are included in continuing operations because we believe that the customers of these stores are likely to become customers of other pep boys stores that are in close proximity 
during fiscal  we sold a closed store for proceeds of  resulting in a pre tax gain of  which was recorded in discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of operations 
the following analysis of our results of continuing operations excludes the operating results of the above referenced stores which have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented

gross profit from merchandise sales decreased  as a percentage of merchandise sales  to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease in dollars was  or a decrease from the prior year 
this decrease  as a percentage of merchandise sales  resulted primarily from decreased product margins  higher occupancy costs and higher rent expense offset  in part  by lower warehousing and distribution costs 
the decrease in product margins resulted from recording a  inventory impairment charge associated with the markdown and discontinuance of certain non core products as part of our longer term strategic plan 
occupancy costs increased by  primarily due to the impairment charges of  related to the stores identified for closure that operated as clearance centers during the fourth quarter and rent expense increased by  primarily related to the change in fair value of the cash flow hedge associated with variable lease payments on certain of stores  partially offset by lower equipment rental 
warehousing and distribution costs decreased by  due to a more efficient store replenishment schedule and lower occupancy costs 
gross profit from service revenue increased  as a percentage of service revenue  to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in dollars was  or a increase from the prior year 
this increase as a percentage of service revenue resulted primarily from lower service associate costs positive experience in workers compensation and medical claims of  partially offset by higher service associate compensation expense resulting from increased staffing levels in our service centers and impairment charges of  related to the closed stores

gross profit from merchandise sales increased  as a percentage of merchandise sales  to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in dollars was  or a increase from the prior year 
this increase  as a percentage of merchandise sales  was due to improved product margins and decreased warehousing costs partially offset by higher occupancy costs 
the increase in merchandise margins resulted from the restructuring of our vendor agreements  lower freight costs and lower acquisition costs 
effective january   substantially all of our vendor agreements were restructured to no longer identify specific incremental expenses for cooperative advertising  therefore all vendor support funds are now treated as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as an increase to gross profit from merchandise sales when the inventories are sold  in accordance with eitf gross profit from merchandise sales from fiscal improved by approximately  compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of these changes 
warehousing costs were reduced due to a more efficient store replenishment schedule and the absence in fiscal of certain costs associated with the fiscal relocation of our southern california distribution center 
increased occupancy costs were the result of higher utility costs and higher depreciation expense associated with our store remodel program 
our gross profit classification may not be comparable to the classification used by certain other entities 
some entities including us include distribution  store occupancy  buying and other costs in cost of goods sold 
other entities exclude such costs from gross profit  including them instead in general and administrative and or sales and marketing expenses 
gross profit from service revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in dollars was  or a increase from the prior year 
this increase as a percentage of service revenue was primarily due to lower workers compensation expense and repairs and maintenance costs offset by cost associated with providing free or discounted towing services to our customers 
net gain from disposition of assets increased  as percentage of total revenue to from in fiscal the  increase resulted from the sale of one owned property and the leasehold interest in another in versus the sale of one owned property in selling  general and administrative expenses increased  as a percentage of total revenues  to in fiscal from in fiscal this was a  or increase over the prior year 
this increase  as a percentage of total revenues  was due primarily to higher net media expense offset by reduced general office expense 
the increase in net media expense was caused by a change in our vendor agreements which resulted in a different application of eitf  whereby approximately  in vendor support funds were recorded as a reduction to advertising cost in fiscal see above explanation of vendor agreement restructuring 
general office expense was favorable by  primarily due to incurring a  software impairment charge in fiscal interest expense increased  to  in fiscal from fiscal included in fiscal was  of costs associated with the early satisfaction and discharge of  senior convertible notes due in june  and in fiscal   in interest and fees associated with the early satisfaction and discharge of our  medium term notes and  term enhanced remarketable securities terms

industry comparison we operate in the us automotive aftermarket  which has two general competitive arenas the do it for me difm service labor  installed merchandise and tires market and the do it yourself diy retail merchandise market 
generally  the specialized automotive retailers focus on either the diy or difm areas of the business 
we believe that operation in both the diy and difm areas of the business positively differentiates us from most of our competitors 
although we manage our store performance at a store level in aggregation  we believe that the following presentation shows an accurate comparison against competitors within the two sales arenas 
we compete in the diy area of the business through our retail sales floor and commercial sales business retail sales 
our service center business labor and installed merchandise and tires competes in the difm area of the industry 
the following table presents the revenues and gross profit for each area of the business 
year ended dollar amounts in thousands february  february  january  retail sales    service center revenue    total revenues    gross profit from retail sales    gross profit from service center revenue   total gross profit    excludes revenues from installed products 
includes revenues from installed products 
gross profit from retail sales includes the cost of products sold  buying  warehousing and store occupancy costs 
gross profit from service center revenue includes the cost of installed products sold  buying  warehousing  service center payroll and related employee benefits and service center occupancy costs 
occupancy costs include utilities  rents  real estate and property taxes  repairs and maintenance and depreciation and amortization expenses 
effects of inflation we use the lifo method of inventory valuation 
thus  the cost of merchandise sold approximates current cost 
although we cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on its operations  we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on revenues or results of operations during all fiscal years presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  product returns and warranty obligations  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring costs  retirement benefits  share based compensation  risk participation agreements and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  although not all inclusive we evaluate whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market based on historical experience with the carrying value and life of inventory 
the assumptions used in this evaluation are based on current market conditions and we believe inventory is stated at the lower of cost as determined under lifo or market in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  historically we have been able to return excess items to vendors for credit 
future changes in vendors  in their policies or in their willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require a revision in the estimates 
if our estimates regarding excess or obsolete inventory are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in these estimates at february  would have affected net loss by approximately  for the fiscal year ended february  we have risk participation arrangements with respect to casualty and health care insurance  including the maintaining of stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
a reserve for the liabilities associated with these agreements is established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience 
the amounts included in our costs related to these arrangements are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions  claims experience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at february  would have affected net loss by approximately  for the fiscal year ended february  we record reserves for future product returns  warranty claims and inventory shrinkage 
the reserves are based on current sales of products and historical claims and inventory shrinkage experience 
if actual experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required 
a change in these reserves at february  would have affected net loss by approximately  for the fiscal year ended february  we have significant pension costs and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and merit and promotion increases 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension costs or liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions  assuming all other assumptions remain constant change in assumption impact on annual pension expense impact on projected benefit obligation percentage point decrease in discount rate increase  increase  percentage point increase in discount rate decrease  decrease  decrease in expected rate of return on assets increase  increase in expected rate of return on assets decrease  we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment 
management s judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the time of evaluation 
future events could cause management s conclusion on impairment to change  requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 
we have a share based compensation plan  which includes stock options and restricted stock units  or rsus 
we account for our share based compensation plans as prescribed by the fair value provisions of sfas no 
r 
we determine the fair value of our stock options at the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the rsus are awarded at a price equal to the market price of our underlying stock on the date of the grant 
the pricing model and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include the expected life of stock options  expected stock price volatility  future employee stock option exercise behaviors and the estimate of award forfeitures 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are different from these assumptions  the share based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share based compensation 
in addition  significant changes in these assumptions could materially impact our share based compensation expense on future awards 
a change in our share based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended february  would have affected net loss by approximately  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories  for tax and accounting purposes 
we determine our provision for income taxes based on federal and state tax laws and regulations currently in effect  some of which have been recently revised 
legislation changes currently proposed by certain states in which we operate  if enacted  could increase our transactions or activities subject to tax 
any such legislation that becomes law could result in an increase in our state income tax expense and our state income taxes paid  which could have a material effect on our net earnings loss 
the temporary differences between the book and tax treatment of income and expenses result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in this regard when determining whether or not we should establish a valuation allowance  the company considers various tax planning strategies  including potential real estate transactions  as future taxable income 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a future period  income tax expense will be impacted
