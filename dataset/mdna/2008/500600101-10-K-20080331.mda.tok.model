item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including the risks discussed in item a 
risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition under percentage of completion method  bad debts  inventories  warranty reserves  investment valuations  valuation of stock compensation awards  recoverability of deferred tax assets  liabilities for uncertain tax positions and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are most affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and services rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we do not recognize revenue for products prior to customer acceptance unless we believe the product meets all customer specifications and has a history of consistently achieving customer acceptance of the product 
provisions for product returns and allowances are recorded in the same period as the related revenues 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of product when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and other allowances 
certain product sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing for a limited right of return on unsold products 
sales to distributors are primarily made for sales to the distributors customers and not for stocking of inventory 
we delay revenue recognition for our estimate of distributor claims of right of return on unsold products based upon our historical experience with our products and specific analysis of amounts subject to return based upon discussions with our distributors or their customers 
we recognize revenues from long term research and development contracts on the percentage of completion method of accounting as work is performed  based upon the ratio of costs or hours already incurred to the estimated total cost of completion or hours of work to be performed 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to amounts earned under milestones included in contracts  if such provisions exist 
we account for product development and research contracts that have established prices for distinct phases as if each phase were a separate contract 
we classify amounts earned on contracts in progress that are in excess of amounts billed as unbilled receivables and we classify amounts received in excess of amounts earned as billings in excess of revenues earned 
we invoice based on dates specified in the related agreement or in periodic installments based upon our invoicing cycle 
we recognize the entire amount of an estimated ultimate loss in our financial statements at the time the loss on a contract becomes known 
if our estimate of total contract costs or our determination of whether the customer agrees that a milestone is achieved is incorrect  our revenue could be overstated and profits would be negatively impacted 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make future payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory we provide a reserve for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions and our production plans 
inventories that are obsolete or slow moving are generally fully reserved representing the estimated net realizable value as such information becomes available 
our iii v products are made to each customer s unique specifications and are generally produced upon receipt of a customer order 
the manufacturing time to make our iii v products is less than one day  accordingly our iii v inventory consists primarily of raw material  primarily gallium arsenide wafers  or finished products 
the finished product may be at our facilities or at our customer s facilities under consignment programs 
our display products are manufactured based upon production plans whose critical assumptions include non binding demand forecasts provided by our customers  lead times for raw materials  lead times for wafer foundries to perform circuit processing and yields 
if a customer were to cancel an order or actual demand was lower than forecasted demand  we could not sell the excess iii v inventory and we may not be able to sell the excess display inventory and additional reserves would be required 
if we were unable to sell the excess inventory  we would establish reserves to reduce the inventory to its estimated realizable value generally zero 
investment valuation we hold a minority investment in micrel incorporated  a publicly traded company whose share prices may be highly volatile 
we consider this investment to be available for sale and accordingly account for fluctuations in the value of this investment in accumulated other comprehensive income 
if  however  we were to determine that the fair value of this investment had been other than temporarily impaired  we would be required to charge the loss directly to the statement of operations 
this investment had a fair market value of million at december   which was less than our carrying value at that date  and accordingly we recorded a million charge to the statement of operations to reduce the investment to its fair value 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
when assessing a publicly traded investment for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost  the performance of the investee s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations 
we also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties 
in the event our judgments change as to other than temporary declines in value  we may record an additional impairment loss  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we periodically make equity investments in private companies  accounted for on the cost or equity method  whose values are difficult to determine 
when assessing investments in private companies for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  the share price from the investee s latest financing round  the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan  the investee s revenue and cost trends  the liquidity and cash position  including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee s products and services 
we provide for an impairment valuation if we believe a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the amortization or depreciation period may need to be changed 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated identifiable undiscounted cash flows from such asset are less than its carrying value 
for assets that are to be held and used  impairment is measured based upon the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
if our estimates of anticipated future cash flows or market conditions were incorrect  additional impairment charges may be required 
during we recognized million of impairment charges related to assets held for use or being transferred to the kobrite joint venture 
we did not incur any impairment charges in or product warranty we generally sell products with a limited warranty of product quality and a limited indemnification of customers against intellectual property infringement claims related to our products 
we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   we had a warranty reserve of million  which represents the estimated liabilities for warranty claims in process  potential warranty issues customers have notified us about and an estimate based on historical failure rates 
for the fiscal years  and  our warranty expense was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
if our estimates for warranty claims are incorrect  our revenue could be overstated and profits would be negatively impacted 
income taxes the company has historically incurred domestic operating losses from both a financial reporting and tax return standpoint 
we establish valuation allowances if it appears more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
these judgments are based on our projections of taxable income and the amount and timing of our tax operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
given our federal operating tax loss carryforwards  we do not expect to pay domestic federal taxes in the near term 
it is possible that we could pay domestic alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes 
we are also subject to foreign taxes from our korean subsidiary operations 
our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by tax authorities 
despite our history of operating losses there can be exposures for state taxes  federal alternative minimum taxes or foreign tax that may be due 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
should the actual results differ from our estimates  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
such adjustment could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we also establish valuation allowances when recovery of such net deferred tax assets is not considered more likely than not 
these judgments consider our historical results and forecasts of future results 
because of our history of operating losses  our net operating loss carryforwards have had a full valuation allowance associated with them 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fin 
fin addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authorities 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures 
there was no impact upon the adoption of fin on december  there are no known tax positions which are reasonably possible to change over the next twelve months necessitating a significant change in our unrecognized tax benefits 
stock compensation we estimate the fair value of each stock based award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option valuation model 
the black scholes merton option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility  the expected life of options  a risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
many of these assumptions are highly subjective and require the exercise of management judgment 
our management must also apply judgment in developing an estimate of awards that may be forfeited 
if our actual experience differs significantly from our estimates and we choose to employ different assumptions in the future  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ materially from that recorded in the current period 
such options vest over  in general  over a four year period 
we did not issue any new stock option awards during or  rather we elected to make awards of restricted shares 
these awards are generally valued at the value of the underlying shares on the date they are granted and require us only to estimate forfeiture rates 
results of operations our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in december 
the fiscal year ended december  includes weeks and the fiscal years ended december  and december  each include weeks 
the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  are referred to as fiscal years  and  respectively  herein 
we are a leading developer and manufacturer of advanced semiconductor materials and miniature displays 
we use our proprietary semiconductor material technology to design  manufacture and market our iii v and cyberdisplay products for use in highly demanding commercial wireless communications and high resolution portable consumer electronic applications 
our products enable our customers to develop and market an improved generation of products for these target applications 
we have two principal sources of revenues product revenues and research and development revenues 
product revenues consist of sales of our iii v products  principally gallium arsenide gaas hbt transistor wafers  and cyberdisplay products 
research and development revenues consist primarily of development contracts with agencies of the us government 
research and development revenues were million  or of revenues  million  or of total revenues and million  or of total revenues in kowon  our korean subsidiary and one of our reportable segments  provides to us back end packaging services related to our cyberdisplay products as well as selling displays to other customers 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
our revenues  which include product sales and amounts earned from research and development contracts  for fiscal years and  were as follows revenues iii v cyberdisplay total the decrease in our iii v revenues resulted from a net increase in unit demand for our hbt transistor wafers from customers that use them in wireless handset applications  which was partially off set by price declines of our hbt products and a decline in our cyberlite revenues  which were million for the year ended our cyberlite revenues declined because we sold the product line to the kobrite joint venture in the increase in display revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted from an increase in sales of our cyberdisplay products to customers that use them for digital still camera applications and military applications 
display revenues for consumer and military applications for and were as follows cyberdisplay revenues by category consumer electronic applications military application eyewear application research development total revenues of our korean subsidiary  kowon  are included in cyberdisplay revenues and are primarily to us and samsung electronics for camcorder applications 
kowon s revenues increased as a result of demand from us to support our increased sales of displays to customers that use them for digital still camera applications 
revenues of kowon were as follows for and cyberdisplay revenues by segement kopin us revenues kowon revenues to other customers kowon revenues kowon sales to kopin total cyberdisplay revenues based on current discussions with our customers and certain contractual obligations  we expect the prices of certain of our products to decline in fiscal year we anticipate the average selling price of our hbt transistor wafers and display products sold to customers for consumer electronics applications will decline approximately to during fiscal year relative to the overall increase or decrease in the average sales price of our display products will be dependent on the sales mix of commercial and military display sales 
for the company anticipates revenues will be between million and million 
we currently manufacture and sell hbt wafers on either four or six inch gaas 
we believe the industry will migrate to six inch wafers over the next several years 
our largest customer  who accounted for approximately of our total revenues see item a  risk factors for explanation of percent of revenue calculation  purchases our hbt products on four inch gaas wafers and we expect this customer will eventually migrate to using six inch gaas wafers in its manufacturing process 
if we are unable to get the new reactors and our other reactors qualified by our largest and other customers or if we are able to get the reactor qualified but can not manufacture the quantity our customers require or can not manufacture on six inch gaas wafers in a cost effective manner  our revenues and results of operations could decline significantly 
our purchase and supply agreement with our largest hbt transistor wafer customer  who accounted for approximately of our total revenues  terminates in july we are currently renegotiating this agreement  however  if we are unable to renew this agreement or we renew it on less favorable terms our revenue and results of operations may decline 
international sales represented and of product revenues for fiscal years and respectively 
the increase in international sales is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of our cyberdisplay products for digital still camera applications to asian customers 
international sales are primarily sales of cyberdisplay products to consumer electronic manufacturers primarily located in japan  korea and china 
our international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
in addition  sales of our cyberdisplay products in korea are transacted through our korean subsidiary  kowon technology co  ltd 
kowon s sales are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  kowon s local operating costs are primarily denominated in korean won 
kowon also holds us dollars in order to pay various expenses 
as a result  our financial position and results of operations are subject to exchange rate fluctuation in transactional and functional currency 
we have not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations  because of the historically stable exchange rate between the japanese yen  korean won and the us dollar 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenue in millions cost of product revenue as a of revenues cost of product revenues  which is comprised of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to our products  increased approximately million or from to our gross margin is affected by sales price declines of our products  changes in raw material prices  unit volume of sales  manufacturing efficiencies and the mix of products sold 
as discussed above our sales prices historically decline on an annual basis 
our strategy to offset the impact of the sales price declines has been to increase the unit volume of sales  improve manufacturing efficiencies and increase the sales of products which have higher margins  specifically military products 
our overhead costs and  to a lesser extent  our labor costs are normally stable and do not fluctuate significantly during a three or twelve month period 
essentially  we consider labor and overhead costs to be fixed in nature over the short term and therefore profitability is based on the amount of variable margin we can generate to cover these fixed costs 
variable margin is the product of the number of units sold and the difference between a unit s selling price and its material cost 
gross margins declined in  as compared to  because of a decline in the average unit selling prices of our iii v and display products as compared to and the impact of an increase in displays sold for digital still camera applications which are sold at a price which generates a small or negative variable margin 
there are a number of different display technologies which can produce displays in small form factors 
we believe one of the benefits of our display technology is the ability to produce high resolution displays in small form factors 
the camcorder and digital still camera markets are mature and the majority of these devices use low resolution display products which results in our having limited  if any  competitive advantage over our competitors and therefore the ability to sell displays into these markets is very price dependent 
accordingly for us to generate display revenues with above average gross margins  we will need to increase sales to customers who buy our higher resolution display products  such as the military  or develop new categories such as eyewear 
as we discussed above we expect the sales prices of our products to decline in the future 
in addition  we installed a new manufacturing line for our displays and new mocvd reactors to manufacture our hbt products 
these capital equipment investments will increase our depreciation expense by approximately million in if we are unable to sell higher margin products  primarily displays for military applications  reduce raw material cost or increase manufacturing efficiencies to offset the effects of lower sales price and higher depreciation expense our gross margins will decline 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses are incurred in support of internal display and iii v product development programs or programs funded by agencies of the us government and commercial partners 
r d revenues associated with funded programs are presented separately in revenue in the statement of operations 
research and development costs include staffing  purchases of materials and laboratory supplies  circuit design costs  fabrication and packaging of display products  and overhead 
for fiscal years and r d expense was as follows in millions research and development expense funded internal total funded r d expense decreased in as compared to the prior year primarily because of a decrease in funded programs from the us military 
the increase in internal research and development expenses was primarily attributed to cost to develop our inch display and mocvd iii v manufacturing lines 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses  and administrative and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense as a of revenues the decrease in s  g a expenses in versus is attributable to a decrease of approximately million for professional fees associated with the stock option practice investigation and the restatement of our historical financial statements partially offset by increases in allowances for accounts receivable of million 
total professional fees for the stock option review were million and million in and  respectively 
we would anticipate that these fees would decrease in  however there is pending litigation associated with the stock option review and we expect to continue to incur associated legal fees in excess of historical amounts 
in fiscal year  we issued  restricted stock awards  respectively  to certain of our employees 
each award requires the employee to fulfill certain obligations including continued employment with us for periods of either two or four years the restriction period 
in connection with the issuance of the awards  we recorded deferred compensation expenses of million for which are amortized over the restriction period  or earlier if the vesting accelerates due to meeting performance conditions 
other income and expense 
other income and expense other income and expense in includes interest and miscellaneous income of million  million of foreign exchange gains  million for the other than temporary impairment charge of our investment in micrel and million of miscellaneous bank fees and other expense 
other income and expense for includes interest and miscellaneous income of million  million of gain on the sale of micrel stock  million of foreign exchange losses and of miscellaneous bank fees and other expense 
minority interest in income loss of subsidiary 
we own approximately of the equity of kowon technology co 
ltd 
kowon 
minority interest on the consolidated statement of operations represents the portion of the results of operations of kowon which is allocated to the shareholders of the approximately of kowon not owned by us 
the change in the minority interest in loss income of subsidiary is the result of the change in the results of operations of kowon 
the change in the results of operations of kowon from to was due to increased sales volume of displays to us to support the increase in sales for digital still camera applications 
equity loss in unconsolidated affiliate consists of our approximate share of the losses of kobrite totaling million in and million in tax provision benefit 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal years ended represents alternative minimum taxes owed to us federal and state taxing authorities of million and foreign taxes on the income of our subsidiary kowon of million 
the benefit for income taxes for fiscal year represents the reversal of tax contingencies due to the expiration of the statute of limitations of million  a tax benefit from a loss carryback of million offset by alternative minimum taxes of million and the provision of a valuation allowance on our foreign deferred tax assets of million 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
our revenues  which include product sales and amounts earned from research and development contracts  for fiscal years and  were as follows revenues iii v cyberdisplay total the increase in our iii v revenues resulted from a net increase in unit demand for our hbt transistor wafers from customers that use them in wireless handset applications  which was partially off set by price declines of our hbt products and a decline in our cyberlite revenues  which were million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
our cyberlite revenues declined because we transferred the product line to the kobrite joint venture discussed above 
the decrease in display revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted from a decline in sales of our cyberdisplay products to customers that use them for camcorder applications partially offset by an increase in military application sales 
for we had anticipated that sales of our displays to customers who buy our displays for camcorder applications would decrease as compared to the prior year but this would be partially offset by an increase in sales to customers who purchased our displays for military applications as compared to the prior year 
although the sales of our displays to customers for camcorder applications did decline in  shipments of our displays to customers for military applications occurred sporadically during the year as our customers worked to get their products qualified with the us military and therefore sales of our products for military applications was lower than we anticipated 
in addition  sales of our displays for use in consumer electronic applications were lower than in display revenues for consumer and military applications for and were as follows cyberdisplay revenues by category consumer electronic applications military application eyewear application research development total revenues of our korean subsidiary  kowon  are included in cyberdisplay revenues and are primarily to us and samsung electronics for camcorder applications 
kowon s sales declined as a result of lesser demand from camcorder customers 
kowon s sales for and were as follows cyberdisplay revenues by segement kopin usa revenues kowon revenues to other customers kowon revenues kowon sales to kopin total cyberdisplay revenues based on current discussions with our customers and certain contractual obligations  we expect the prices of certain of our products to decline in fiscal year and we anticipate the average selling price of our hbt transistor wafers and display products sold to customers for consumer electronics applications will decline approximately to during fiscal year relative to and the overall increase or decrease in the average sales price of our display will be dependent on the sales mix of commercial and military display sales 
during fiscal year  we acquired metal organic chemical vapor deposition mocvd reactors  which can produce our hbt products on either four or six inch gallium arsenide gaas wafers 
however  we acquired the reactors primarily for their ability to process six inch gaas wafers 
we currently have other reactors which also can manufacture hbts using either four or six inch gaas wafers and we sell hbt products on both four and six inch gaas wafers 
we believe the industry will migrate to six inch wafers over the next several years 
our largest customer  who accounted for approximately of our total revenues see item a  risk factors for explanation of percent of revenue calculation  purchases our hbt products on four inch gaas wafers and we expect this customer will migrate to using six inch gaas wafers in its manufacturing process 
if we are unable to get the new reactors and our other reactors qualified by our largest and other customers or if we are able to get the reactor qualified but can not manufacture the quantity our customers require or can not manufacture on six inch gaas wafers in a cost effective manner  our revenues and results of operations could decline significantly 
our purchase and supply agreement with our largest hbt transistor wafer customer terminates in july we are currently renegotiating this agreement  however  if we are unable to renew this agreement or we renew it on less favorable terms our revenue and results of operations may decline 
international sales represented and of revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in international sales is primarily attributable to increase in domestic sales of our hbt products and military sales of our display products and a decrease in our international cyberdisplay sales for camcorder applications and our cyberlite led sales 
international sales are primarily sales of cyberdisplay products to consumer electronic manufacturers primarily located in japan  korea and china and cyberlite led sales to japan and china 
our international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  a strengthening of the us dollar increases the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
in addition  sales of our cyberdisplay products in korea are transacted through our korean subsidiary  kowon 
kowon s sales are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  kowon s local operating costs are primarily denominated in korean won 
kowon also holds us dollars in order to pay various expenses 
as a result  our financial position and results of operations are subject to exchange rate fluctuation in transactional and functional currency 
we have not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations  because of the historically stable exchange rate between the japanese yen  korean won and the us dollar 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenue in millions cost of product revenue as a of revenues cost of product revenues  which is comprised of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to our products  decreased approximately million or from to cost of sales of cyberlite products for fiscal year was million for fiscal year and for fiscal year as we had no sales of cyberlite in our gross margin is affected by sales price declines of our products  changes in raw material prices  unit volume of sales  manufacturing efficiencies and the mix of products sold 
as discussed above our sales prices historically decline on an annual basis 
our strategy to offset the impact of the sales price declines has been to increase the unit volume of sales  improve manufacturing efficiencies and increase the sales of products which have higher margins  specifically military products 
our overhead costs and  to a lesser extent  our labor costs are normally stable and do not fluctuate significantly during a three or twelve month period

gross margins declined in  as compared to  because of a decline in the average unit selling prices of our iii v and display products as compared to and the impact of the decline in display unit sales in  while the costs of labor and overhead remained approximately the same as research and development 
research and development expenses r d are incurred in support of internal display and iii v product development programs or programs funded by agencies of the us government and commercial partners 
research and development costs include staffing  purchases of materials and laboratory supplies  circuit design costs  fabrication and packaging of display products  and overhead 
for fiscal years and  r d expense was as follows in millions research and development expense funded internal total funded r d expense decreased in as compared to the prior year primarily because of the discontinuance of light emitting diode research in which was partially offset by an increase in r d expenses for military programs 
for fiscal funded r d included million to support the kobrite joint venture 
internal research and development expenses were million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in internal research and development expenses was primarily attributed to the lower development cost for our cyberlite products offset by development efforts for iii v and display products 
during fiscal year  we spent approximately million  including allocated overhead  on cyberlite led research and development costs

cumulative effect of accounting change 
as of december   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 

this interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an assets retirement when the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the impact of adopting fin was to record a cumulative effect of accounting change charge of million to recognize the accumulated depreciation as of the date of adoption related to the obligation for restoration of facilities leased by the company 
total obligations as of december  are estimated to be million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and equivalents and marketable debt securities of million and working capital of million compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  the decrease in cash and equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to cash used in operating activities of million and capital expenditures of million 
our marketable debt securities have not been significantly impacted as of december  from the recent issues experienced in the credit markets 
in december  we amended a purchase and supply agreement with a significant hbt customer that now expires in july  excluding a last time buy option contained in the agreement 
under the terms of this agreement we have agreed to maintain capacity levels for manufacturing hbt wafers and we committed to a pricing schedule under certain circumstances 
the agreement also requires us to give prior notice if we exit our hbt product line 
in consideration for this agreement the customer agreed to source of its hbt wafer needs from us subject to the customer s right to source hbt wafers from other sources if we are unable to meet their requirements under certain circumstances 
we agreed that failure to meet our supply obligations under the agreement would allow our customer to obtain court ordered specific performance and if we do not perform we could then be liable for monetary damages up to a maximum of million 
we lease facilities located in taunton and westborough  massachusetts  and scotts valley  california  under non cancelable operating leases 
we have two taunton facilities  one whose lease expires in and the other in the taunton lease expires in and may be extended twice for individual year terms 
the westborough and scotts valley leases expire in we expect to expend between and million on capital expenditures over the next twelve months  primarily for the acquisition of equipment to increase capacity in our iii v product line and implement the production line for our cyberdisplay products 
as of december   we had substantial tax loss carry forwards  which may be used to offset future federal taxable income 
we may be subject to alternative minimum taxes  foreign taxes and state income taxes depending on our taxable income and sources of taxable income 
we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of our equity securities 
we believe our available cash resources will support our operations and capital needs for at least the next twelve months
