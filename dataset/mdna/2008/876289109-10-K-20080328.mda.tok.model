the buffalo group on december   we entered into a definitive stock and asset purchase agreement to acquire certain assets and entities comprising the buffalo group 
the buffalo group designs  imports and sells contemporary branded apparel and accessories  primarily in canada and the united states 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we and our subsidiaries agreed to acquire all the outstanding capital stock of four principal operating subsidiaries of the buffalo group buffalo inc  canada inc  canada inc and buffalo corporation  and certain assets  consisting primarily of intellectual property rights and licenses  from the buffalo trust  for a total aggregate purchase price of up to approximately million 
at signing of the purchase agreement  we delivered million to the sellers as a deposit against the purchase price payable under the agreement 
on april   we entered into a mutual termination and release agreement with the buffalo group  pursuant to which we and the other parties to the purchase agreement mutually agreed to terminate the purchase agreement 
the parties determined that it was in the mutual best interest of each party to terminate the proposed agreement 
under the terms of the mutual termination and release agreement  buffalo agreed to return to us  of the  deposit previously provided by us to the buffalo group pursuant to the purchase agreement  and the parties have released each other from any claims arising under or related to the purchase agreement 
the million deposit was previously recorded in other assets in consolidated balance sheets 
we received  in april the remaining portion of the deposit of  and other due diligence fees incurred in the acquisition process were recorded as terminated acquisition expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the first quarter of notes receivable related party reserve in connection with the sale in of our assets and real property in mexico  the purchasers of the mexico assets  solticio  sa de sa solticio  and acabados y cortes textiles  sa de sa acotex  issued us unsecured promissory notes of  that matured on november  and secured promissory notes of  with payments due on december  and every year thereafter until december  the secured notes were secured by the real and personal property in mexico that we sold to the purchasers 
as of september   the outstanding balance of the notes and interest receivables was million prior to the reserve 
historically  we had placed orders for purchases of fabric from the purchasers pursuant to the purchase commitment agreement we entered into at the time of the sale of the mexico assets  and we had satisfied our payment obligations for the fabric by offsetting the amounts payable against the amounts due to us under the notes 
however  during the third quarter of  the purchasers ceased providing fabric and were not making payments under the notes 
we further evaluated the recoverability of the notes receivable and recorded a loss on the notes receivable in the third quarter of in an amount equal to the outstanding balance less the value of the underlying assets securing the notes 
the loss was estimated to be approximately million  resulting in a net notes receivable balance at september  of approximately million 
we believe there was no significant change subsequently on the value of the underlying assets securing the notes  therefore  we did not have additional reserve after the third quarter of on march   our wholly owned subsidiary  tarrant luxembourg sarl  entered into a letter agreement with solticio  inmobiliaria cuadros  sa de sa inmobiliaria  and acotex  acotex and together with solticio and inmobiliaria  the sellers  and tavex algodonera  sa tavex  which was subsequently amended 
pursuant to the agreement  as amended  tavex had the right and option but not an obligation  at any time on or prior to september   to pay to tarrant luxembourg an aggregate of us million in cash  whereupon  among other things  tarrant luxembourg would terminate the solticio and acotex promissory notes described above and release the sellers from any further obligations thereunder  and terminate and release all liens on the collateral securing those notes 
on august   we received a payment of million from tavex upon the exercise by tavex of its option in accordance with the agreement among the parties 
in return for the tavex s payment of million  we have taken the following actions in accordance with the terms of the agreement o tarrant luxembourg terminated the solticio and acotex promissory notes described above and released the sellers from any further obligations thereunder  and terminated and released all liens on the collateral securing those notes  o tarrant luxembourg and the sellers terminated all other executory obligations among the parties  including any obligation of ours to purchase fabric from soliticio and acotex  and o tarrant luxembourg agreed to purchase from tavex at least us million of fabric prior to the end of  and tarrant luxembourg agreed to deliver an irrevocable letter of credit for the full purchase price 
upon closing of the transaction and receiving the payment of million  we recorded a gain of million on our consolidated statements of operations as other income in the third quarter of we placed a fabric order with tavex on august  for million pursuant to the agreement 
at december   the irrevocable letter of credit expired and we did not have any further commitment to purchase fabric from tavex 
credit facility in june  we entered into a new million credit facility with guggenheim corporate funding  llc as administrative and collateral agent for certain lenders and expanded our existing facilities with gmac commercial finance credit  llc from million to million and dbs bank hong kong limited from million to million 
the credit facility with guggenheim consisted of an initial term loan of million  of which million was advanced at the initial closing 
a second term loan of up to million was available to finance acquisitions acceptable to guggenheim as agent 
on september   we repaid in full the term loan of million outstanding under the guggenheim credit facility 
in november  we executed a payoff letter with guggenheim and the lenders  which released all liens held by guggenheim and the lenders 
internal revenue service audit in january  the internal revenue service irs completed its examination of our federal income tax returns for the years ended december  through the irs had proposed adjustments to increase our income tax payable for the six years under examination 
in addition  in july  the irs initiated an examination of our federal income tax return for the year ended december  in december  we received a final assessment from the irs of million for the years ended december  through  and in the first quarter of  we entered into a final settlement agreement with the irs 
under the settlement  which totals million  including million of interest  we agreed to pay the irs million in march and an additional  per month until repayment in full 
the settlement with the irs is within amounts accrued for as of december  in our financial statements  and we therefore do not anticipate the settlement to result in any additional charges to income other than interest on the outstanding balance 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we are required to make assumptions about matters  which are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material effect on our financial condition or result of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to allowance for returns  discounts and bad debts  inventory  notes receivable related parties reserve  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  accrued expenses  income taxes  stock options valuation  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
in addition  we are periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and will not be known for prolonged period of time 
we believe our financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and provide a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable allowance for returns  discounts and bad debts we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable and chargebacks disputes from the customer based upon a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit sources  a specific reserve for bad debts is taken against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts and uncollectible chargebacks based on our historical collection experience 
if collection experience deteriorates for example  due to an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
as of december   the balance of the allowance for returns  discounts and bad debts was million  compared to million at december  inventory our inventories are stated valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
under certain market conditions  we use estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory to properly value inventory 
inventory adjustments are made for the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value and charged to operations in the period in which the facts that give rise to the adjustments become known 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the need for impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill with a fair value based test on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following o a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o a significant change in the manner of the use of the acquired asset or the strategy for the overall business  or o a significant negative industry or economic trend 
we utilized the discounted cash flow methodology to estimate fair value 
at december   we had a goodwill balance of million  and a net property and equipment balance of million  as compared to a goodwill balance of million and a net property and equipment balance of million at december  during the years ended december  and  we did not recognize any impairment related to goodwill and property and equipment 
foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of our hong kong subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date  income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
the functional currency in which we transact business in hong kong is the hong kong dollar 
at december   we had one open foreign exchange forward contract with a maturity of less than one year 
hedge ineffectiveness resulted in a loss totaling  during at december   we had no open foreign exchange forward contracts 
hedge ineffectiveness resulted in a gain of  during transaction gains or losses  other than inter company debt deemed to be of a long term nature  are included in net income loss in the period in which they occur 
foreign currency gains and losses resulting from translation of assets and liabilities related to our hong kong subsidiaries were insignificant in and revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the point of shipment for all merchandise sold based on fob shipping point 
for merchandise shipped on landed duty paid or ldp terms  revenue is recognized at the point of either leaving customs for direct shipments or at the point of leaving our warehouse where title is transferred  net of an estimate of returned merchandise and discounts 
customers are allowed the rights of return or non acceptance only upon receipt of damaged products or goods with quality different from shipment samples 
we do not undertake any after sale warranty or any form of price protection 
we often arrange  on behalf of manufacturers  for the purchase of fabric from a single supplier 
we have the fabric shipped directly to the cutting factory and invoice the factory for the fabric 
generally  the factories pay us for the fabric with offsets against the price of the finished goods 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
sfas no 
r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees for periods beginning in fiscal in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
relating to sfas no 
r 
we have applied the provisions of sab no 
in our adoption of sfas no 
r 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year our financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no

stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r during the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
basic and dilutive earnings per share for the year ended december  were decreased by from to by the additional stock based compensation recognized 
basic and dilutive earnings per share for the year ended december  were decreased by from to by the additional stock based compensation recognized 
the fair value of each option granted to employees and directors is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in  and weighted average volatility factors of the expected market price of our common stock of for  for and for  weighted average risk free interest rates of for  for and to for  dividend yield of for  and  and weighted average expected life of the options of years for  years for and years to years for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we record a substantial valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding us federal tax issues that are currently unresolved  based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that amounts are properly accrued for 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we will record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in any period we determine that the original estimate of a tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current tax matters 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that results in a tax benefit 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  income statement classification of interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized no material adjustment for unrecognized tax benefits but reduced retained earnings as of january  by approximately million attributable to penalties accrued as a component of income tax payable 
as of the date of adoption  our unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately million 
we and several of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the us  hong kong  luxembourg  mexico and various state jurisdictions 
we are currently subject to an audit by the state of new york for the years to  but are not currently being audited by other states or subject to non us income tax jurisdictions for years open in those taxing jurisdictions 
in january  the irs completed its examination of our federal income tax returns for the years ended december  through the irs had proposed adjustments to increase our income tax payable for these years under examination 
in addition  in july  the irs initiated an examination of our federal income tax return for the year ended december  in december  we received a final assessment from the irs of million for the years ended december  through  and in the first quarter of  we entered into a final settlement agreement with the irs 
under the settlement  which totals million  including million of interest  we agreed to pay the irs million in march  and an additional  per month until repayment in full 
the settlement with the irs is within amounts accrued for as of december  in our financial statements  and we therefore do not anticipate the settlement to result in any additional charges to income other than interest on the outstanding balance 
due to the negotiated settlement  we reclassified the irs and state tax liabilities from uncertain tax position to current payable on december  the total unrecognized tax benefits as of january  were million  excluding interest  penalties and related income tax benefits and would be recorded as a component of income tax expense if recognized 
we recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties as a component of income tax expense 
as of january   the accrued interest and penalties were million and million  respectively  excluding any related income tax benefits 
during  we de recognized a previous uncertain tax position through negotiations with the state tax jurisdiction 
the negotiated settlement resulted in a decrease of million in unrecognized tax benefits and million in penalties 
during  we also de recognized a previous uncertain tax position through settlement with the irs 
the negotiated settlement resulted in a decrease of million in unrecognized tax benefits 
after the above adjustments  there was no unrecognized tax benefit as of december  as of december   the accrued interest and penalties were million and  respectively 
in many cases  the uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities 
federal and state statutes are open from through the present period 
hong kong statutes are open from  luxembourg from and mexico from debt covenants our debt agreements require certain covenants including a minimum level of ebitda and specified tangible net worth  and required interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if our results of operations erode and we are not able to obtain waivers from the lenders  the debt would be in default and callable by our lenders 
in addition  due to cross default provisions in our debt agreements  substantially all of our long term debt would become due in full if any of the debt is in default 
in anticipation of us not being able to meet the required covenants due to various reasons  we either negotiate for changes in the relative covenants or an advance waiver or reclassify the relevant debt as current 
we also believe that our lenders would provide waivers if necessary 
however  our expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with other debt covenants cannot be assured and our lenders actions are not controllable by us 
if projections of future operating results are not achieved and the debt is placed in default  we would be required to reduce our expenses  including by curtailing operations  and to raise capital through the sale of assets  issuance of equity or otherwise  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we were in violation of the ebitda and tangible net worth covenants and waivers of the defaults were obtained in march from our lenders 
derivative activities warrant derivatives sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires measurement of certain derivative instruments at their fair value for accounting purposes 
in determining the appropriate fair value  we use the black scholes model 
derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end  with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in consolidated statements of operations as adjustment to fair value of derivative 
at december   there was an income of  recorded as adjustment to fair value of derivative on our consolidated statements of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements foreign currency forward contract we source our products in a number of countries throughout the world  as a result  are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases of materials in the normal course of business 
we utilize derivative financial instruments consisting primarily of forward currency contracts 
these instruments are intended to protect against exposure related to financing transactions and income from international operations 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we may enter into certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not meet hedge accounting criteria 
sfas no 
requires measurement of certain derivative instruments at their fair value for accounting purposes 
all derivative instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value  as a result  we mark to market all derivative instruments 
derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end  with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in consolidated statements of operations as adjustment to fair value of derivative 
during the year ended december   we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain inter company financing transactions 
this transaction is undesignated and as such an ineffective hedge 
at december   we had one open foreign exchange forward contract which has a maturity of less than one year

as is typical for us  quarterly total net sales fluctuated significantly because our customers typically place bulk orders with us  and a change in the number of orders shipped in any one period may have a material effect on the total net sales for that period 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  at december  we significantly strengthened our balance sheet and improved our liquidity in the sale of all our mexico assets for cash enabled us to repay our most expensive loans and as a result our financing cost has since substantially decreased 
the irs settlement and installment repayment plan has removed a significant uncertainty in our financial condition which we have operated under for the past several years 
our liquidity requirements arise from the funding of our working capital needs  principally inventory  finished goods shipments in transit  work in process and accounts receivable  including receivables from our contract manufacturers that relate primarily to fabric we purchase for use by those manufacturers 
our primary sources for working capital and capital expenditures are cash flow from operations  borrowings under our bank and other credit facilities  issuance of long term debt  sales of equity and debt securities  and vendor financing 
in the near term  we expect that our operations and borrowings under bank and other credit facilities will provide sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses  capital expenditures and interest payments on our debt 
in the long term  we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long term liabilities 
our liquidity is dependent  in part  on customers paying on time 
any abnormal chargebacks or returns may affect our source of short term funding 
any changes in credit terms given to major customers may have an impact on our cash flow 
suppliers credit is another major source of short term financing and any adverse changes in their terms will have negative impact on our cash flow 
other principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include o deterioration of sales due to weakness in the markets in which we sell our products  o decreases in market prices for our products  o increases in costs of raw materials  o loss of rights to the american rag cie trademark if litigation in which are involved is resolved in a matter unfavorable to us  and o changes in our working capital requirements 
principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include o financial covenants contained in our current or future bank and debt facilities  and o volatility in the market price of our common stock or in the stock markets in general 
certain of our private brands product lines are generally associated with higher selling  general and administrative expenses  due to significant design  development  and marketing costs compared to our private label business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of doing business in foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  we bear the risk of exchange rate gains and losses that may result in the future 
at times we use forward exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations of foreign currencies on purchases and commitments 
these short term assets and commitments are principally related to trade payables positions 
at december   we had no open foreign exchange forward contracts 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we actively evaluate the creditworthiness of the financial institutions that are counter parties to derivative financial instruments  and we do not expect any counter parties to fail to meet their obligations 
interest rate risk 
because our obligations under our various credit agreements bear interest at floating rates  we are sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates 
any major increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect our financial instruments would have a material impact on earning or cash flows during the next fiscal year 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect interest paid on our debt 
a majority of our credit facilities are at variable rates 
as of december   we had  of fixed rate borrowings and million of variable rate borrowings outstanding 
as of december   we had million of fixed rate borrowings and million of variable rate borrowings outstanding 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of approximately  and  on our variable rate borrowings for and  respectively
