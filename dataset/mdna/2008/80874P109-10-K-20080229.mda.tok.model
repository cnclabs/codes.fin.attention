includes approximately  of items identified during the initial adoption of the sarbanes oxley act of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary to present a better understanding of the overall business of scientific games corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries together  we  we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with an overview of our business and major operating segments  including any significant events that have occurred in the periods presented 
we then provide a discussion of our critical accounting policies  including revenue recognition policies requiring critical judgment  our policies for accounting for share based payment  our valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  our income tax methodology and the use of estimates and assumptions throughout our financial results 
next  we discuss our results of operations  presenting first an overall view of the financial results of the business as a whole  followed by additional discussion of our operating segments 
we then review our financial condition  explaining changes in our balance sheet and cash flows  along with our outstanding debt  contractual obligations and commitments 
next we discuss the existence of any new accounting pronouncements and their impact on our financial statements 
our results may vary significantly from period to period depending on the addition or disposition of business units in each period 
the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in scientific games latin america sa in april  the acquisition of most of the online lottery assets of essnet in march  the acquisitions of shoreline and global draw and certain related companies in april  the acquisitions of games media and ilc in december and the acquisition of ogt in may affect the comparability of operations from period to period 
in addition  the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment in affects the comparability of operations from to the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year traditionally comprise the weakest season for our diversified gaming segment 
as a result of inclement weather during the winter months  a number of racetracks do not operate and those that do operate often experience missed racing days 
this adversely affects the amounts wagered and our corresponding service revenues 
additionally  the fourth quarter is the weakest quarter for global draw due to reduced wagering during the holiday season 
wagering and lottery equipment sales and software license revenues usually reflect a limited number of large transactions  which do not recur on an annual basis 
consequently  revenues and operating results of our lottery systems group can vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of revenue recognition for major equipment sales and software licensing transactions 
in addition  printed products sales may vary depending on the season and timing of contract awards  changes in customer budgets  inventory ticket levels  lottery retail sales and general economic conditions 
background we operate primarily in three business segments printed products group  lottery systems group and diversified gaming group 
our revenues consist of two major components services revenues and sales revenues 
printed products group we provide instant tickets and related services 
instant ticket and related services include ticket design and manufacturing as well as value added services  including game design  sales and marketing support  inventory management and warehousing and fulfillment services 
additionally  this division provides lotteries with over licensed brand products  including deal or no deal  major league baseball  nascar  mandalay bay  national basketball association  harley davidson  wheel of fortune  monopoly  corvette and world poker tour 
this division also includes promotional instant tickets and pull tab tickets that we sell to both lottery and non lottery customers 
we are a worldwide manufacturer of prepaid phone cards  which entitle cellular phone users to a defined value of airtime 
prepaid phone cards offer consumers a cost effective way to purchase cellular airtime  without requiring phone companies to extend credit or consumers to commit to contracts 
prepaid phone cards utilize the secure process that we employ in the production of instant lottery tickets 
this helps to ensure integrity and reliability of the product  thus providing consumers in more than countries with access to prepaid cellular phone service 
on may   we acquired ogt 
ogt is a manufacturer of instant lottery tickets and operates three instant ticket plants located in montreal  canada  sydney  australia and san antonio  texas 
during the fourth quarter of  we closed our instant ticket printing plant in san antonio  texas as part of our ongoing integration efforts related to our purchase of ogt 
during the third quarter of  we made a strategic business decision to rationalize our global printed products group operations during the fourth quarter of as a result  during the year ended december   we recorded impairment charges of approximately million primarily related to long lived assets in peru and fixed assets in germany 
the impairment charge is reported in our printed products segment and is included in depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter  we entered an agreement to sell our interest in the lottery business in peru and recorded charges of approximately million related to business and legal costs related to the sale  and we incurred million of reduction in force charges in germany  which charges are included in selling  general and administrative expense

effective february   we sold our racing communications business and its interest in nasrin  our data communications business  to roberts communications network  llc rcn in exchange for a interest in the rcn consolidated business 
rcn provides communications services to racing and non racing customers using both satellite and terrestrial services 
since the date of acquisition  our share of the earnings of rcn is reflected in the caption equity in income loss of joint ventures in the consolidated statements of operations 
our carrying value in rcn is reflected in the caption other assets and investments in our consolidated balance sheets 
the acquisition of the interest in rcn was not material to our operations 
critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
as described below  the determination of when to recognize revenue for certain revenue transactions requires judgment 
revenue from licensed branded property coupled with a service component whereby we purchase and distribute merchandise prized on behalf of the lottery authorities to identified winners is recognized on a proportional performance method as this method best reflects the pattern in which the obligations to customer are fulfilled 
a performance measure is used based on total estimated cost allocated to a specific contract 
by accumulating costs for services as they are incurred  and dividing such costs by the total contract costs which is estimated based on a budget prior to contract inception  a percentage is determined 
the percentage determined is applied to the total fixed price of the contract and that proportionate amount of revenue is recognized on a monthly basis 
revenue from the sale of lottery and pari mutuel systems that require the production and delivery of terminals and customized software is recognized using cost to cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of our products 
estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
revenues under percentage of completion contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and  to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
business combinations in accounting for business combinations  we apply the accounting requirements of sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  which requires us to record the net assets of acquired businesses at fair value 
in developing estimates of fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities  we analyze a variety of factors including market data  estimated future cash flows of the acquired operations  industry growth rates  current replacement cost for fixed assets  and market rate assumptions for contractual obligations 
changes to the assumptions used to estimate fair value could materially affect the recorded amounts for acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including but not limited to  property  plant and equipment  customer lists  goodwill  and deferred income taxes 
significant changes to the recorded amounts could have a material impact on our future operating results  including changes in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from higher or lower fair values assigned to property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical performance or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant adverse change in the legality of our business ventures or the business climate in which we operate  and loss of a significant customer 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value using a two step impairment test 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow  using a discount rate equal to our weighted average cost of capital  or by a comparison to third party indications of fair market value 
the estimate of a reporting unit s fair value requires the use of assumptions and estimates regarding the reporting unit s future cash flows  growth rates and weighted average cost of capital 
any significant adverse changes in key assumptions about these businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge 
given the significance of goodwill  an adverse change to the estimated fair value could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements 
significant judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and products  it is possible that forecasts used to support our goodwill and trademark may change in the future which could result in significant non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations 
income taxes and deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years 
we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is unlikely 
we have established a valuation allowance for foreign loss carryforwards  as we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of these items will not be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance  against our deferred tax assets  our income tax expense will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
on january   we began accounting for income tax contingencies in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
prior to the adoption of fin  we accounted for income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no

on december   we had approximately million available for additional borrowing or letter of credit issuance under our revolver 
there were million of borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit under our revolver as of december  our ability to borrow under the credit facility will depend on our remaining in compliance with the limitations imposed by our lenders  including the maintenance of the specified financial covenants 
we were in compliance with our covenants as of december  and at the end of each of the first three quarters of fiscal year our contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness and future minimum operating lease obligations  as set forth in the table below cash payments due by period total within year within years within years after years long term debt  notes   long term debt  notes   long term debt  term loan c    long term debt  term loan d    long term debt  term loan e    long term debt  revolving credit facility   other long term debt  interest expense      purchase obligations   global draw earn out   operating leases      other long term liabilities    total contractual obligations    the convertible debentures are due in however  these convertible debentures could require cash payment before that date if holders of these convertible debentures elect to convert the convertible debentures  subject to certain conditions described below  if we call the convertible debentures for redemption  or upon certain corporate transactions 
based on rates in effect at december  we have a purchase order outstanding as of december  of approximately million for approximately  ticket checking machines for our new contract with the china sports lottery 
we have excluded approximately million of pension plan liabilities  deferred compensation liabilities of approximately million and the liability for uncertain income tax positions of million at december  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  we estimate that an earn out of approximately million may be paid to the selling shareholders and certain members of the management of global draw in the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum payable semi annually on each june and december  commencing june  the notes are senior subordinated  unsecured obligations of our company  ranking junior to all existing and future senior debt including obligations under the credit facility

the convertible debentures bear interest at the rate of per annum until june  and bear interest at the rate of per annum thereafter 
interest on the convertible debentures is payable semi annually on each june and december  commencing june  the convertible debentures are convertible into cash and shares of our class a common stock at a rate of shares per  principal amount of convertible debentures  which equates to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock  subject to adjustment as provided in the indenture governing the convertible debentures 
the convertible debentures contain a net settlement feature 
this feature entitles holders of each  principal amount of convertible debentures being converted to receive cash up to  and shares for any excess conversion value determined in a manner provided in the indenture governing the convertible debentures 
holders of the convertible debentures may convert the convertible debentures prior to stated maturity under the following circumstances during any calendar quarter before december   if the market price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter equals or exceeds of the conversion price  at any time on or after december  if the market price of our common stock on any date on or after december  equals or exceeds of the conversion price  if we call the convertible debentures for redemption  except for certain redemptions described in the indenture  or upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions described in the indenture

the indenture governing the convertible debentures limits our ability and the ability of our subsidiary guarantors to effect a consolidation or merger  or sell  convey  transfer  or lease substantially all of our or their assets 
we maintain a bond hedge in the form of call options designed to mitigate the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible debentures 
during the term of the bond hedge which expires no later than june   the sellers of the options will deliver to us upon our exercise of such options after a conversion of the convertible debentures a number of shares of common stock based on the extent to which the then market price of our class a common stock exceeds per share 
the options provide for net share settlement upon exercise 
during the fourth quarter ended december   approximately million in aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures were converted 
pursuant to the terms of the convertible debentures  we paid the principal amount of the convertible debentures that were converted in cash and the excess conversion value determined to be approximately  by delivering approximately  shares of our common stock 
in conjunction with the conversion  we acquired approximately  shares of our common stock by exercising a portion of the bond hedge and we delivered such shares to the holder of the convertible debentures that were converted 
the aggregate number of shares that we could be obligated to issue upon conversion of the remaining convertible debentures is  shares 
our pari mutuel wagering and online lottery systems service contracts require us to  among other things  maintain the central computing system and related hardware in efficient working order  provide added software functionality upon request  provide on site computer operators  and furnish necessary supplies 
our primary expenditures associated with these services are personnel and related costs  which are expensed as incurred and are included in operating expenses services in the consolidated statements of income 
historically  the revenues we derive from our pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems service contracts have exceeded the direct costs associated with fulfilling our obligations thereunder 
we expect that we will continue to realize positive cash flow and operating income as we extend or renew existing service contracts 
we also expect that we will enter into new contracts that are accretive to our cash flow 
in addition  through advancements in technology  we are continually deploying more efficient and cost effective methods for manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers 
we expect that technological efficiencies will continue to positively impact our future cash flows and operating results 
we are not party to any other material short term or long term obligations or commitments pursuant to these service contracts 
periodically  we bid on new pari mutuel and online lottery contracts 
once awarded  these contracts generally require significant up front capital expenditures for terminal assembly  customization of software  software and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration 
historically we have funded these up front costs through cash flows generated from operations  available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our ability to continue to procure new contracts will depend on  among other things  our then present liquidity levels and or our ability to borrow at commercially acceptable rates to finance the initial up front costs 
once operational  long term service contracts have been accretive to our operating cash flow 
the actual level of capital expenditures will ultimately largely depend on the extent to which we are successful in winning new contracts 
furthermore  our pari mutuel wagering network consists of approximately  wagering terminals 
periodically  we elect to upgrade the technological capabilities of older terminals and replace terminals that have exhausted their useful lives 
servicing our installed terminal base requires that we maintain a supply of parts and accessories on hand 
in the next year  we expect to purchase approximately  ticket checking machines for our new contract with the china sports lottery for a total cost of approximately million 
we are also required  contractually in some cases  to provide spare parts over an extended period of time  principally in connection with our systems and terminal sale transactions 
to meet our contractual obligations and maintain sufficient levels of on hand inventory to service our installed base  we purchase inventory on an as needed basis 
we presently have no inventory purchase obligations  other than in the ordinary course of business 
at december   our available cash  short term investments and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at december  we had approximately million available for additional borrowings or letter of credit issuance under our revolver at december  the amount of our available cash and short term investments fluctuates principally based on the timing of collections from our customers  cash expenditures associated with new and existing pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems contracts  borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities and changes in our working capital position 
the increase in our available cash from the december  level principally reflects the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  of million plus long term borrowings of million  offset by wagering and other capital expenditures and other investing activities totaling million  acquisition related payments of million and million of payments on long term debt 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities is derived from million of net cash provided by operations offset by million used in changes in working capital 
the working capital changes occurred principally from increases in accounts receivable  inventories and accrued liabilities and decreases in accounts payable  partially offset by a decrease in other current assets 
capital expenditures totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the corresponding period in wagering system expenditures  including software expenditures  totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in this increase is primarily due to the new lottery contracts in mexico and connecticut coupled with gaming terminals related to global draw 
cash flow from financing activities principally reflects the repayments of borrowings under the credit facility 
at december   our available cash  short term investments and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at december  effective with the january amendment to the credit facility  we had approximately million available for additional borrowings or letter of credit issuance under our revolver at december  the amount of our available cash and short term investments fluctuates principally based on the timing of collections from our customers  cash expenditures associated with new and existing pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems contracts  borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities and changes in our working capital position 
the decrease in our available cash from the december  level principally reflects the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  of million plus long term borrowings of million  offset by wagering and other capital expenditures and other investing activities totaling million  acquisition related payments of million and million of payments on long term debt 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities is derived from million of net cash provided by operations offset by million used in changes in working capital 
the working capital changes occurred principally from increases in accounts receivable  inventories  other current assets and decreases in accounts payable  offset by increases in accrued liabilities 
capital expenditures of million in the year ended december  are less than expenditures totaling million in the corresponding period in wagering system expenditures  including software expenditures  totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in this increase is primarily due to the new lottery contracts in shanghai  mexico  maryland and oklahoma  coupled with gaming terminals related to global draw 
cash flow from financing activities principally reflects the repayments of borrowings under the credit facility 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowing capacity under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs  including anticipated capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
while we are not aware of any particular trends  our contracts periodically renew and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in sustaining our cash flow from operations through renewal of our existing contracts or through the addition of new contracts 
in addition  lottery customers in the united states generally require service providers to provide performance bonds in connection with each state contract 
our ability to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms is subject to prevailing market conditions  which may be impacted by economic and political events 
although we have not experienced any difficulty obtaining such bonds  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
while we are not aware of any reason to do so  if we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness  on or before maturity  or provide letters of credit or cash in lieu of performance bonds  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
further  the terms of the indenture governing the convertible debentures give holders the right to convert the convertible debentures under certain circumstances as described above 
the convertible debentures contain a net settlement feature 
this feature entitles holders of each  principal amount of convertible debentures being converted to receive cash up to  and shares for any excess conversion value determined in a manner provided in the indenture governing the convertible debentures 
we cannot offer any assurance that we will have sufficient available cash to pay for the convertible debentures presented to us for conversion nor can we offer any assurance that we will be able to refinance all or a portion of the converted convertible debentures at that time 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r supersedes sfas no 
and requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at the fair value as of that date 
this includes the measurement of the acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination  the recognition of contingent consideration  the accounting for pre acquisition gain and loss contingencies  the recognition of capitalized in process research and development  the accounting for acquisition related restructuring cost accruals  the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs and the recognition of changes in the acquirer s income tax valuation allowance and deferred taxes 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december  and is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is applied 
accordingly  any business combinations we engage in on or after january  will be recorded and disclosed according to sfas r 
we expect sfas r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards that require noncontrolling interests to be reported as a component of equity  changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest be accounted for as equity transactions  and any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary be initially measured at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december  and is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is applied 
we are required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value fair value option 
the fair value option may be elected on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable  unless a new election date occurs 
if the fair value option is elected for an instrument  sfas specifies that unrealized gains and losses for that instrument be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas was effective for us on january  we did not apply the fair value option to any of our outstanding instruments and  therefore  sfas did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas was effective for us on january  for all financial assets and liabilities and for nonfinancial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
for all other nonfinancial assets and liabilities  sfas is effective for us on january  as it relates to our non pension related financial assets and liabilities and for nonfinancial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are still in the process of evaluating the impact that sfas will have on our pension related financial liabilities and our nonfinancial assets and liabilities not valued on a recurring basis at least annually 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our products and services are sold to a diverse group of customers throughout the world 
as such  we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as a result of changes in general economic conditions  sources of supply  competition  foreign exchange rates  tax reform  litigation and regulatory developments 
see item a risk factors for a more complete description of these risks and uncertainties 
the diversity and breadth of our products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes from any single event would materially affect our financial position 
additionally  as a result of the diversity of our customer base  we do not consider ourselves exposed to concentration of credit risks 
these risks are further minimized by setting credit limits  ongoing monitoring of customer account balances  and assessment of the customers financial strengths 
inflation has not had an abnormal or unanticipated effect on our operations 
inflationary pressures would be significant to our business if raw materials used for instant lottery ticket production  prepaid phone card production or terminal manufacturing are significantly affected 
available supply from the paper and electronics industries tends to fluctuate and prices may be affected by supply 
for fiscal  inflation was not a significant factor in our results of operations  and we were not impacted by significant pricing changes in our costs  except for personnel related expenditures 
we are unable to forecast the prices or supply of substrate  component parts or other raw materials in  but we currently do not anticipate any substantial changes that will materially affect our operating results 
in certain limited cases  our lottery contracts with our customers contain provisions to adjust for inflation on an annual basis  but we cannot be assured that this adjustment would cover raw material price increases or other costs of services 
while we have long term and generally satisfactory relationships with most of our suppliers  we also believe alternative sources to meet our raw material and production needs are available 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and equity market risks as we seek debt and equity capital to sustain our operations 
at december   approximately of our debt was in fixed rate instruments 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity  capital resources and working capital for additional information about our financial instruments 
principal amount by expected maturity average interest rate december  dollars in thousands twelve months ended december thereafter total fmv debt at fixed interest rates  weighted average interest rates debt at variable interest rates   weighted average interest rates we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in the united kingdom  germany  the netherlands  spain  sweden  mexico  austria  australia  chile and ireland 
our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term investments 
accordingly  we do not hedge these net investments 
our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the euro and the sterling in relation to the united states dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures  which can adversely affect our results of operations 
we manage our foreign currency exchange risks on a global basis by one or more of the following i securing payment from our customers in us dollars  when possible  ii entering into foreign currency exchange contracts and iii netting asset and liability exposures denominated in similar foreign currencies  to the extent possible 
in addition  a significant portion of the cost attributable to our foreign operations is incurred in the local currencies 
we may  from time to time  enter into foreign currency exchange or other contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain firm sales commitments  anticipated revenue streams and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
we believe that a hypothetical upward or downward fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would not have a material impact on future earnings  fair values  or cash flows 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments are in high quality securities placed with a wide array of institutions with high credit ratings 
the investment policy limits our exposure to concentration of credit risks 
we believe that the impact of a increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our investment income and interest expense from bank loans
