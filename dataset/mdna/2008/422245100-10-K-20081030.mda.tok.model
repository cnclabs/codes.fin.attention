we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies we describe our accounting policies in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in understanding the estimates and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition we generally determine our contract fees by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per member per month pmpm by the number of members covered by our services during the month 
we typically set the pmpm rates during contract negotiations with customers based on the value we expect our programs to create and a sharing of that value between the customer and the company 
in addition  some of our services are billed on a fee for service basis 
our contracts with health plans generally range from three to five years with provisions for subsequent renewal  contracts with self insured employers  either directly or through their health plans  typically have one to three year terms 
some contracts allow the customer to terminate early 
some of our contracts provide that a portion up to of our fees may be refundable to the customer performance based if our programs do not achieve  when compared to a baseline year  a targeted percentage reduction in the customer s healthcare costs and selected clinical and or other criteria that focus on improving the health of the members 
approximately of revenues recorded during fiscal were performance based and were subject to final reconciliation as of august  we anticipate that this percentage will fluctuate due to the level of performance based fees in new contracts  revenue recognition associated with performance based fees  and the timing of data reconciliation  which varies according to contract terms 
a limited number of contracts also provide opportunities for us to receive incentive bonuses in excess of the contractual pmpm rate if we exceed contractual performance targets 
we generally bill our customers each month for the entire amount of the fees contractually due for the prior month s enrollment  which typically includes the amount  if any  that is performance based and may be subject to refund should we not meet performance targets 
deferred revenues arise from contracts which permit upfront billing and collection of fees covering the entire contractual service period  generally months 
contractually  we cannot bill for any incentive bonus until after contract settlement 
fees for service are typically billed in the month after the services are provided 
we recognize revenue as follows we recognize the fixed portion of pmpm fees and fees for service as revenue during the period we perform our services  we recognize the performance based portion of the monthly fees based on the most recent assessment of our performance  which represents the amount that the customer would legally be obligated to pay if the contract were terminated as of the latest balance sheet date  and we recognize additional incentive bonuses based on the most recent assessment of our performance  to the extent we consider such amounts collectible 
we assess our level of performance for our contracts based on medical claims and other data that the customer is contractually required to supply 
a minimum of four to six months data is typically required for us to measure performance 
in assessing our performance  we may include estimates such as medical claims incurred but not reported and a medical cost trend compared to a baseline year 
in addition  we may also provide contractual reserves  when appropriate  for billing adjustments at contract reconciliation 
substantially all of the fees under the medicare health support pilots in which we participated were performance based 
our original cooperative agreements required that  by the end of the third year  we achieve a cumulative net savings total savings for the intervention population as compared to the control group less fees received from cms of 
under an amendment to our agreement for our stand alone medicare health support pilot in maryland and the district of columbia  we began serving a refresh population of approximately  beneficiaries on august   which was measured as a separate cohort for two years  by the end of which the program was required to achieve a cumulative net savings when compared to a new control cohort 
in april  we signed an amendment to our medicare health support protocol with cms  which changed the financial performance target for both the initial cohort and the refresh population to budget neutrality 
although we receive the medical claims and other data associated with the intervention group under these pilots on a monthly basis  we assess our performance against the control group under these pilots based on quarterly summary performance reports received from cms independent financial reconciliation contractor 
as of august   we had recognized million of performance based fees under the medicare health support pilots  and contract billings in excess of earned revenue totaled million 
under the terms of our cooperative agreement with cms  we expect to receive the final quarterly summary performance report from cms independent financial reconciliation contractor in the first half of calendar while the cooperative agreement allows for a day reconciliation period upon receipt of the final quarterly summary performance report  we cannot assure you that we will be able to reach a final settlement within this timeframe 
if data is insufficient or incomplete to measure performance  or interim performance measures indicate that we are not meeting performance targets  we do not recognize performance based fees subject to refund as revenues but instead record them in a current liability account entitled contract billings in excess of earned revenue 
only in the event we do not meet performance levels by the end of the measurement period  typically one year  are we contractually obligated to refund some or all of the performance based fees 
we would only reverse revenues that we had already recognized if performance to date in the measurement period  previously above targeted levels  subsequently dropped below targeted levels 
historically  any such adjustments have been immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations 
during the settlement process under a contract  which generally occurs six to eight months after the end of a contract year  we settle any performance based fees and reconcile healthcare claims and clinical data 
as of august   performance based fees that have not yet been settled with our customers but that have been recognized as revenue in the current and prior years totaled approximately million 
of this amount  million was based on calculations which include estimates such as medical claims incurred but not reported and or the customer s medical cost trend compared to a baseline year  while million was based entirely on actual data received from our customers 
data reconciliation differences  for which we provide contractual allowances until we reach agreement with respect to identified issues  can arise between the customer and us due to customer data deficiencies  omissions  and or data discrepancies 
performance related adjustments including any amounts recorded as revenue that were ultimately refunded  changes in estimates  data reconciliation differences  or adjustments to incentive bonuses may cause us to recognize or reverse revenue in a current fiscal year that pertains to services provided during a prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  we recognized a net increase in revenue of million that related to services provided prior to fiscal impairment of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired based upon an impairment review  we calculate any impairment using a fair value based goodwill impairment test as required by sfas no 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between two willing parties 
we estimate fair value using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
we amortize other identifiable intangible assets  such as acquired technologies and customer contracts  on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  except for certain trade names  which have an indefinite life and are not subject to amortization 
we review intangible assets not subject to amortization on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we assess the potential impairment of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable  we calculate any impairment using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
sfas no 
requires significant judgment in determining income tax provisions  including determination of deferred tax assets  deferred tax liabilities  and any valuation allowances that might be required against deferred tax assets  and in evaluating tax positions 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

under fin no 
 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values at the date of grant 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and expected stock option exercise behavior 
in addition  we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
business strategy our primary strategy is to optimize the health of entire populations  as well as the quality and affordability of healthcare  through our health and care support solutions both domestically and internationally  thereby creating value for individuals  health plans  governments  and employers 
we plan to continue using our scalable state of the art call centers  medical information content  behavior change processes and techniques  strategic relationships  health provider networks and proprietary technologies to gain a competitive advantage in delivering our health and care support services 
we continue to see increasing demand for integrated health and care support solutions from self insured employers 
as a result  we expect to continue adding and enhancing solutions to extend our reach and effectiveness for entire populations 
the flexibility of our programs allows customers to enter the health and care support market at the level of services that they deem appropriate for their organization 
customers may select from a single health or care support program to a total population approach  in which all members of the customer s population are eligible to receive the benefit of our programs 
we deliver programs that engage consumers in their health 
we believe that we can achieve health improvements and generate significant cost savings and productivity improvements by addressing consumer and customer needs for effective programs that support the individual throughout his or her lifetime 
we anticipate that we will continue to enhance  expand and further integrate our health and care support capabilities  pursue opportunities in domestic government and international markets  and enhance our information technology support 
we may add some of these new capabilities and technologies through internal development  strategic alliances with other entities and or through selective acquisitions or investments 
results of operations the following table shows the components of the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended august    and expressed as a percentage of revenues 
year ended august  revenues cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization included below selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income figures may not add due to rounding 
revenues revenues for fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal primarily due to the acquisition of axia on december  the remainder of the increase is primarily due to the following million due to the addition of new customers  new programs with existing customers  or the expansion of existing programs into additional populations with existing customers since the beginning of fiscal  and million due to increased membership in customers existing programs 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenues of million related to contract terminations and restructurings with certain customers 
revenues for fiscal increased over fiscal primarily due to the following revenues of million attributable to the acquisition of axia on december   an increase in the number of self insured employer billed lives for care support programs on behalf of our health plan customers from  at august  to  at august   the addition of new care support programs or expansion of existing programs into additional populations with eight existing customers since the beginning of fiscal  and the commencement of ten new care support contracts since the beginning of fiscal these increases were slightly offset by decreases in fiscal revenues compared to fiscal due to the following contract terminations with certain customers  the largest of which we began providing services to again on october   and decreased revenues associated with the medicare health support pilots 
due primarily to an increasing cumulative net savings target over the term of the pilots  during fiscal cumulative savings fell below the cumulative net savings target  resulting in a reversal of million in performance based revenues 
we anticipate that revenues for fiscal will not increase significantly  and could decrease  over fiscal revenues primarily due to contract restructurings and terminations with certain customers that may more than offset revenue increases from new or existing customers 
cost of services cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues for fiscal increased to compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the following an increased portion of our revenue growth generated by fitness center programs  which typically have a higher cost of services as a percentage of revenue than our other programs  and an increase in the level of employee bonus provision during fiscal compared to fiscal based on the company s financial performance against established internal targets during these periods 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenues due to decreased costs during fiscal related to the two medicare health support pilots in which we participated  which ended in january and july  respectively 
cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues for the three months ended august  was compared to an average of for the first three quarters of fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefits during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to capacity consolidation in may through august cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the following a decrease in the level of employee bonus provision due to the company s financial performance not meeting its established internal targets  and a decrease in professional consulting fees related to information technology initiatives 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in cost of services as a percentage of revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal related to the following increased costs related to the medicare health support pilots  primarily due to additional costs related to the timing of the pilot in georgia in collaboration with cigna  which we began serving during the first quarter of fiscal  enhanced interventions to focus on the special needs of this population  and additional costs related to the refresh population  which we began serving on august   the acquisition of axia  which has somewhat higher cost of services as a percentage of revenues due to the nature of health support services  as well as the related integration costs  and an increase in salary and benefit expense  primarily related to organizational design changes in our field support and operations structure 
while we believe cost of services as a percentage of revenues will remain generally consistent in the long term with historical percentages  we anticipate that cost of services as a percentage of revenues will increase during the four month transition period primarily due to costs associated with the aforementioned streamlining of our management structure and other related restructuring initiatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the following efficiencies from the integration of the axia acquisition  and our ability to more effectively leverage our selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of growth in our operations 
these decreases were somewhat offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal related to relocating to and operating our new corporate headquarters during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the following an increase in salaries and benefits related to changes in our infrastructure to support anticipated future growth  an increase in professional consulting fees related to certain strategic initiatives  and integration costs related to the acquisition of axia 
these increases were somewhat offset by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal related to the following a decrease in the level of employee bonus provision due to the company not meeting its internal incentive targets  and the acquisition of axia  which had somewhat lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues due to the nature of health support services 
while we believe selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain generally consistent in the long term with historical percentages  we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues will increase during the four month transition period primarily due to costs associated with the aforementioned streamlining of our management structure and other related restructuring initiatives 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following increased depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures on computer software development  which we made to enhance our information technology capabilities  depreciation and amortization expense associated with the depreciable assets and identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with the axia acquisition on december   and increased amortization expense associated with patents which were acquired in august depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal increased compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following depreciation and amortization expense associated with the depreciable assets and preliminary identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with the axia acquisition on december   and increased depreciation expense associated with capital expenditures to enhance our information technology capabilities  to relocate our phoenix call center  and expand our calling capacity at existing call centers 
we anticipate that depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal will increase over fiscal primarily as a result of additional capital expenditures made during fiscal associated with our new corporate headquarters  the opening of four new call centers  and growth and improvement in our information technology capabilities 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal increased million compared to fiscal  primarily related to increased interest expense during the three months ended november  compared to the three months ended november  due to borrowings under the third amended credit agreement related to the acquisition of axia on december  this increase was somewhat offset by a decrease in interest expense from lower average interest rates during fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense for fiscal increased million compared to fiscal  primarily due to borrowings under the third amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement the third amended credit agreement related to the acquisition of axia on december  as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below  a significant portion of our long term debt is subject to fixed interest rate swap agreements  however  due to current economic conditions that have created uncertainty and credit constraints in the markets  we cannot predict the impact that potential changes in interest rates will have on our variable rate debt 
income tax expense our effective tax rate increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the impact of interest accruals related to unrecognized tax benefits included in our income tax provision for fiscal the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate of and our effective tax rate are due primarily to the impact of state income taxes  the lack of tax benefit on certain expenses incurred in international initiatives  the tax interest accruals described above  and certain non deductible expenses for income tax purposes 
our effective tax rate increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the lack of tax benefit on certain expenses incurred in international initiatives  somewhat offset by a reduction in our average state income tax rate  which is impacted by our geographic mix of earnings 
the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate of and our effective tax rate are due primarily to the impact of state income taxes  the lack of tax benefit on certain expenses incurred in international initiatives  and certain non deductible expenses for income tax purposes 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal will not change significantly from fiscal  however  we continue to evaluate the impact on our effective tax rate of both international operations and any future adjustments related to uncertain tax positions 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased million during fiscal to million at august  from million at august  operating activities for fiscal generated cash of million compared to million for fiscal the decrease in operating cash flow resulted primarily from the following an increase in days sales outstanding in accounts receivable to days at august  from days at august  primarily due to timing of cash receipts from several large customers  and a decrease in cash collections recorded to contract billings in excess of earned revenue  primarily related to the medicare health support pilots 
these decreases were somewhat offset by increases in operating cash flow primarily related to the following a lower employee bonus payment during fiscal compared to fiscal an increase in interest payments during fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a full year of borrowings under the third amended credit agreement related to the acquisition of axia on december   and lease incentives received during fiscal  primarily related to our new corporate headquarters 
investing activities during fiscal used million in cash and consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
financing activities during fiscal used million in cash primarily from repurchases of our common stock and repayments on borrowings under the third amended credit agreement 
these uses were somewhat offset by additional borrowings under the third amended credit agreement 
on december   we entered into the third amended credit agreement 
the third amended credit agreement provides us with a million revolving credit facility  including a swingline sub facility of million and a million sub facility for letters of credit  a million term loan facility  and an uncommitted incremental accordion facility of million 
as of august   availability under our revolving credit facility totaled million 
revolving advances under the third amended credit agreement generally bear interest  at our option  at libor plus a spread of to or the greater of the federal funds rate plus  or the prime rate  plus a spread of to 
term loan borrowings bear interest  at our option  at libor plus or the greater of the federal funds rate plus  or the prime rate 
the third amended credit agreement also provides for a fee ranging between and of unused commitments 
the third amended credit agreement is secured by guarantees from most of the company s domestic subsidiaries and by security interests in substantially all of the company s and such subsidiaries assets 
we are required to repay outstanding revolving loans on the revolving commitment termination date  which is december  we are required to repay term loans in quarterly principal installments aggregating million each  which commenced on march   and the entire unpaid principal balance of the term loans is due and payable at maturity on december  the third amended credit agreement contains various financial covenants  which require us to maintain  as defined  ratios or levels of total funded debt to ebitda  fixed charge coverage  and net worth 
the third amended credit agreement also restricts the payment of dividends and limits the amount of repurchases of the company s common stock 
as of august   we were in compliance with all of the covenant requirements of the third amended credit agreement 
as of august   we are currently a party to the following interest rate swap agreements for which we receive a variable rate of interest based on the three month libor and for which we pay the following fixed rates of interest plus a spread of to on revolving advances and a spread of on term loan borrowings swap notional amount in s fixed interest rate termination date march  december  december  december  december  march  the principal value of this swap arrangement amortizes over a month period 
the notional value of this swap as of august  was million 
this swap agreement becomes effective april  this swap agreement becomes effective october  this swap agreement becomes effective january  we currently believe that we meet the hedge accounting criteria under sfas no 
in accounting for these interest rate swap agreements 
we believe that cash flows from operating activities  our available cash  and our expected available credit under the third amended credit agreement will continue to enable us to meet our contractual obligations and to fund our current operations for the foreseeable future 
however  if our operations require significant additional financing resources  such as capital expenditures for technology improvements  additional call centers and or letters of credit or other forms of financial assurance to guarantee our performance under the terms of new contracts  or if we are required to refund performance based fees pursuant to contract terms  we may need to raise additional capital by expanding our existing credit facility and or issuing debt or equity 
if we face a limited ability to arrange such financing  it may restrict our ability to effectively operate our business 
current economic conditions  including turmoil and uncertainty in the financial services industry  have created constraints on liquidity and the ability to obtain credit in the markets 
should the credit markets not improve  we cannot assure you that we would be able to secure additional financing if needed and  if such funds were available  whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us 
if contract development accelerates or acquisition opportunities arise  we may need to issue additional debt or equity to provide the funding for these increased growth opportunities 
we may also issue equity in connection with future acquisitions or strategic alliances 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to issue additional debt or equity on terms that would be acceptable to us 
in july  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program which allowed for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions through july  as of august   we had repurchased the full million of our common stock authorized under the share repurchase program 
contractual obligations the following schedule summarizes our contractual cash obligations by the indicated period as of august  payments due by year ended august  in s and after total capital lease obligations deferred compensation plan payments long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities other contractual cash obligations total contractual cash obligations includes scheduled principal payments  repayment of outstanding revolving loans  and estimated interest payments on outstanding borrowings under the third amended credit agreement 
we have excluded long term liabilities and interest payable of million and million  respectively  related to fin no 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of these payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions 
other contractual cash obligations primarily represent a perpetual license agreement and year strategic relationship agreement that we entered into during the second quarter of fiscal we have total contractual cash obligations of million related to these agreements  million of which will occur ratably during the first five years of the agreements  and the remaining million of which will occur ratably over the last years of the agreements 
the table also includes cash payments in connection with our strategic alliance agreements  excluding certain variable costs related to one strategic alliance that are based on the number of future eligible members 
recently issued accounting standards fair value measurement in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities  including a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop fair value assumptions 
it also requires expanded disclosure about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings
