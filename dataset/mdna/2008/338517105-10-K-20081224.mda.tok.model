new limited partnership restaurants the limited partnership owned restaurant located in pembroke pines  florida opened for business during the first quarter of our fiscal year october  and the limited partnership owned restaurant located in davie  florida opened for business during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year july  
as new restaurants open  our income from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to fund pre opening costs  including but not limited to pre opening rent for the new locations

management believes that the company s current cash availability from its line of credit and expected cash from operations will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
trends during the next twelve months  we expect continued increases in aggregate restaurant sales as compared to prior periods due primarily to the restaurant in davie  florida being open for the entire twelve month period 
we expect same store restaurant food and bar sales to decline over the next twelve month period due primarily to the current domestic and global financial crisis 
we expect package liquor store sales to decrease due primarily to increased competition 
we expect higher food costs and higher overall expenses  which will adversely affect our net income 
in december   we raised menu prices to offset the higher food costs and overall expenses

we have increased our advertising to attract customers 
as a last resort  we will raise menu prices whenever necessary and wherever competitively possible

purchase commitments in order to fix the cost and ensure adequate supply of baby back ribs for our restaurants  on november   we entered into a purchase agreement with our rib supplier  whereby we agreed to purchase approximately  of baby back ribs during calendar year from this vendor at a fixed cost

in thousands current assets   current liabilities   working capital   working capital as of september  increased by  or from working capital as of september  our working capital improved during our fiscal year due to minimal demand upon our cash flow for extraordinary items during the fiscal year 
during our fiscal year  the limited partnership which owns the pembroke pines  florida restaurant completed its private offering and reimbursed us  for advances we made to the limited partnership for pre opening expenses

off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of the end of our fiscal year or our fiscal year critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements estimated useful lives of property and equipment the estimate of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates 
expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material 
in addition  periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material 
we estimate the useful life of those assets by considering  among other things  expected use  life of the lease on the building  and warranty period  if applicable 
the assets are then depreciated using a straight line method over those estimated lives 
these estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary 
any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary 
consolidation of limited partnerships as of september   we operate nine restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants 
additionally  we expect that any expansion which takes place in opening new restaurants will also result in us operating the restaurants as general partner 
in addition to the general partnership interest we also purchase limited partnership units ranging from to of the total units outstanding 
as a result of these controlling interests  we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own in excess of of the equity interests 
all intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
the minority interests in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share 
income taxes financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes requires  among other things  recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss and tip credit carryforwards to the extent that realization of said benefits is more likely than not 
for discussion regarding our carryforwards refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year on september   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standard board fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
we previously had accounted for tax contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for contingencies 
as required by fin  which clarifies fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
at the adoption date  we applied fin to tax positions for all open tax years 
we had no material unrecognized tax benefits and no adjustments to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows were required 
we do not expect that unrecognized tax benefits will increase within the next twelve months 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense 
during the first quarter of our fiscal year  the corporate income tax returns for our fiscal years ending september  and september  were audited by the internal revenue service 
as a result of the audit  we paid additional corporate income tax of  and  for our fiscal years ending september  and september   respectively 
the effects of the internal revenue service adjustments were considered in the computation of our income tax provision for our fiscal year ended september  other matters impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  beverage and labor costs 
a large number of restaurant personnel are paid at rates based upon applicable minimum wage and increases in minimum wage directly affect labor costs 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results  but this circumstance may change in the future if food and fuel costs continue to rise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not ordinarily hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
as of september  and september   we held no equity securities 
interest rate risk at september   borrowings under our line of credit bear interest at a variable annual rate equal to the prime rate of interest 
subsequent to the end of our fiscal year  we changed our primary banking relationship to another unaffiliated financial institution  which includes a new line of credit 
the outstanding balance on our line of credit bears interest at bba libor month rate  plus 
increases in interest rates may have a material affect upon results of operations  depending upon the outstanding principal balance on our line of credit from time to time 
at september   our cash resources earn interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our return on these funds is affected by fluctuations in interest rates there is no assurance that interest rates will increase or decrease over our next fiscal year or that an increase will not have a material adverse effect on our operations
