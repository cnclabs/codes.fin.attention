table of contents critical accounting estimates and judgments the consolidated financial statements include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management for transactions that are not yet complete 
such estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts in the financial statements 
those estimates and judgments that were most critical to the preparation of the financial statements involved the determination of loss reserves and the recoverability of related reinsurance recoverables 
these estimates and judgments  which are discussed within the following analysis of our results of operations  require the use of assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and therefore are subject to change as facts and circumstances develop 
if different estimates and judgments had been applied  materially different amounts might have been reported in the financial statements 
overview the following highlights do not address all of the matters covered in the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or contain all of the information that may be important to chubb s shareholders or the investing public 
this overview should be read in conjunction with the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net income was billion in compared with billion in and billion in net income in and benefited from substantially higher underwriting income in our property and casualty insurance business compared with underwriting results were significantly more profitable in and compared with our combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined ratio in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in the greater catastrophe impact in was due to costs of million related to hurricane katrina  including estimated net losses of million and net reinsurance reinstatement premium costs of million 
total net premiums written decreased by in and in net premiums written in our insurance business increased in and in the low growth in our insurance business in both years reflected our continued emphasis on underwriting discipline in an increasingly competitive market environment 
in the reinsurance assumed business  net premiums written decreased in and in  reflecting our sale of the ongoing business to harbor point limited in december during  we experienced overall favorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end  due primarily to favorable loss trends in recent years in the professional liability classes  lower than expected emergence of losses in the homeowners and commercial property classes and better than expected reported loss activity in the run off of our reinsurance assumed business 
during  we experienced overall favorable development of million due primarily to lower than expected emergence of losses in the homeowners and commercial property classes 
during  we experienced overall unfavorable development of million due to adverse development in the professional liability and commercial liability classes offset in part by favorable development in the homeowners and commercial property classes 
property and casualty investment income after tax increased by in and in the growth was due to an increase in invested assets over the period

table of contents a summary of our consolidated net income is as follows years ended december in millions property and casualty insurance corporate and other realized investment gains consolidated income before income tax federal and foreign income tax consolidated net income property and casualty insurance a summary of the results of operations of our property and casualty insurance business is as follows years ended december in millions underwriting net premiums written decrease increase in unearned premiums premiums earned losses and loss expenses operating costs and expenses increase in deferred policy acquisition costs dividends to policyholders underwriting income investments investment income before expenses investment expenses investment income other income charges property and casualty income before tax property and casualty investment income after tax property and casualty income before tax in was higher than in which  in turn  was substantially higher than in income in each year  but more so in and  benefited from highly profitable underwriting results 
underwriting income in was higher than in  particularly in our specialty insurance business unit 
underwriting income in was substantially higher than in  due largely to significantly lower catastrophe losses  particularly in our commercial insurance business unit  as well as improvement in our specialty insurance business unit 
results in and also benefited from significant increases in investment income due to an increase in invested assets in both years 

table of contents the profitability of our property and casualty insurance business depends on the results of both our underwriting and investment operations 
we view these as two distinct operations since the underwriting functions are managed separately from the investment function 
accordingly  in assessing our performance  we evaluate underwriting results separately from investment results 
underwriting operations underwriting results we evaluate the underwriting results of our property and casualty insurance business in the aggregate and also for each of our separate business units 
net premiums written net premiums written amounted to billion in  a decrease of compared with net premiums written in decreased compared with in both years  a slight increase in premiums from our insurance business was more than offset by a substantial decline in premiums from our reinsurance assumed business 
net premiums written by business unit were as follows years ended december increase increase decrease decrease vs 
vs 
dollars in millions personal insurance commercial insurance specialty insurance total insurance reinsurance assumed total net premiums written from our insurance business grew in and in premiums in were reduced by reinsurance reinstatement premium costs of million related to hurricane katrina 
premiums in benefited from a million reduction of previously accrued reinsurance reinstatement premium costs 
premiums in the united states  which represent about of our insurance premiums  decreased in and increased in insurance premiums outside the us grew in and in in both years  such growth was when measured in local currencies 
the slight overall growth in net written premiums in our insurance business in both and reflected our continued emphasis on underwriting discipline in an increasingly competitive market environment 
rates were under competitive pressure that varied by class of business and geographic area 
in both years  we retained a high percentage of our existing customers and renewed these accounts at prices we believe to be appropriate relative to the exposure 
in addition  while we continued to be selective  we found opportunities to write new business at acceptable rates  however  we saw fewer such opportunities as progressed 
we expect the competitive market environment to continue in we expect that overall premiums in our insurance business will be flat to modestly down in compared with  with a modest increase for personal insurance and modest decreases for both commercial insurance and specialty insurance 
net reinsurance assumed premiums written decreased by in and in premiums in included net reinstatement premium revenue of million related to hurricane katrina 
the significant premium decline reflects the sale of our ongoing reinsurance assumed business to harbor point limited in december  which is discussed below 

table of contents reinsurance ceded our premiums written are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers who assume a portion of the risk under the insurance policies we write that are subject to the reinsurance 
as a result of the substantial losses incurred by reinsurers from the catastrophes in and  the cost of property catastrophe reinsurance increased significantly in and there were capacity restrictions in the marketplace 
although property catastrophe reinsurance rates increased in  our overall ceded reinsurance premiums for our insurance business  excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums related to hurricane katrina  were only modestly higher than in due to modifications to certain of our reinsurance treaties 
on our casualty clash treaty  our initial retention remained at million 
we reduced our reinsurance coverage at the top of the program by million and increased our participation in the program 
on our commercial property per risk treaty  we increased our retention from million to million 
our property catastrophe treaty for events in the united states was modified to increase our initial retention from million to million and to increase our participation in the program 
at the same time  we increased the insurance coverage in the northeastern part of the country by million 
our property catastrophe treaty for events outside the united states was modified to increase our initial retention from million to million 
reinsurance rates generally remained steady in  due in part to a relatively low level of catastrophes in however  capacity restrictions continued in some segments of the marketplace 
our overall reinsurance costs in were similar to those in we did not renew our casualty clash treaty in as we believed the cost was not justified given the limited capacity and terms available 
the treaty had provided coverage of approximately of losses between million and million per insured event 
on our commercial property per risk treaty  we increased the reinsurance coverage at the top of the program by million 
this treaty now provides approximately million of coverage per risk in excess of our million retention 
the structure of our property catastrophe program for events in the united states was modified in but the overall coverage is similar to the previous program 
the principal catastrophe treaty provides coverage of approximately of losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between million and billion  with additional coverage of of losses between billion and billion in the northeastern part of the country  where we have our greatest concentration of catastrophe exposure 
we also purchased in april fully collateralized four year reinsurance coverage for homeowners related losses sustained from qualifying hurricane loss events in the northeastern part of the united states 
this reinsurance was purchased from east lane re ltd  a cayman islands reinsurance company  which financed the provision of reinsurance through the issuance of million in catastrophe bonds to investors under two separate bond tranches 
this reinsurance provides coverage of approximately of covered losses between billion and billion 
we purchased additional reinsurance from the florida hurricane catastrophe fund  which is a state mandated fund designed to reimburse insurers for a portion of their residential catastrophic hurricane losses 
our participation in the fund limits our initial retention in florida for homeowners related losses to approximately million 
our property catastrophe treaty for events outside the united states was renewed in with no modification of its terms 
the treaty provides coverage of approximately of losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between million and million 

table of contents our property reinsurance treaties generally contain limitations on the losses that we can recover relating to acts of terrorism  depending on the geographic location where the act is committed and the class of business affected 
we do not expect the changes we made to our reinsurance program during and to have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
most of our ceded reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss and catastrophe contracts that protect against a specified part or all of certain types of losses over stipulated amounts arising from any one occurrence or event 
therefore  unless we incur losses that exceed our initial retention under these contracts  we do not receive any loss recoveries 
as a result  in certain years  we cede premiums to other insurance companies and receive few  if any  loss recoveries 
however  in a year in which there is a significant catastrophic event such as hurricane katrina or a series of large individual losses  we may receive substantial loss recoveries 
the impact of ceded reinsurance on net premiums written and earned and on net losses and loss expenses incurred for the three years ended december  is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our property reinsurance treaties expire on april  while we expect that reinsurance rates for property risks will decline somewhat in  the final structure of our program and amount of coverage purchased will be determinants of our ceded reinsurance premium cost in we expect that the availability of reinsurance for certain coverages  such as terrorism  will continue to be very limited in profitability the combined loss and expense ratio  expressed as a percentage  is the key measure of underwriting profitability traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance business 
management evaluates the performance of our underwriting operations and of each of our business units using  among other measures  the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
it is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned loss ratio plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written expense ratio after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders 
when the combined ratio is under  underwriting results are generally considered profitable  when the combined ratio is over  underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable 
statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
under statutory accounting principles  policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately  not at the time premiums are earned 
management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with gaap  among other measures  to assess the overall performance of our underwriting operations 
to convert statutory underwriting results to a gaap basis  policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
underwriting income determined in accordance with gaap is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and gaap underwriting expenses incurred 
underwriting results were significantly more profitable in and compared with the combined loss and expense ratio for our overall property and casualty business was as follows years ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined loss and expense ratio 
table of contents the loss ratio improved in and again in  reflecting the favorable loss experience which we believe resulted from our disciplined underwriting in recent years as well as relatively mild loss trends in certain classes of business 
the loss ratio in was adversely affected by higher catastrophe losses  primarily from hurricane katrina 
in  net catastrophe losses incurred were million  which represented percentage points of the loss ratio 
net catastrophe losses incurred in were million  which were offset in part by a million reduction in previously accrued reinsurance reinstatement premium costs related to hurricane katrina 
the net impact of catastrophes in accounted for percentage points of the loss ratio 
in  we incurred million of net catastrophe losses and million in related net reinsurance reinstatement premium costs  which in the aggregate accounted for percentage points of the loss ratio 
the reinsurance reinstatement premium costs and a substantial portion of the catastrophe losses in related to hurricane katrina 
at the end of  we estimated that our net losses from hurricane katrina were million and our net reinsurance reinstatement premium costs related to the hurricane were million 
in our insurance business  estimated net losses were million and reinstatement premium costs were million  for an aggregate cost of million 
in our reinsurance assumed business  estimated net losses were million and net reinstatement premium revenue was million  for a net cost of million 
we estimated that our gross losses from hurricane katrina were about billion 
almost all of the losses were from property exposure and business interruption claims 
our net losses of million were significantly lower than the gross amount due to a property per risk treaty that limited our net loss per risk and our property catastrophe treaty 
during  a large percentage of our claims from hurricane katrina were settled 
as a result  there were many adjustments  both favorable and unfavorable  to our loss estimates for individual claims related to this event 
these adjustments produced a reduction in our estimates for gross losses and reinsurance recoverable of million and million  respectively  as well as a million reduction of previously accrued reinsurance reinstatement premium costs 
other than the reinsurance recoverable related to hurricane katrina  we did not have any recoveries from our catastrophe reinsurance treaties during the three year period ended december  because there were no other individual catastrophes for which our losses exceeded our initial retention under the treaties 
our expense ratio increased in both and the increase in was due primarily to higher commissions  largely the result of premium growth outside the united states in certain classes of business for which commission rates are high 
the increase in was due to a decrease in net premiums written whereas compensation and other operating costs increased 
in lieu of paying contingent commissions  beginning in  we implemented a new guaranteed supplemental compensation program for agents and brokers in the united states with whom we previously had contingent commission agreements 
under this arrangement  agents and brokers are paid a percentage of written premiums on eligible lines of business in a calendar year based upon their prior performance 
the total guaranteed supplemental compensation payout for will be substantially the same as the contingent commission payout for however  the change in our commission arrangements created a difference in the timing of expense recognition  which resulted in a one time benefit to income during the transition year 
the impact of the change in was to increase deferred policy acquisition costs by approximately million 
the change had no effect on the expense ratio 

table of contents review of underwriting results by business unit personal insurance net premiums written from personal insurance  which represented of our premiums written in  increased by in and in net premiums written for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment were as follows years ended december increase increase vs 
vs 
dollars in millions automobile homeowners other total personal personal automobile premiums in the us decreased in and due to an increasingly competitive marketplace 
the termination of a collector vehicle program also contributed to the decrease in the overall growth in personal automobile premiums in was due to selective initiatives outside the united states 
the growth in our homeowners business in both years was due primarily to increased insurance to value 
the in force policy count for this class of business was relatively flat over the period 
homeowners premiums in were reduced by reinsurance reinstatement premium costs of million related to hurricane katrina 
our other personal business includes insurance for excess liability  yacht and accident coverages 
the substantial growth in this business in was due primarily to a significant increase in accident premiums  particularly outside the united states 
excess liability premiums also grew  due in part to a modest increase in rates 
our personal insurance business produced highly profitable underwriting results in each of the last three years 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment were as follows years ended december automobile homeowners other total personal our personal automobile results were profitable in each of the past three years 
results in and were more profitable than in due to lower claim frequency and modest favorable prior year loss development 
homeowners results were highly profitable in each of the last three years 
results in all three years reflected adequate pricing and a reduction in water damage losses primarily as a result of policy wording changes related to mold coverage and loss remediation measures that we have implemented over the past several years 
results in benefited from lower catastrophe losses 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in other personal business produced modestly profitable results in each of the past three years 
our accident business was highly profitable in all three years 
our yacht business was profitable in and compared with unprofitable results in our excess liability business was unprofitable in each of the past three years  but more so in  due to inadequate pricing and unfavorable prior year loss development 

table of contents commercial insurance net premiums written from commercial insurance  which represented of our premiums written in  decreased by in and increased by in net premiums written for the classes of business within the commercial insurance segment were as follows years ended december increase increase decrease decrease vs 
vs 
dollars in millions multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial growth in our commercial classes in and was constrained due to an increasingly competitive marketplace 
in  renewal rates were generally stable but were under competitive pressure in some classes of business  particularly non catastrophe exposed property risks and certain casualty risks 
during  rates were down modestly 
certain classes of business and geographic areas  such as non catastrophe exposed property risks and large company risks  experienced more competitive pressure than others 
rate pressure increased in the second half of the year across all classes of business  particularly for new business 
multiple peril and property and marine premiums in were reduced by reinsurance reinstatement premium costs of million and million  respectively  related to hurricane katrina 
in  property and marine premiums benefited from a million reduction of previously accrued reinsurance reinstatement premium costs 
excluding the reinsurance reinstatement premiums  multiple peril premiums declined and property and marine premiums grew in compared with the prior year 
retention levels of our existing customers remained steady over the last three years 
new business volume was slightly higher in and again in compared with the respective prior years 
the increase in came from business outside the us the increase in was due to a few large accounts written in the first half of the year 
new business volume in the second half of was down as it became more difficult to find new opportunities at acceptable rates 
we have continued to maintain our underwriting discipline in the more competitive market  renewing business and writing new business only where we believe we are securing acceptable rates and appropriate terms and conditions for the exposures 
our commercial insurance business produced profitable underwriting results in each of the past three years  particularly in and results in all three years benefited from better terms and conditions and disciplined risk selection in recent years as well as low non catastrophe property losses 
results in were less profitable than in and  largely due to substantially higher catastrophe losses  primarily from hurricane katrina 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for our commercial insurance business in whereas such impact was percentage points in and negligible in 
table of contents the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within commercial insurance were as follows years ended december multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial multiple peril results were highly profitable in each of the past three years 
results in were less profitable than in and  largely due to higher catastrophe losses 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in the property component of this business benefited from low non catastrophe losses in all three years 
results in the liability component were profitable in all three years  particularly in results for our casualty business were similarly profitable in each of the past three years 
the automobile component of our casualty business deteriorated somewhat in but remained highly profitable 
results in the primary liability component were highly profitable in compared with marginally profitable results in and profitable results in results in the excess liability component were profitable in compared with unprofitable results in and excess liability results in benefited from favorable prior year loss development  whereas results in and were adversely affected by unfavorable loss development related to older accident years 
casualty results in were adversely affected by incurred losses related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
our analysis of these exposures resulted in an increase in our estimate of the ultimate liabilities for a small number of our insureds 
such losses represented percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for this class in the impact of such losses was not significant in or workers compensation results were highly profitable in each of the past three years 
results were more profitable in each succeeding year due to favorable claim cost trends  resulting in part from the positive effect of reforms in california 
results in all three years benefited from our disciplined risk selection during the past several years 
property and marine results were highly profitable in and compared with marginally profitable results in the less profitable results in were due to catastrophe losses  primarily from hurricane katrina 
catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio in and percentage points in the impact of catastrophes was negligible in excluding the impact of catastrophes  the combined ratio was  and in  and  respectively 
results in each year benefited from relatively few large non catastrophe losses 

table of contents specialty insurance net premiums written from specialty insurance  which represented of our premiums written in  were flat in and decreased by in compared with the respective prior years 
net premiums written for the classes of business within the specialty insurance segment were as follows years ended december increase increase decrease decrease vs 
vs 
dollars in millions professional liability surety total specialty the decline of premiums in and for the professional liability classes of business was due to the increasingly competitive pressure on rates  particularly in the directors and officers liability component  and our commitment to maintain underwriting discipline in this environment 
the decline in premiums in was exacerbated by the sale of renewal rights  effective july   on our hospital medical malpractice and managed care errors and omissions business 
renewal rates for the directors and officers liability class of business were down in and again in rates for professional liability classes other than directors and officers liability  which were generally stable in  trended downward in retention levels remained strong over the last three years 
new business volume declined in each of the past two years due to the increased competition in the marketplace 
we continued to get what we believe are acceptable rates and appropriate terms and conditions on both new business and renewals 
in line with our strategy in recent years of directing our focus to small and middle market publicly traded and privately held companies  the percentage of our book of business represented by large public companies has continued to decrease 
the growth in net premiums written for our surety business was substantial in both and about half of the growth in was due to the non renewal of a high excess reinsurance treaty during growth in was due primarily to a strong public sector construction economy 
however  growth slowed as the year progressed due in part to a more competitive rate environment 
we expect the increasingly competitive market to continue in our specialty insurance business produced profitable underwriting results in each of the last three years 
results were significantly more profitable in each succeeding year 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within specialty insurance were as follows years ended december professional liability surety total specialty results for our professional liability business improved substantially in and again in  producing highly profitable results in compared with profitable results in and near breakeven results in the fidelity class was highly profitable in each of the past three years due to favorable loss experience 
the results of the directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and fiduciary liability classes improved in and again in results in and  to a much lesser extent  benefited from favorable prior year loss development due to the recognition of the increasingly favorable loss trends we have been experiencing in recent years 
these trends were largely the result of a favorable business climate in recent years  lower policy limits and better terms 
table of contents and conditions 
conversely  results in were adversely affected by unfavorable loss development related to accident years prior to this adverse development was predominantly from claims relating to corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities 
for more information on prior year loss development  see property and casualty insurance loss reserves  prior year loss development 
our surety business produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years due to favorable loss experience 
this business tends to be characterized by infrequent but potentially high severity losses 
when losses occur  they are mitigated  at times  by recovery rights to the customer s assets  contract payments  collateral and bankruptcy recoveries 
the majority of our surety obligations are intended to be performance based guarantees 
we manage our exposure on an absolute basis and by specific bond type 
we have substantial commercial and construction surety exposure for current and prior customers  including exposures related to surety bonds issued on behalf of companies that have experienced deterioration in creditworthiness since we issued bonds to them 
we therefore may experience an increase in filed claims and may incur high severity losses 
such losses would be recognized if and when claims are filed and determined to be valid  and could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations 
reinsurance assumed in december  we completed a transaction involving a new bermuda based reinsurance company  harbor point limited 
as part of the transaction  we transferred our ongoing reinsurance assumed business and certain related assets  including renewal rights  to harbor point 
harbor point generally did not assume our reinsurance liabilities relating to reinsurance contracts incepting prior to december  we retained those liabilities and the related assets 
for a transition period of about two years  harbor point underwrote specific reinsurance business on our behalf 
we retained a portion of this business and ceded the balance to harbor point in return for a fronting commission 
we receive additional payments based on the amount of business renewed by harbor point 
these amounts are being recognized in income as earned 
net premiums written from our reinsurance assumed business  which represented of our premiums written in  decreased by in and in the significant decrease in premiums in both years was expected in light of the sale of our ongoing reinsurance assumed business to harbor point 
premiums in included net reinsurance reinstatement premium revenue of million related to hurricane katrina 
reinsurance assumed results were profitable in each of the past three years  particularly in and while the volume of business declined substantially in each of the past two years  results in both years benefited from significant favorable prior year loss development 
results in were adversely affected by catastrophe losses related to hurricane katrina 
regulatory developments to promote and distribute our insurance products  we rely on independent brokers and agents 
accordingly  our business is dependent on the willingness of these brokers and agents to recommend our products to their customers 
prior to  we had agreements in place with certain insurance agents and brokers under which  in addition to the standard commissions that we pay  we agreed to pay commissions that were contingent on the volume and or the profitability of business placed with us 
we have been involved in the investigations of certain business practices in the property and casualty insurance industry by various attorneys general and other regulatory authorities of several states  the us securities and exchange commission  the us attorney for the southern district of new york and certain non us regulatory authorities with respect to  among other things  potential conflicts of interest and anti competitive behavior arising from the payment of contingent commissions to brokers and agents and loss mitigation and finite reinsurance arrangements 
in 
table of contents connection with these investigations  we received subpoenas and other requests for information from various regulators 
we have been cooperating fully with these investigations 
in december  we settled with the attorneys general of new york  connecticut and illinois all issues arising out of their investigations 
as part of this settlement  we agreed to implement certain business reforms  including discontinuing the payment of contingent commissions in the united states on all insurance lines beginning in in august  the attorney general of ohio filed an action against us  as well as several other insurers and one broker  as a result of the ohio attorney general s business practices investigation 
although no other attorney general or regulator has initiated an action against us  it is possible that such an action may be brought against us with respect to some or all of the issues that are the focus of the ongoing investigations described above 
chubb and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in various legal proceedings brought by private plaintiffs arising out of these investigations 
these legal proceedings and the litigation brought by the ohio attorney general referred to above are further described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we cannot predict at this time the ultimate outcome of the ongoing investigations and legal proceedings referred to above  including any potential amounts that we may be required to pay in connection with them 
nevertheless  management believes that it is likely that the outcome will not have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations or financial condition 
catastrophe risk management our property and casualty subsidiaries have exposure to losses caused by natural perils such as hurricanes and other windstorms  earthquakes  severe winter weather and brush fires and from man made catastrophic events such as terrorism 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
natural catastrophes the extent of losses from a natural catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we regularly assess our concentration of risk exposures in catastrophe exposed areas globally and have strategies and underwriting standards to manage this exposure through individual risk selection  subject to regulatory constraints  and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
we have invested in modeling technologies and a risk concentration management tool that allow us to monitor and control our accumulations of potential losses in catastrophe exposed areas in the united states  such as california and the gulf and east coasts  as well as in such areas in other countries 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the model 
we also continue to actively explore and analyze credible scientific evidence  including the impact of global climate change  that may affect our ability to manage exposure under the insurance policies we issue 
despite these efforts  the occurrence of one or more severe natural catastrophic events in heavily populated areas could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
terrorism risk and legislation the september  attack changed the way the property and casualty insurance industry views catastrophic risk 
that tragic event demonstrated that numerous classes of business we write are subject to terrorism related catastrophic risks in addition to the catastrophic risks related to natural occurrences 
this  together with the limited availability of terrorism reinsurance  has required us to change how we identify and evaluate risk accumulations 
we have licensed a terrorism model that 
table of contents provides loss estimates under numerous event scenarios 
also  the above noted risk concentration management tool enables us to identify locations and geographic areas that are exposed to risk accumulations

actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the model 
the terrorism risk insurance act of tria established a temporary program under which the federal government will share the risk of loss arising from certain acts of foreign terrorism with the insurance industry 
the program  which was applicable to most lines of commercial business  was scheduled to terminate on december  in december  tria was extended through december  certain lines of business previously subject to the provisions of tria  including commercial automobile  surety and professional liability insurance  other than directors and officers liability  were excluded from the program 
in december  tria was extended through december  the amended law eliminated the distinction between foreign and domestic acts of terrorism  now providing protection from all acts of terrorism 
otherwise  there were no significant changes to the key features of the program 
as a precondition to recovery under tria  insurance companies with direct commercial insurance exposure in the united states for tria lines of business are required to make insurance for covered acts of terrorism available under their policies 
each insurer has a separate deductible that it must meet in the event of an act of terrorism before federal assistance becomes available 
the deductible is based on a percentage of direct us earned premiums for the covered lines of business in the previous calendar year 
for  that deductible is of direct premiums earned in for these lines of business 
for losses above the deductible  the federal government will pay for of covered losses  while the insurer retains 
there is a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of billion 
if acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the billion annual limit  insurers are not liable for additional losses 
while the provisions of tria will serve to mitigate our exposure in the event of a large scale terrorist attack  our deductible is substantial  approximating billion in for certain classes of business  such as workers compensation  terrorism insurance is mandatory 
for those classes of business where it is not mandatory  policyholders may choose not to accept terrorism insurance  which would  subject to other statutory or regulatory restrictions  reduce our exposure 
we will continue to manage this type of catastrophic risk by monitoring terrorism risk aggregations 
nevertheless  given the unpredictability of the targets  frequency and severity of potential terrorist events as well as the very limited terrorism reinsurance coverage available in the market  the occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
we also have exposure outside the united states to risk of loss from acts of terrorism 
in some jurisdictions  we have access to government mechanisms that would mitigate our exposure 

table of contents loss reserves unpaid losses and loss expenses  also referred to as loss reserves  are the largest liability of our property and casualty subsidiaries 
our loss reserves include case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims  less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries 
estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as prevailing economic  legal and social conditions 
our loss reserves are not discounted to present value 
we regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of actuarial techniques 
we update the reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops  additional claims are reported and or settled and new information becomes available 
any changes in estimates are reflected in operating results in the period in which the estimates are changed 
incurred but not reported ibnr reserves represent the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of all claims that have occurred and the reported losses and loss expenses 
reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves 
the ibnr reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us  some of which are not yet known to the insured  as well as a provision for future development on reported claims 
a relatively large proportion of our net loss reserves  particularly for long tail liability classes  are reserves for ibnr losses 
in fact  more than of our aggregate net loss reserves at december  were for ibnr losses 
our gross case and ibnr loss reserves and related reinsurance recoverable by class of business were as follows gross loss reserves net reinsurance loss december  case ibnr total recoverable reserves in millions personal insurance automobile homeowners other total personal commercial insurance multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial specialty insurance professional liability surety total specialty total insurance reinsurance assumed total 
table of contents gross loss reserves net reinsurance loss december  case ibnr total recoverable reserves in millions personal insurance automobile homeowners other total personal commercial insurance multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial specialty insurance professional liability surety total specialty total insurance reinsurance assumed total loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by million or in loss reserves related to our insurance business increased by million  including approximately million related to currency fluctuation due to the weakness of the us dollar 
loss reserves related to our reinsurance assumed business  which is in runoff  decreased by million 
gross case reserves related to the professional liability classes decreased by million in due to generally low reported loss activity as well as settlements related to previously existing case reserves 
the million decrease in reinsurance recoverable in the professional liability classes was due primarily to the discontinuation of the professional liability per risk treaty in and the settlement of claims related to years prior to in establishing the loss reserves of our property and casualty subsidiaries  we consider facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
based on all information currently available  we believe that the aggregate loss reserves at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred as of that date  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
however  as described below  there are significant uncertainties inherent in the loss reserving process 
it is therefore possible that management s estimate of the ultimate liability for losses that had occurred as of december  may change  which could have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
estimates and uncertainties the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 

table of contents due to the inherent complexity of the loss reserving process and the potential variability of the assumptions used  the actual emergence of losses could vary  perhaps substantially  from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements  particularly when settlements may not occur until well into the future 
our net loss reserves at december  were billion 
therefore  a relatively small percentage change in the estimate of net loss reserves would have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations 
reserves other than those relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
short tail classes consist principally of homeowners  commercial property and marine business 
for these classes  claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs and the claims relate to tangible property 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is less complex 
most of our loss reserves relate to long tail liability classes of business 
long tail classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and other professional liability coverages  commercial primary and excess liability  workers compensation and other liability coverages 
for many liability claims significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim 
as a result  loss experience in the more recent accident years for the long tail liability classes has limited statistical credibility because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses 
an accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred or  in the case of claims made policies  the calendar year in which a loss is reported 
liability claims are also more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is more complex and typically subject to a higher degree of variability than for short tail classes 
most of our reinsurance assumed business is long tail casualty reinsurance 
reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to the variability caused by extended loss emergence periods 
the estimation of loss reserves for this business is further complicated by delays between the time the claim is reported to the ceding insurer and when it is reported by the ceding insurer to us and by our dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting by the ceding company 
our actuaries perform a comprehensive annual review of loss reserves for each of the numerous classes of business we write prior to the determination of the year end carried reserves 
the review process takes into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims in each particular class of business 
a similar  but somewhat less comprehensive  review is performed for the major classes of business prior to the determination of the june carried reserves 
prior to the determination of the march and september carried reserves  our actuaries review the emergence of paid and reported losses relative to expectations and  as necessary  conduct reserve reviews for particular classes of business 
the loss reserve estimation process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes 
as part of that process  our actuaries use a variety of actuarial methods that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
the principal standard actuarial methods used by our actuaries in the loss reserve reviews include loss development factor methods  expected loss ratio methods  bornheutter ferguson methods and frequency severity methods 
loss development factor methods generally assume that the losses yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss amount observed so far 
historical patterns of the 
table of contents development of paid and reported losses by accident year are applied to current paid and reported losses to generate estimated ultimate losses by accident year 
expected loss ratio methods use loss ratios for prior accident years  adjusted to reflect our evaluation of recent loss trends  the current risk environment  changes in our book of business and changes in our pricing and underwriting  to determine the appropriate expected loss ratio for a given accident year 
the expected loss ratio for each accident year is multiplied by the earned premiums for that year to calculate estimated ultimate losses 
bornheutter ferguson methods are combinations of an expected loss ratio method and a loss development factor method  where the loss development factor method is given more weight as an accident year matures 
frequency severity methods first project ultimate claim counts using one or more of the other methods described above and then multiply those counts by an estimated average claim cost to calculate estimated ultimate losses 
the average claim costs are often estimated by fitting historical severity data to an observed trend 
generally  these methods work best for high frequency  low severity classes of business 
in completing their loss reserve analysis  our actuaries are required to determine the most appropriate actuarial methods to employ for each class of business 
within each class  the business is further segregated by accident year and generally by jurisdiction 
each estimation method has its own pattern  parameter and or judgmental dependencies  with no estimation method being better than the others in all situations 
the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various estimation methods when applied to a particular class of business can also change over time  depending on the underlying circumstances 
in many cases  multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the relevant class of business 
the manner of application and the degree of reliance on a given method will vary by class of business  by accident year and by jurisdiction based on our actuaries evaluation of the above dependencies and the potential volatility of the loss frequency and severity patterns 
the estimation methods selected or given weight by our actuaries at a particular valuation date are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication for the loss reserves being evaluated 
these selections incorporate input from claims personnel  pricing actuaries and underwriting management on loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates 
for short tail classes  the emergence of paid and incurred losses generally exhibits a reasonably stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next 
thus  for these classes  the loss development factor method is generally relatively straightforward to apply and usually requires only modest extrapolation 
for long tail classes  applying the loss development factor method often requires more judgment in selecting development factors as well as more significant extrapolation 
for those long tail classes with high frequency and relatively low per loss severity eg workers compensation  volatility will often be sufficiently modest for the loss development factor method to be given significant weight  except in the most recent accident years 
for certain long tail classes of business  however  anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and erratic claim severity patterns 
these classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and commercial excess liability  among others 
for these classes  the loss development factor methods may not produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses in the most recent accident years since many claims either have not yet been reported to us or are only in the early stages of the settlement process 
therefore  the actuarial estimates for these accident years are based on less extrapolatory methods  such as expected loss ratio and bornheutter ferguson methods 
over time  as a greater number of claims are reported and the statistical credibility of loss experience increases  loss development factor methods are given increasingly more weight 
using all the available data  our actuaries select an indicated loss reserve amount for each class of business based on the various assumptions  projections and methods 
the total indicated reserve 
table of contents amount determined by our actuaries is an aggregate of the indicated reserve amounts for the individual classes of business 
the ultimate outcome is likely to fall within a range of potential outcomes around this indicated amount  but the indicated amount is not expected to be precisely the ultimate liability 
senior management meets with our actuaries at the end of each quarter to review the results of the latest loss reserve analysis 
based on this review  management determines the carried reserve for each class of business 
in making the determination  management considers numerous factors  such as changes in actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past and the level of volatility within a particular class of business 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment 
it is often not possible to determine whether a change in the data represents credible actionable information or an anomaly 
even if a change is determined to be permanent  it is not always possible to determine the extent of the change until sometime later 
as a result  there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the carried loss reserves 
in general  changes are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile classes of business 
among the numerous factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves are the following changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care and home repair costs  changes in the judicial interpretation of policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage  changes in the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages  legislative actions  changes in the medical condition of claimants  changes in our estimates of the number and or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statements  changes in our book of business  changes in our underwriting standards  and changes in our claim handling procedures 
in addition  we must consider the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as legal  judicial and social conditions change 
these issues have had  and may continue to have  a negative effect on our loss reserves by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
recent examples of such issues include the number of directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claims arising out of the ongoing credit crisis  the number of directors and officers liability claims arising out of stock option backdating practices by certain public companies  the number and size of directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claims arising out of investment banking practices and accounting and other corporate malfeasance  and exposure to claims asserted for bodily injury as a result of long term exposure to harmful products or substances 
as a result of issues such as these  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience have grown  further complicating the already complex loss reserving process 
as part of our loss reserving analysis  we take into consideration the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process 
those factors that could materially affect our loss reserve estimates include loss development patterns and loss cost trends  rate and exposure level changes  the effects of changes in coverage and policy limits  business mix shifts  the effects of regulatory and legislative developments  the effects of changes in judicial interpretations  the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues and the effects of changes in claim 
table of contents handling practices 
in making estimates of reserves  however  we do not necessarily make an explicit assumption for each of these factors 
moreover  all estimation methods do not utilize the same assumptions and typically no single method is determinative in the reserve analysis for a class of business 
consequently  changes in our loss reserve estimates generally are not the result of changes in any one assumption 
instead  the variability will be affected by the interplay of changes in numerous assumptions  many of which are implicit to the approaches used 
for each class of business  we regularly adjust the assumptions and actuarial methods used in the estimation of loss reserves in response to our actual loss experience as well as our judgments regarding changes in trends and or emerging patterns 
in those instances where we primarily utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses  this may be reflected  for example  in the selection of revised loss development factors 
in those long tail classes of business that comprise a majority of our loss reserves and for which loss experience is less predictable due to potential changes in judicial interpretations  potential legislative actions and potential claims issues  this may be reflected in a judgmental change in our estimate of ultimate losses for particular accident years 
the future impact of the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process is extremely difficult to predict 
there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves  particularly for long tail classes of business 
we do not derive statistical loss distributions or outcome confidence levels around our loss reserve estimate 
actuarial ranges of reasonable estimates are not a true reflection of the potential volatility between carried loss reserves and the ultimate settlement amount of losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date 
this is due  among other reasons  to the fact that actuarial ranges are developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas the ultimate disposition of losses is subject to the outcome of events and circumstances that were unknown as of the valuation date 
the following discussion includes disclosure of possible variation from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key assumptions for particular classes of business 
these impacts are estimated individually  without consideration for any correlation among such assumptions or among lines of business 
therefore  it would be inappropriate to take the amounts and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for our loss reserves in total 
we believe that the estimated variation in reserves detailed below is a reasonable estimate of the possible variation that may occur in the future 
however  if such variation did occur  it would likely occur over a period of several years and therefore its impact on the corporation s results of operations would be spread over the same period 
it is important to note  however  that there is the potential for future variation greater than the amounts discussed below 
two of the larger components of our loss reserves relate to the professional liability classes other than fidelity and to commercial excess liability 
the respective reported loss development patterns are key assumptions in estimating loss reserves for these classes of business  both as applied directly to more mature accident years and as applied indirectly eg  via bornheutter ferguson methods to less mature accident years 
reserves for the professional liability classes other than fidelity were billion  net of reinsurance  at december  based on a review of our loss experience  if the loss development factor for each accident year changed such that the cumulative loss development factor for the most recent accident year changed by  we estimate that the net reserves for professional liability classes other than fidelity would change by approximately million  in either direction 
this degree of change in the reported loss development pattern is within the historical variation around the averages in our data 
reserves for commercial excess liability excluding asbestos and toxic waste claims were billion  net of reinsurance  at december  these reserves are included within commercial casualty 
based on a review of our loss experience  if the loss development factor for each accident year changed such that the cumulative loss development factor for the most recent accident year 
table of contents changed by  we estimate that the net reserves for commercial excess liability would change by approximately million  in either direction 
this degree of change in the reported loss development pattern is within the historical variation around the averages in our data 
reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability 
the insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional actuarial loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors 
instead  we rely on an exposure based analysis that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures 
because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues  we generally evaluate our exposure on a policyholder by policyholder basis  considering a variety of factors that are unique to each policyholder 
quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including management s judgment 
we establish case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves are established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
we believe that the loss reserves carried at december  for asbestos and toxic waste claims were adequate 
however  given the judicial decisions and legislative actions that have broadened the scope of coverage and expanded theories of liability in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  it is possible that our estimate of loss reserves relating to these exposures may increase in future periods as new information becomes available and as claims develop 
asbestos reserves 
asbestos remains the most significant and difficult mass tort for the insurance industry in terms of claims volume and dollar exposure 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
tort theory affecting asbestos litigation has evolved over the years 
early court cases established the continuous trigger theory with respect to insurance coverage 
under this theory  insurance coverage is deemed to be triggered from the time a claimant is first exposed to asbestos until the manifestation of any disease 
this interpretation of a policy trigger can involve insurance policies over many years and increases insurance companies exposure to liability 
until recently  judicial interpretations and legislative actions attempted to maximize insurance availability from both a coverage and liability standpoint 
new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims have continued despite the fact that usage of asbestos has declined since the mid s 
many claimants were exposed to multiple asbestos products over an extended period of time 
as a result  claim filings typically name dozens of defendants 
the plaintiffs bar has solicited new claimants through extensive advertising and through asbestos medical screenings 
a vast majority of asbestos bodily injury claims have been filed by claimants who do not show any signs of asbestos related disease 
new asbestos cases are often filed in those jurisdictions with a reputation for judges and juries that are extremely sympathetic to plaintiffs 
approximately manufacturers and distributors of asbestos products have filed for bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities 
a bankruptcy sometimes involves an agreement to a plan between the debtor and its creditors  including current and future asbestos claimants 
although the debtor is negotiating in part with its insurers money  insurers are generally given only limited opportunity to be heard 
in addition to contributing to the overall number of claims  bankruptcy proceedings have also caused increased settlement demands against remaining solvent defendants 

table of contents there have been some positive legislative and judicial developments in the asbestos environment over the past several years various challenges to mass screening claimants have been mounted  including a june us district court decision in texas 
many believe that this decision is leading to higher medical evidentiary standards 
for example  several asbestos injury settlement trusts suspended their acceptance of claims that were based on the diagnosis of physicians or screening companies named in the case  citing concerns about their reliability 
further investigations of the medical screening process for asbestos claims are underway 
a number of states have implemented legislative and judicial reforms that focus the courts resources on the claims of the most seriously injured 
those who allege serious injury and can present credible evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts  while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or are placed on an inactive docket  which preserves the right to pursue litigation in the future 
a number of key jurisdictions have adopted venue reform that requires plaintiffs to have a connection to the jurisdiction in order to file a complaint 
in recognition that many aspects of bankruptcy plans are unfair to certain classes of claimants and to the insurance industry  these plans are beginning to be closely scrutinized by the courts and rejected when appropriate 
our most significant individual asbestos exposures involve products liability on the part of traditional defendants who were engaged in the manufacture  distribution or installation of asbestos products 
we wrote excess liability and or general liability coverages for these insureds 
while these insureds are relatively few in number  their exposure has become substantial due to the increased volume of claims  the erosion of the underlying limits and the bankruptcies of target defendants 
our other asbestos exposures involve products and non products liability on the part of peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers  distributors and installers of certain products that contain asbestos in small quantities and owners or operators of properties where asbestos was present 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
as the financial resources of traditional asbestos defendants have been depleted  plaintiffs are targeting these viable peripheral parties with greater frequency and  in many cases  for large awards 
asbestos claims against the major manufacturers  distributors or installers of asbestos products were typically presented under the products liability section of primary general liability policies as well as under excess liability policies  both of which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer s exposure 
in recent years  a number of asbestos claims by insureds are being presented as non products claims  such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property  under the premises or operations section of primary general liability policies 
unlike products exposures  these non products exposures typically had no aggregate limits on coverage  creating potentially greater exposure 
further  in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage  some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits 
it is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non products coverage or whether insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses 
accordingly  the ultimate cost to insurers of the claims for coverage not subject to aggregate limits is uncertain 
in establishing our asbestos reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider a variety of factors including the available insurance coverage  limits and deductibles  the jurisdictions involved  past settlement values of similar claims  the potential role of other insurance  particularly underlying coverage below our excess liability policies  potential 
table of contents bankruptcy impact  relevant judicial interpretations  and applicable coverage defenses  including asbestos exclusions 
we have assumed a continuing unfavorable legal environment with no benefit from any federal asbestos reform legislation 
various federal proposals to solve the ongoing asbestos litigation crisis have been considered by the us congress over the past few years  but none have yet been enacted 
thus  the prospect of federal asbestos reform legislation remains uncertain 
our actuaries and claim personnel perform periodic analyses of our asbestos related exposures 
the analyses during noted an increase in our estimate of the ultimate liabilities for two of our asbestos defendants 
the analyses during noted positive developments  including several settlements  related to certain of our traditional asbestos defendants 
at the same time  the analyses indicated that our exposure to loss from claims against our peripheral defendants was somewhat higher than previously expected 
the analyses during noted an increase in our estimate of the ultimate liabilities related to certain of our traditional asbestos defendants 
based on these analyses  we increased our net asbestos loss reserves by million in  million in and million in the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves related to asbestos claims

number of net loss net losses policyholders reserves paid in millions traditional defendants peripheral defendants future claims from unknown policyholders significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability related to asbestos related claims 
this uncertainty is due to several factors including the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims  plaintiffs increased focus on peripheral defendants  the volume of claims by unimpaired plaintiffs and the extent to which they can be precluded from making claims  
table of contents the efforts by insureds to claim the right to non products coverage not subject to aggregate limits  the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities  the ability of claimants to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure  the impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in claims on excess liability policies we have issued  inconsistent court decisions and diverging legal interpretations  and the possibility  however remote  of federal legislation that would address the asbestos problem 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
toxic waste reserves 
toxic waste claims relate primarily to pollution and related cleanup costs 
our insureds have two potential areas of exposure hazardous waste dump sites and pollution at the insured site primarily from underground storage tanks and manufacturing processes 
the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund has been interpreted to impose strict  retroactive and joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties prps for the cost of remediating hazardous waste sites 
most sites have multiple prps 
most prps named to date are parties who have been generators  transporters  past or present landowners or past or present site operators 
these prps had proper government authorization in many instances 
however  relative fault has not been a factor in establishing liability 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover the clean up costs of pollution and  in many cases  did not intend to cover the pollution itself 
in more recent years  however  policies specifically excluded such exposures 
as the costs of environmental clean up became substantial  prps and others increasingly filed claims with their insurance carriers 
litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 
there is substantial uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims 
first  the liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given waste site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly depending on a variety of factors 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future 
uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  and has not been re enacted 
federal legislation appears to be at a standstill 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
without federal movement on superfund reform  the enforcement of superfund liability has occasionally shifted to the states 
states are being forced to reconsider state level cleanup statutes and regulations 
as individual states move forward  the potential for conflicting state regulation becomes greater 
in a few states  we have seen cases brought against insureds or directly against insurance companies for environmental pollution and natural resources damages 
to date  only a few natural resource claims have been filed and they are being vigorously defended 
significant uncertainty remains as to the cost of remediating the state sites 
because of the large number of state sites  such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than superfund sites 

table of contents in establishing our toxic waste reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider a variety of factors including the probable liability  available insurance coverage  past settlement values of similar claims  relevant judicial interpretations  applicable coverage defenses as well as facts that are unique to each insured 
uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability relating to toxic waste claims 
however  toxic waste losses appear to be developing as expected due to relatively stable claim trends 
in many cases  claims are being settled for less than initially anticipated due to more efficient site remediation efforts 
in other cases  we have been successful at buying back our policies  thus removing the threat of additional losses in the future 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  related to toxic waste claims 
the reinsurance recoverable related to these claims is minimal 
years ended december in millions reserves  beginning of year incurred losses losses paid reserves  end of year of the net toxic waste loss reserves at december   million was ibnr reserves 
reinsurance recoverable 
reinsurance recoverable is the estimated amount recoverable from reinsurers related to the losses we have incurred 
at december   reinsurance recoverable included million recoverable with respect to paid losses and loss expenses  which is included in other assets  and billion recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses 
reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses represents an estimate of the portion of our gross loss reserves that will be recovered from reinsurers 
such reinsurance recoverable is estimated as part of our loss reserving process using assumptions that are consistent with the assumptions used in estimating the gross loss reserves 
consequently  the estimation of reinsurance recoverable is subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves 
ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve our primary obligation to our policyholders 
consequently  an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities assumed under the reinsurance contracts 
we are selective in regard to our reinsurers  placing reinsurance with only those reinsurers who we believe have strong balance sheets and superior underwriting ability  and we monitor the financial strength of our reinsurers on an ongoing basis 
nevertheless  in recent years  certain of our reinsurers have experienced financial difficulties or exited the reinsurance business 
in addition  we may become involved in coverage disputes with our reinsurers 
a provision for estimated uncollectible reinsurance is recorded based on periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers  the financial condition of the reinsurers  coverage disputes and other relevant factors 
prior year loss development because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events  changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed 
reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening 
reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development or reserve releases

while these accident years are somewhat immature  we concluded that 
table of contents there was sufficient evidence to modestly decrease the expected loss ratios for these accident years 
the fact that our initial estimates for accident years and subsequent are developing favorably was recognized as one factor among several factors in the determination of loss reserves for the accident year for these classes 
other factors included the specific aspects of the current claim environment and the recent downward trend in prices 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the short tail homeowners and commercial property classes  primarily related to the and accident years 
this favorable development arose from the lower than expected emergence of actual losses during relative to expectations used to establish our loss reserves at the end of the severity of late reported property claims that emerged during was lower than expected and case development  including salvage recoveries  on previously reported claims was better than expected 
because the incidence of property losses is subject to a considerable element of fortuity  reserve estimates for these classes are based on an analysis of past loss experience on average over a period of years 
as a result  the favorable development in was recognized but had a relatively modest effect on our determination of carried property loss reserves at december  we experienced favorable development of about million in the run off of our reinsurance assumed business due primarily to better than expected reported loss activity from cedants 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the fidelity class and million in the surety class due to lower than expected reported loss emergence  mainly related to more recent accident years 
loss reserve estimates at the end of in these classes included an expectation of more large late reported losses than actually occurred in however  since we would still expect such losses to occur in a typical year  factors that resulted in the favorable development in were given only modest weight in our determination of carried fidelity and surety loss reserves at december  we experienced favorable development of about million in the personal automobile class 
case development during on previously reported claims was better than expected  reflecting improved case management 
also  the number of late reported claims was less than expected  reflecting a continuation of recent generally favorable frequency trends 
both of these factors were reflected in the determination of the carried loss reserves for this class at december  we experienced adverse development of about million in the commercial liability classes 
adverse development in accident years prior to  mostly the million related to asbestos and toxic waste claims  was largely offset by favorable development in these classes in the more recent accident years 
the asbestos and toxic waste loss activity primarily related to specific individual excess liability claims and did not change our overall assessment of recent trends 
therefore  this adverse development had little overall effect on our determination of carried loss reserves for these classes at december  the net favorable development of million in was also due to various factors 
the most significant factors were we experienced favorable development of about million in the short tail homeowners and commercial property classes  primarily related to the accident year

while these accident years are somewhat immature  we concluded that there was sufficient evidence to modestly decrease the expected loss ratios for these accident years 
on the other hand  we continued to experience significant reported loss activity related to the through accident years  largely from claims related to corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities 
as a result  we increased the expected loss ratios for these accident years

case development during on previously reported claims was better than expected  reflecting improved case management 
also  the number of late reported claims was less than expected  reflecting a continuation of recent generally favorable frequency trends

the adverse development was primarily due to reported loss activity in accident years prior to that was worse than expected  primarily related to specific individual excess liability and other liability claims 
the net unfavorable development of million in was due to various factors 
the most significant were we experienced adverse development of about million in the professional liability classes other than fidelity

in item of this report  we present an analysis of our consolidated loss reserve development on a calendar year basis for each of the ten years prior to the variability in reserve development over the ten year period illustrates the uncertainty of the loss reserving process 
our us property and casualty subsidiaries are required to file annual statements with insurance regulatory authorities prepared on an accounting basis prescribed or permitted by such authorities 
these annual statements include an analysis of loss reserves  referred to as schedule p  that presents accident year loss development information by line of business for the nine years prior to it is our intention to post the schedule p for our combined us property and casualty subsidiaries on our website as soon as it becomes available 

table of contents investment results property and casualty investment income before taxes increased by in compared with and by in compared with growth in both years was due to an increase in invested assets  which reflected substantial cash flow from operations over the period 
the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in while similar in these years  the effective tax rate does fluctuate as a result of our holding a different proportion of our investment portfolio in tax exempt securities during different periods 
on an after tax basis  property and casualty investment income increased by in and in the after tax annualized yield on the investment portfolio that supports our property and casualty insurance business was in compared with in and in management uses property and casualty investment income after tax  a non gaap financial measure  to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax 
other income and charges other income and charges  which include miscellaneous income and expenses of the property and casualty subsidiaries  were not significant in the last three years 
corporate and other corporate and other comprises investment income earned on corporate invested assets  interest expense and other expenses not allocated to our operating subsidiaries  and the results of our real estate and other non insurance subsidiaries  including chubb financial solutions cfs  which provided customized financial products to corporate clients and has been in run off since april corporate and other produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the higher loss in compared with was due primarily to higher interest expense as a result of the issuance of billion of new debt during the first half of the higher interest expense was only modestly offset by an increase in investment income as a substantial portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the debt was used to repurchase chubb s common stock 
the lower loss in compared with was primarily due to a significantly smaller loss in our real estate operation and higher investment income 
the growth in investment income in was due to an increase in corporate invested assets  resulting from the issuance of chubb s common stock upon the settlement of equity unit warrants and purchase contracts and under stock based employee compensation plans 
real estate real estate operations resulted in a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million in and million in the large loss in was due to the recognition of a significant impairment loss 
during  we committed to a plan to sell a parcel of land in new jersey that we had previously intended to hold and develop 
the decision to sell the property was based on our assessment of the current real estate market and our concern about zoning issues 
as a result of our decision to sell this property  we reassessed the recoverability of its carrying value 
based on our reassessment  we recognized an impairment loss of million during the year to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
real estate revenues were million in  million in and million in the higher revenues in were due to the sale of one commercial property for approximately million 

table of contents at december   we owned approximately million of land and million of commercial properties and land parcels under lease 
management believes that it has made adequate provisions for impairment of real estate assets 
chubb financial solutions cfs s business was primarily structured credit derivatives  principally as a counterparty in portfolio credit default swap contracts 
in april  the corporation announced its intention to exit cfs s business 
since that date  cfs has terminated early or run off nearly all of its contractual obligations within its financial products portfolio 
the credit derivatives are carried in the financial statements at estimated fair value  which represents management s best estimate of the cost to exit the positions 
changes in fair value are recognized in income in the period of the change 
cfs s results were near breakeven in and compared with a loss before taxes of million in the loss in related to the termination of a principal and interest guarantee contract 
cfs s aggregate exposure  or retained risk  from each of its remaining in force financial products contracts is referred to as notional amount 
notional amounts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual cash flows and are not necessarily representative of the potential for gain or loss 
the notional amounts are not recorded on the balance sheet 
cfs s remaining financial products contracts at december  included one credit default swap  a derivative contract linked to an equity market index that terminates in and a few other insignificant transactions 
we estimate that the notional amount under the remaining contracts was about million and the fair value of our future obligations was million at december  realized investment gains and losses net investment gains realized were as follows years ended december in millions net realized gains losses equity securities fixed maturities other invested assets transfer of reinsurance assumed business personal lines insurance brokerage other than temporary impairment losses equity securities fixed maturities realized investment gains before tax realized investment gains after tax the net realized gains on other invested assets represent the aggregate of distributions to us from the limited partnerships in which we have an interest and changes in our equity in the net assets of the partnerships based on valuations provided to us by the manager of each partnership 
as a result of the timing of our receipt of valuation data from the investment managers  these investments are reported on a three month lag 

table of contents in  we transferred our ongoing reinsurance business and certain related assets to harbor point limited 
in exchange  we received from harbor point million of convertible notes and warrants to purchase common stock of harbor point 
the notes and warrants represented in the aggregate on a fully diluted basis approximately of the new company 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of million  of which million was recognized as a realized investment gain in the remaining gain of million was deferred and will be recognized based on the timing of the ultimate disposition of our economic interest in harbor point 
in  we completed the sale of personal lines insurance brokerage  inc based on the terms of the sale  we recognized a gain of million 
decisions to sell equity securities and fixed maturities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences 
as a result  realized gains and losses on the sale of these investments may vary significantly from period to period 
however  such gains and losses generally have little  if any  impact on shareholders equity as all of these investments are carried at fair value  with the unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflected in comprehensive income 
a primary reason for the sale of fixed maturities in each of the last three years has been to improve our after tax portfolio return without sacrificing quality where market opportunities have existed to do so 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  to reduce our income tax liability  we engaged in a program to sell taxable and tax exempt fixed maturities to generate realized losses to offset a portion of the gain related to the harbor point transaction 
we regularly review those invested assets whose fair value is less than cost to determine if an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
in evaluating whether a decline in value of any investment is temporary or other than temporary  we consider various quantitative criteria and qualitative factors including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments  our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow us to recover our cost  general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors 
if a decline in the fair value of an individual security is deemed to be other than temporary  the difference between cost and estimated fair value is charged to income as a realized investment loss 
the fair value of the investment becomes its new cost basis 
the decision to recognize a decline in the value of a security carried at fair value as other than temporary rather than temporary has no impact on shareholders equity 
during  our investments in several equity securities and one fixed maturity holding were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
we determined that the equity securities were not likely to recover to our cost basis over a near term period and we were not likely to collect all contractually obligated amounts due us under the terms of the fixed maturity investment 
information related to investment securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and is included in note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes as a result of progress toward the settlement of certain tax matters  we recognized a million tax benefit in the third quarter of in connection with the sale of a subsidiary a number of years ago  we agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain pre closing tax liabilities 
during the first quarter of  we settled this obligation with the purchaser 
accordingly  we reduced our income tax liability  which resulted in the recognition of a benefit of million

in connection with our long term capital strategy  chubb from time to time contributes capital to its property and casualty subsidiaries 
in addition  in order to satisfy capital needs as a result of any rating agency capital adequacy or other future rating issues  or in the event we were to need additional capital to make strategic investments in light of market opportunities  we may take a variety of actions  which could include the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities

ratings chubb and its insurance subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies 
these ratings reflect the rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders

the following table summarizes our property and casualty subsidiaries financial strength ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of february  am best standard poor s moody s fitch financial strength a aa aa aa ratings are an important factor in establishing our competitive position in the insurance markets 
there can be no assurance that our ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
it is possible that one or more of the rating agencies may raise or lower our existing ratings in the future 
if our credit ratings were downgraded  we might incur higher borrowing costs and might have more limited means to access capital 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings could adversely affect the competitive position of our insurance operations  including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
the corporation s liquidity requirements in the past have been met by funds from operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper and debt and equity securities 
we expect that our liquidity requirements in the future will be met by these sources of funds or borrowings from our credit facility 
our property and casualty operations provide liquidity in that premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to chubb 
after satisfying our cash requirements  excess cash flows are used to build the investment portfolio and thereby increase future investment income 
our strong underwriting results continued to generate substantial new cash in new cash from operations available for investment by the property and casualty subsidiaries was approximately billion in compared with billion in and billion in new cash available was lower in than in due to a million increase in dividends paid by the property and casualty subsidiaries to chubb and  to a lesser extent  higher income tax payments 
new cash available was lower in than in due primarily to substantially higher income tax payments and lower premium receipts 

table of contents our property and casualty subsidiaries maintain substantial investments in highly liquid  short term marketable securities 
accordingly  we do not anticipate selling long term fixed maturity investments to meet any liquidity needs 
chubb s liquidity requirements primarily include the payment of dividends to shareholders and interest and principal on debt obligations 
the declaration and payment of future dividends to chubb s shareholders will be at the discretion of chubb s board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including our operating results  financial condition  capital requirements and any regulatory constraints 
as a holding company  chubb s ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders and to satisfy its debt obligations relies on the availability of liquid assets  which is dependent in large part on the dividend paying ability of its property and casualty subsidiaries 
our property and casualty subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate that restrict the amount of dividends they may pay without the prior approval of regulatory authorities 
the restrictions are generally based on net income and on certain levels of policyholders surplus as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
dividends in excess of such thresholds are considered extraordinary and require prior regulatory approval 
during  and  these subsidiaries paid to chubb cash dividends of  million  million and million  respectively 
in  these subsidiaries also paid a dividend of million in other assets 
the maximum dividend distribution that may be made by the property and casualty subsidiaries to chubb during without prior approval is approximately billion 
chubb has a revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that provides for up to million of unsecured borrowings 
there have been no borrowings under this agreement 
various interest rate options are available to chubb  all of which are based on market interest rates 
the agreement contains customary restrictive covenants including a covenant to maintain a minimum consolidated shareholders equity  as adjusted 
at december   chubb was in compliance with all such covenants 
the revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes and to support our commercial paper borrowing arrangement 
the facility had a termination date of june  in october  the agreement was amended to extend the termination date to october  the terms of the amended agreement allow chubb to elect in and again in to extend the termination date of the agreement by an additional year 
on the termination date of the agreement  any borrowings then outstanding become payable

for purposes of the above table  interest after april  was calculated using the three month 
table of contents libor rate as of december  the table includes future interest payments through the scheduled maturity date  april  interest payments for the period from the scheduled maturity date through the final maturity date  march   would increase the contractual obligation by billion 
it is our expectation that the capital securities will be redeemed at the end of the fixed interest rate period 
b there is typically no stated contractual commitment associated with property and casualty insurance loss reserves 
the obligation to pay a claim arises only when a covered loss event occurs and a settlement is reached 
the vast majority of our loss reserves relate to claims for which settlements have not yet been reached 
our loss reserves therefore represent estimates of future payments 
these estimates are dependent on the outcome of claim settlements that will occur over many years 
accordingly  the payment of the loss reserves is not fixed as to either amount or timing 
the estimate of the timing of future payments is based on our historical loss payment patterns 
the ultimate amount and timing of loss payments will likely differ from our estimate and the differences could be material 
we expect that these loss payments will be funded  in large part  by future cash receipts from operations 
the above table excludes certain commitments totaling billion at december  to fund limited partnership investments 
these capital commitments can be called by the partnerships from time to time during the commitment period generally five years or less  if and when needed by the partnerships to fund working capital needs or the purchase of new investments 
it is uncertain whether and  if so  when we will be required to fund these commitments 
there is no predetermined payment schedule

invested assets the main objectives in managing our investment portfolios are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors of chubb and its respective operating companies 
our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of high quality bonds  principally tax exempt  us treasury and government agency  mortgage backed securities and corporate issues as well as foreign government and corporate bonds that support our international operations 
the portfolio also includes equity securities  primarily publicly traded common stocks  and other invested assets  primarily private equity limited partnerships  all of which are held with the primary objective of capital appreciation 
limited partnership investments by their nature are less liquid and involve more risk than other investments 
we actively manage our risk through type of asset class and domestic and international diversification 
at december   we had investments in about separate partnerships 
we review the performance of these investments on a quarterly basis and we obtain audited financial statements annually 
in our us operations  during  we invested new cash in tax exempt bonds and  to a lesser extent  taxable bonds  equity securities and limited partnerships 
the taxable bonds we invested in were corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities while we reduced our holdings of us treasury securities 
in  we invested new cash in tax exempt bonds and  to a lesser extent  equity securities 
table of contents and limited partnerships  whereas we decreased our holdings of taxable bonds  principally us treasury securities 
in  we invested new cash primarily in tax exempt bonds and taxable bonds 
the taxable bonds we invested in were mortgage backed securities and  to a lesser extent  corporate bonds 
our objective is to achieve the appropriate mix of taxable and tax exempt securities in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
at december   of our us fixed maturity portfolio was invested in tax exempt bonds compared with at december  and at december  we classify those fixed maturity securities that may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies  such as in response to changes in interest rates and the yield curve or to maximize after tax returns  as available for sale 
we classify those fixed maturities that we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity as held to maturity 
fixed maturities classified as available for sale are carried at market value while fixed maturities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
only about of the fixed maturity portfolio was classified as held to maturity at december  and during the fourth quarter of  we transferred our remaining held to maturity securities to available for sale 
changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new fixed maturity investments 
while a rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available on new investments  it reduces the market value of existing fixed maturity investments and thus the availability of gains on disposition 
a decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments but increases the market value of existing investments  creating the opportunity for realized investment gains on disposition 
the unrealized appreciation before tax of investments carried at market value  which consists of fixed maturities classified as available for sale and equity securities  was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation is reflected in comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income tax 
changes in unrealized market appreciation or depreciation of fixed maturities were due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates 
change in accounting principles effective december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in the funded status as a component of comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur 
retrospective application is not permitted 
sfas no 
required that any gains or losses and prior service cost that had not yet been included in net benefit costs at the end of the year in which the statement was adopted be recognized as an adjustment of the ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the adoption of sfas no 
reduced shareholders equity at december  by million 
adoption of the statement did not have any effect on the corporation s net income in and and will not in future years 
the adoption of sfas no 
is discussed further in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our primary exposure to market risks relates to our investment portfolio  which is sensitive to changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we also have exposure to market risks through our debt 
table of contents obligations 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
investment portfolio interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a security that promises a fixed return to changes in interest rates 
when market interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income securities decreases 
we view the potential changes in price of our fixed income investments within the overall context of asset and liability management 
our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily our property and casualty loss reserves  to determine their duration  which is the present value of the weighted average payments expressed in years 
we set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the estimated duration of these liabilities and other factors  which we believe mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk for the corporation 
the following table provides information about our fixed maturity investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  and the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts

we have consistently invested in high quality marketable securities 
only about of our bond portfolio is below investment grade 
our investment portfolio does not have any direct exposure to either sub prime mortgages or collateralized debt obligations 
our tax exempt bonds mature on average in nine years  while our taxable bonds have an average maturity of five years 

table of contents about of our tax exempt bonds are rated aa or better by moody s or standard and poor s with about rated aaa 
about of the tax exempt bonds are uninsured and have an average credit rating of aa 
the remaining are insured and are therefore rated aaa 
ongoing credit market related events have weakened the monoline bond insurers and raised concerns about the value of the credit insurance 
the insured tax exempt bonds in our portfolio have been selected based on the quality of the underlying credit and not the value of the credit insurance enhancement
