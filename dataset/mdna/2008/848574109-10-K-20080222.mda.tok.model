recent events boeing b announcement 
on january   the boeing company announced an additional three month schedule shift of the first flight and initial delivery under the b program 
the initial deliveries were rescheduled for early rather than late under our current contractual arrangement with boeing  we will not receive payment for b ship sets delivered to boeing prior to certification and the earlier of boeing s delivery of the aircraft to the customer or the passage of twenty four months from our ship set delivery to boeing 
our original estimate of the impact of this arrangement to working capital  which is calculated as the net of production inventory  engineering costs capitalized into inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable  was million to million between december  and may when the b was originally scheduled for certification and delivery 
with certification and delivery of the b now scheduled for early  we now estimate the impact of the arrangement on working capital to be a maximum of an additional million  which increases the range of working capital impact from the b to between million and billion 
discussions between spirit and boeing regarding our additional working capital requirements resulting from the impact of schedule shifts to spirit s cash flow are continuing 
we are also evaluating alternatives for securing additional financing to meet potential liquidity needs

overview we are the largest independent original parts designer and manufacturer of aerostructures in the world 
aerostructures are structural components  such as fuselages  propulsion systems and wing systems for commercial  military and business jet aircraft 
we derive our revenues primarily through long term supply agreements with boeing and airbus 
for the twelve months ended december   we generated net revenues of  million and net income of million 
we are organized into three principal reporting segments fuselage systems  which include the forward  mid and rear fuselage sections  propulsion systems  which include nacelles  struts pylons and engine structural components and wing systems  which include facilities in tulsa and mcalester  oklahoma and prestwick  scotland that manufacture wings  wing components  flight control surfaces  and other miscellaneous structural parts 
all other activities fall within the all other segment  principally made up of sundry sales of miscellaneous services and sales of natural gas through a tenancy in common with other wichita companies 
fuselage systems  propulsion systems  wing systems and all other represented approximately   and  respectively  of our revenues for the twelve months ended december  market trends the financial health of the commercial airline industry has a direct and significant effect on our commercial aircraft programs 
the commercial airline industry is impacted by the strength of the global economy and geo political events around the world 
in the last two years  both us and foreign air carriers have returned to profitability despite high fuel prices 
healthy increases in global revenue passenger miles rpms have been driven by increasing business and recreational travel demands within the established us and european markets  and continuing deregulation and economic growth stimulating traffic in asia and the middle east 
near term challenges include high fuel prices possibly leading to higher fares  and the continuing turmoil in global credit markets 
table of contents possibly leading to widespread economic slowdown  restricted discretionary spending  and a slowdown in air traffic 
possible exogenous shocks such as expanding conflicts in the middle east  renewed terrorist attacks against the industry  or pandemic health crises have the potential to cause precipitous declines in air traffic 
in  boeing and airbus experienced record aggregate annual airplane orders  followed in with aggregate annual order totals that  at the time  were the second highest ever 
this was followed by a new historical high for aggregate annual airplane orders in as reported by boeing and airbus  the december  combined backlog totaled  commercial aircraft  which grew from a backlog of  as of december  the current backlog represents approximately years of commercial production at delivery rates 
many industry experts believe that annual commercial orders will continue to exceed industry output in  though orders are not expected to approach the record levels of to the extensive backlog has resulted in increased delivery forecasts from both boeing and airbus for the following table sets forth the historical deliveries of boeing and airbus for through  and their announced delivery expectations for boeing airbus total boeing has announced deliveries to be between airbus deliveries of are based on airbus delivery forecasts 
although the commercial aerospace industry is currently experiencing a period of increasing production  our business could be adversely affected by significant changes in the us or global economy 
historically  aircraft travel correlates to economic conditions 
weakening economies can lead to a reduction in airline traffic and resultant decreases in new orders  or even cancellations of existing orders 
part of our strategy during this upturn is to work on diversifying our customer base and reducing our fixed to variable cost ratio so we have downside protection in the cyclical civil aerospace market 
outlook we expect the following results  or ranges of results  for the year ending december  outlook actuals revenues billion billion earnings per share  diluted per share per share effective tax rate our outlook is based on the following market assumptions we expect our revenues to be approximately billion  or higher than revenues 
the revenue projection is based on previously issued boeing and airbus delivery guidance of aircraft and approximately aircraft  respectively 
our revenue guidance for assumes delivery of approximately forty five ship sets from spirit to boeing 
on january   boeing announced an additional three month schedule shift in first flight and first delivery on the program 
presently  we are jointly assessing with boeing the impact of this announcement on our deliveries to them 
a reduction in our ship set deliveries would likely result in lower than forecasted revenues and earnings for the year 
major focus areas for us on the program continue to be solidifying the supply base  accommodating engineering changes  and timely receipt of systems and wiring for installation 
assuming a billion revenue base  earnings per share for are expected to be between and per share as increased volumes on large commercial aircraft programs and improved operating efficiencies increase profitability 
discussions between spirit and boeing concerning schedule shift impacts to our cash flow are continuing 
we expect to provide cash flow guidance upon completion of these discussions 
we are also

effective december   the us research tax credit expired 
while there has been activity to retroactively extend the research credit  a bill has not been signed into law 
if a retroactive extension of the credit is not signed into law  there could be an unfavorable impact on our effective income tax rate 
the impact of the us research tax credit reduced the effective income tax rate by the boeing acquisition and related transactions in december and february  an investor group led by onex partners lp and onex corporation formed the companies of spirit and spirit holdings  respectively  for the purpose of acquiring boeing wichita 
on june   spirit acquired boeing wichita for a cash purchase price of approximately million and the assumption of certain liabilities  pursuant to the asset purchase agreement 
based on final working capital and other factors specified in the asset purchase agreement  a purchase price adjustment of million was paid to spirit in the fourth quarter of the acquisition was financed through borrowings of a million term loan b under our senior secured credit facilities and an equity investment of million 
proceeds from the term loan b were used to consummate the boeing acquisition and pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith and for working capital 
our senior secured credit facilities also included a million revolving credit facility which has since been increased to million  none of which was borrowed at the closing date of the boeing acquisition and million of which is outstanding in the form of letters of credit which has since increased to million 
in connection with the boeing acquisition  boeing is required to make payments to spirit in amounts of million in all of which was paid  million in and million in  in payment for various tooling and capital assets built or purchased by spirit 
these amounts are included at their net present value within current and non current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
spirit will retain unimpeded usage rights and custody of these assets for their remaining useful lives without compensation to boeing 
boeing also contributed million to us to partially offset our costs to transition to a stand alone company 
the fair value of the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined by management based on valuations performed by an independent third party 
the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the total consideration for the acquisition by approximately million 
the excess negative goodwill was allocated on a pro rata basis to long lived assets 
in connection with the boeing acquisition  we entered into a long term supply agreement under which we are boeing s exclusive supplier for substantially all of the products and services that boeing wichita provided to boeing prior to the boeing acquisition 
the supply contract is a requirements contract covering certain products such as fuselages  struts  wing components and nacelles for boeing b  b  b and b commercial aircraft programs for the life of these programs  including any commercial derivative models 
pricing for existing products is contractually set through may  with average prices decreasing at higher volume levels and increasing at lower volume levels 
we also entered into a long term supply agreement for boeing s new b platform covering the life of this platform  including commercial derivatives 
under this contract  we will be boeing s exclusive supplier for the forward fuselage  fixed and moveable leading wing edges and engine pylons for the b pricing for the initial configuration of the b model is generally set through  with prices decreasing as cumulative production volume levels are achieved 
prices are subject to adjustment for abnormal inflation above a specified level in any year and for certain production  schedule and other specific changes  including design changes from the contract configuration baseline 
we are currently in negotiations with boeing on pricing for certain changes 
the parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith the prices for future commercial derivatives  such as the b and the b  based on principles consistent with the b supply agreement terms as they relate to the b model 
union equity participation plan compensation expense pursuant to our union equity participation plan uep we were obligated to pay benefits tied to the value of our class b common stock for the benefit of certain employees represented by the iam  ibew and uaw upon the consummation of our initial public offering 
the benefits were to be paid  at our option  in the form of cash and or future issuance of shares of our class a common stock  valued at the initial public offering price 
the company 
table of contents expensed million and million related to the union equity participation plan for the year ended december  and the quarter ended march   respectively 
we paid approximately of the total benefit in shares of class a common stock  through the issuance of  shares in march the portion of the benefit that was paid in stock was accounted for as an equity based plan under sfas r  statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment 
this treatment resulted in a million increase and a million decrease to additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and march   respectively 
the decrease as of march   resulted from the payment of cash in lieu of shares to employees whose employment terminated prior to march  the remainder of the benefit was paid in cash using million of the proceeds of the initial public offering and million from available cash 
basis of presentation since the boeing acquisition was effective on june   the financial statements and subsidiary detail for prior periods relate to our predecessor  the wichita division of boeing commercial airplanes bca  which we refer to as boeing wichita or the predecessor  and are presented on a carve out basis 
as a result  we believe that the financial statements for the predecessor are not comparable to the financial statements for spirit holdings for periods following the boeing acquisition  as described under the heading pre boeing acquisition results are not comparable to post boeing acquisition results 
prior to the boeing acquisition 
prior to the completion of the boeing acquisition  the predecessor was a division of boeing and was not a separate legal entity 
historically  the predecessor functioned as an internal supplier of parts and assemblies to boeing aircraft programs and had very few sales to third parties 
it operated as a cost center within boeing  meaning that it recognized its cost of products manufactured for bca programs  but did not recognize any corresponding revenues for those products 
no intra company pricing was established for the parts and assemblies that the predecessor supplied to boeing 
revenues from sales to third parties were insignificant  consisting of less than  in each of and  and in the period from january  through the closing date of the boeing acquisition 
as a cost center  the division operated under intra company arrangements with boeing  with all transactions with boeing conducted on a non cash basis 
the predecessor accumulated incurred costs and assigned a per finished item value to the airplane programs as completed items were delivered to boeing s puget sound facilities for final assembly 
certain amounts included in the predecessor s financial statements have been allocated from bca and or boeing 
spirit believes that these allocations are reasonable  but not necessarily indicative of costs that would have been incurred by boeing wichita had it operated as a stand alone business for the same periods 
statements of cash flows have not been presented for the predecessor because it did not maintain cash accounts and participated in boeing s centralized cash management systems with boeing funding all of its cash requirements 
the predecessor s financial statements include both the wichita and tulsa mcalester sites 
all intercompany balances and transactions involving the consolidating entities have been eliminated in consolidation 
post boeing acquisition 
since the boeing acquisition  spirit has operated as a stand alone entity with its own accounting records 
the consolidated financial statements for the period from june  through december  and the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and december   include spirit holdings  spirit and its other subsidiaries in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
 sfas no 
and financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
r 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory  income taxes  financing obligations  warranties  
table of contents pensions and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
however  the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods  assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following are our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require management s most subjective and complex judgments  requiring the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
revenues and profit recognition a significant portion of spirit s revenues are recognized under long term  volume based pricing contracts  requiring delivery of products over several years 
spirit recognizes revenue under the contract method of accounting and records sales and profits on each contract in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting  using the units of delivery method 
we follow the requirements of statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts the contract method of accounting  using the cumulative catch up method in accounting for revisions in estimates 
under the cumulative catch up method  the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized immediately when changes in estimated contract profitability become known 
a profit rate is estimated based on the difference between total revenues and total costs of a contract 
total revenues at any given time include actual historical revenues up to that time plus future estimated revenues 
total costs at any given time include actual historical costs up to that time plus future estimated costs 
estimated revenues include negotiated or expected values for units delivered  estimates of probable recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications  price adjustments for contract and volume changes  and escalation 
costs include the estimated cost of certain pre production effort including non recurring engineering and planning subsequent to completion of final design plus the estimated cost of manufacturing a specified number of production units 
estimates take into account assumptions relative to future labor performance and rates  and projections relative to material and overhead costs including expected learning curve cost reductions over the term of the contract 
the specified number of production units used to establish the profit margin contract block is predicated upon contractual terms and market forecasts 
the assumed timeframe period covered by the contract block is generally equal to the period specified in the contract or the future timeframe for which we can project reasonably dependable cost estimates 
if the contract is a life of program contract  then the life of the contract block is usually the latter of these timeframes 
estimated revenues and costs also take into account the expected impact of specific contingencies that we believe are probable 
estimates of revenues and costs for our contracts span a period of multiple years and are based on a substantial number of underlying assumptions 
we believe that the underlying assumptions are sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable estimate of the profit to be generated 
however  due to the significant length of time over which revenue streams will be generated  the variability of the revenue and cost streams can be significant if the assumptions change 
for revenues not recognized under the contract method of accounting  we recognize revenues from the sale of products at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
revenues earned from providing maintenance service are recognized when the service is complete 
revenues from non recurring design work are recognized based on substantive milestones that are indicative of our progress toward completion 
for hardware end items  the predecessor recognized transferred costs when the item was due on dock at boeing s major assembly facility 
costs of products manufactured at the predecessor s wichita site were valued at discrete unit cost  while costs of products manufactured at its tulsa mcalester facility were valued based on the estimated average cost for a boeing defined block of units 
the cost of other work services  tooling  etc 
was measured at actual cost as the costs were incurred by the predecessor 

table of contents we treat the boeing owned tooling that we use in the performance of our supply agreements with boeing as having been obtained in the boeing acquisition pursuant to the equivalent of a capital lease and we take a charge against revenues for the amortization of such tooling in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting in a business combination for deferred revenue of an acquiree and eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
inventory raw materials are stated at the lower of cost on an actual or average cost basis or market which is consistent with the predecessor s valuation of raw materials 
inventory costs relating to long term contracts are stated at the actual production costs  including manufacturing and engineering overhead incurred to date  reduced by amounts associated with revenues recognized on units delivered 
inventory costs on long term contracts include certain pre production costs incurred once research and development activity has ended and the product is ready for manufacture  including applicable overhead  in accordance with sop in addition  inventory costs typically include higher learning curve costs on new programs 
these factors usually result in an increase in inventory referred to as excess over average or deferred production costs during the early years of a contract 
these costs are deferred only to the extent the amount of actual or expected excess over average is reasonably expected to be fully offset by lower than average costs in future periods of a contract 
if we determine that in process inventory plus estimated costs to complete a specific contract exceeds the anticipated remaining sales value of such contract  such excess is charged to cost of sales in the period in which such determination is made  thus reducing inventory to estimated realizable value 
finished goods inventory is stated at its estimated average per unit cost based on all units expected to be produced 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that in management s opinion will ultimately be realized 
the effect of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period during which the rate change occurs 
we record an income tax expense or benefit based on the net income earned or net loss incurred in each tax jurisdiction and the tax rate applicable to that income or loss 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
these uncertainties are accounted for in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the final tax outcome for these matters may be different than management s original estimates made in determining the income tax provision 
a change to these estimates could impact the effective tax rate and net income or loss in subsequent periods 
we use the flow through accounting method for investment tax credits 
under this method  investment tax credits reduce income tax expense 
no income taxes were identified or allocated to the predecessor 
all income taxes were recorded at the boeing corporate level 
pensions and other post retirement benefits we account for pensions and other post retirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  both as modified by sfas r  employers disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits as amended and sfas sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans 
the financial accounting standards board issued and we adopted sfas during  which requires companies to reflect the funded status for each of their defined benefit and post retirement plans on 
table of contents the balance sheet 
in and we used november as our measurement date 
beginning in  we are required to use december as our measurement date 
assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the annual expense for our pension and post retirement benefits other than pensions are evaluated and established in conjunction with an independent actuary 
we set the discount rate assumption annually for each of our retirement related benefit plans as of the measurement date  based on a review of projected cash flows and long term high quality corporate bond yield curves 
the discount rate determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the benefit obligation as of that date  and is also used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense income for the upcoming plan year 
we derive assumed expected rate of return on pension assets from the long term expected returns based on the investment allocation by class specified in our investment policy 
the expected return on plan assets determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense income for the upcoming plan year 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the post retirement health care plans 
to determine the health care cost trend rates  we consider national health trends and adjust for our specific plan designs and locations 
the predecessor participated in various pension and post retirement plans sponsored by boeing which covered substantially all of its employees 
the costs of such plans were not discretely identifiable to the predecessor  but were allocated by boeing to the predecessor and included in the cost of products transferred 
the assets and obligations under these plans were also not discretely identified to the predecessor 
stock compensation plans at inception  we adopted sfas no 
r  which generally requires companies to measure the cost of employee and non employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value and to recognize this cost over the requisite service period or immediately if there is no service period or other performance requirements 
stock based compensation represents a significant accounting policy of ours which is further described in note within the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we have established various stock compensation plans which include restricted share grants and stock purchase plans 
purchase accounting boeing acquisition 
we have accounted for the boeing acquisition as a purchase in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair value of the consideration paid  which is summarized in the following table 
dollars in millions cash payment to boeing direct costs of the acquisition less consideration to be returned from boeing for sale of capital assets consideration to be returned from boeing for transition costs working capital settlement total consideration direct costs of the acquisition include professional fees paid to outside advisors for investment banking  legal  tax  due diligence  appraisal and valuation services 
in connection with the boeing acquisition  boeing agreed to make non interest bearing payments to spirit in amounts of million in all of which was paid  million in and million in  in payment for various tooling and capital assets built or purchased by spirit 
spirit will retain usage rights and custody of the assets for their remaining useful lives without compensation to boeing 
since spirit retains the risks and rewards of ownership 
table of contents to such assets  spirit recorded such amounts as consideration to be returned from boeing at a net present value of approximately million 
the initial amount accretes as interest income until payments occur and are recorded as a component of other assets 
the accretion of interest income was approximately million  million and million in the twelve months of  and in fiscal  respectively 
in connection with the boeing acquisition  boeing also made payments to spirit totaling million through june for spirit s costs of transition to a newly formed enterprise 
since spirit had no obligations under this arrangement  such amounts were recorded as consideration to be returned from boeing 
these payments were not discounted as they were realized within one year of closing 
in accordance with the asset purchase agreement  in fiscal  boeing reimbursed spirit approximately million for the contractually determined working capital settlement 
the fair value of the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined by management 
the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the total consideration for the acquisition by approximately million 
the excess negative goodwill was allocated on a pro rata basis to long lived assets and resulted in the purchase price allocation as follows book value june  dollars in millions cash accounts receivable inventory other current assets property  plant and equipment intangible assets other assets pension asset accounts payable and accrued liabilities pension and post retirement liabilities net assets acquired bae acquisition 
we accounted for the bae acquisition as a purchase in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the fair value of the consideration paid  which is summarized in the following table dollars in millions cash payment to bae systems direct costs of the acquisition working capital settlement total consideration 
table of contents the fair value of the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed was determined by management based on valuations performed by an independent third party 
the total consideration exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by approximately million  resulting in goodwill 
the purchase price was allocated as follows book value april  dollars in millions cash accounts receivable inventory other current assets property  plant and equipment intangible assets goodwill currency hedge assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities pension liabilities other liabilities currency hedge liabilities net assets acquired new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which is an interpretation of fasb statement  accounting for income taxes 
interpretation no 
 effective for fiscal years beginning after december   requires management to perform a two step evaluation for all tax positions  ensuring that these tax return positions meet the more likely than not recognition threshold and can be measured with sufficient precision to determine the benefit recognized in the financial statements 
this interpretation provides management with a comprehensive model for how the company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on its income tax returns 
we adopted the provisions of interpretation no 
on january  previously  we had accounted for tax contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in accordance with interpretation no 
 the company recognizes the financial statement impact of a tax position only after determining that  based on its technical merits  the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position upon audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
at the adoption date and for the year ended december   interpretation no 
has been applied to all tax positions as the statute of limitations has not expired for any of the company s tax years 
as a result of the implementation of interpretation no 
 the company did not incur any change in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measures 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption encouraged 
the provisions of sfas are to be applied on a prospective basis  with the exception of certain financial instruments for which retrospective application is required 
on november   the fasb granted a one year deferral for non financial assets and liabilities to comply with sfas the rule s scheduled effective date for financial assets  november  remains intact 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to materially affect our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which allows for the option to measure financial instruments  warranties  and insurance contracts at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of sfas we do not presently have any financial assets or liabilities that we would elect to measure at fair value 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree  and any goodwill acquired to be measured at their fair value at the acquisition date 
the statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations completed subsequent to that adoption 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained non controlling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
the statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non controlling owners 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the application of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
accounting changes and pronouncements following the boeing acquisition  we adopted a number of accounting policies  practices and conventions that differ from the predecessor  including but not limited to the following change from discrete unit or block costing to the use of long term contract accounting  reclassification of certain costs from cost of sales to selling  general and administrative costs  or sg a  change from accelerated depreciation methods for most personal property to straight line depreciation methods for all property  plant and equipment  implementation of accounting for new activities that were not performed by or otherwise recognized by the predecessor  and establishment of a lower dollar threshold for capitalization of internal use software 
other than the above changes associated with the transition of boeing wichita to a stand alone business  there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the periods presented 
results of operations a ship set is a full set of components produced by us for one airplane  and may include fuselage components  wing systems and propulsion systems 
for purposes of measuring production or deliveries for boeing aircraft in a given period  the term ship set refers to sets of structural fuselage components produced or delivered in such period 
for purposes of measuring production or deliveries for airbus aircraft in a given period  the term ship set refers to sets of wing components produced or delivered in such period 
other components which are part of the same aircraft ship sets could be produced or shipped in earlier or later accounting periods than the components used to measure production or deliveries  which may result in slight variations in production or delivery quantities of the various ship set components in any given period 
the predecessor s results were driven primarily by boeing s commercial airplane demand and the resulting production volume 

table of contents for the twelve months ended december   combined deliveries by spirit and the predecessor were ship sets 
as a stand alone company  including spirit europe deliveries  spirit delivered ship sets in the twelve months ended december  which includes nine months of spirit europe and ship sets in the twelve months ended december   an increase of ship sets over the prior year 
deliveries for the b increased from ship sets in to in and in deliveries for the b increased from ship sets delivered in to in and in b and b production remained at comparatively low levels during fiscal periods and  but the b did see a modest increase in in the twelve months ended december   we delivered test units fatigue and static and production unit for the b period costs include expenses such as sg a and research and development that are charged directly to expense and not capitalized in inventory as a cost of production 
our higher period costs for the post boeing acquisition periods reflect new functions required to establish a stand alone business  accounting reclassifications and nonrecurring transition costs of million in  million in and million in the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain of our operating data spirit holdings predecessor period period from from twelve twelve june  january  months months ended ended through through december  december  december  june  dollars in millions net revenues    n a cost of sales a selling  general and administrative expenses b research and development operating income loss n a interest expense and financing fee amortization n a interest income other income  net n a provision for benefit from income taxes n a net income loss n a a included in cost of sales are charges related to the uep payout of million

the favorable cumulative catch up in was driven by decreases in fringe and pension expenses and opening balance sheet adjustments  which resulted in lower depreciation expense 
excluding these factors  cost of sales increased  comparable to the increase in sales  primarily attributable to the increase in ship set deliveries and the full year impact of spirit europe 
sg a  research and development and other period costs 
sg a  research and development and other period costs as a percentage of net revenues for the twelve months ended december  was compared to for the same period in the prior year 
sg a expenses for the twelve months ended december   were lower as a percentage of net revenues due to an increase in net revenues and a reduction in spending on transition related costs and lower stock compensation expenses 
sg a in also included million of non cash stock compensation expense related to the secondary offering that occurred in may of and expenses of million associated with the evaluation of airbus manufacturing sites in europe 
transition expenses were reduced from million in to million in as the transition to spirit owned systems and processes progressed 
in  we recognized million in stock compensation expense as compared to million in research and development costs for were million as compared to million in the lower r d expenses can be attributed to the completion of r d spending on the program 
operating income 
operating income for the twelve months ended december   was million  compared to an operating loss of million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase is primarily related to the fact that operating income for included million of expense related to the secondary offering and evaluation of airbus european manufacturing sites as compared to million in ipo related expense in additional factors driving the increase include the additional gross profit from greater sales volume  improvements to cost of sales  lower sg a expenses  particularly transition and stock compensation expenses  and lower r d expenses  primarily associated with the completion of r d spending on the program

interest expense and financing fee amortization for the twelve months ended december   includes million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long term debt and million in amortization of deferred financing costs as compared to million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long term debt and million in amortization of deferred financing costs in the prior year 
also included in are expenses related to our public offering of million 
the decrease in of million as compared to the twelve months ended december   was primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from the million prepayment of debt and the write off of the related deferred financing costs in the fourth quarter of interest income 
interest income was million for each of the twelve month periods ended december   and december  interest income included the accretion of the discounted long term receivable from boeing for capital expense reimbursement pursuant to the asset purchase agreement for the boeing acquisition 
provision for income taxes 
our reported tax rate includes two principal components an expected annual tax rate and discrete items resulting in additional provisions or benefits that are recorded in the quarter that an event 
table of contents arises 
events or items that give rise to discrete recognition could include finalizing audit examinations for open tax years  a statute of limitation s expiration  or a stock acquisition 
the income tax provision for the twelve months ended december   was million compared to a tax benefit in of million 
the change is related primarily to the reversal of a non recurring valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in and additional state income tax credits recorded this year 
the effective tax rate was 
this is lower than the us statutory tax rate primarily due to state tax credits  the federal research and development tax credit  and a qualified domestic production activities deduction

net revenues for the twelve months ended december  cannot be compared to net revenues for the ten and one half months ended december   as contains twelve months of operations compared to six and one half months of operations for the comparable period of due to the fact that the operations of spirit as a standalone entity did not commence until june  the amounts also include the results of spirit europe beginning april   the date we acquired spirit europe

included in sg a expenses are a fourth quarter charge of million related to the termination of the intercompany agreement with onex and a charge of million related to the executive incentive plan 
this reduction in percentage of net revenues between periods was driven by decreasing transition expenses as we neared completion of the transition from boeing to spirit and decreasing research and development spending on the b program as production commenced 
this decrease was also partially attributable to the stock compensation charge incurred in 
table of contents related to the revision of fair values assigned to stock purchases and grants made in that year 
this caused stock compensation expense to increase to million in the period 
fiscal year stock compensation expense included in sg a was million

provision for income taxes 
we established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets created from inception through september  this allowance was recorded because there was no earnings history for spirit holdings nor any other positive and negative evidence that would have collectively determined whether we were able to realize these assets 
the valuation allowance increased our tax provision by deferring the tax benefits until such time that we determined under sfas no 
that we had sufficient earnings history to recognize those benefits 
we review the need for a valuation allowance each quarter 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that a sufficient earnings history was established to release the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance reversal in the year ended december   resulted in a million decrease to non current intangibles  a million federal income tax benefit and a state income tax benefit

period from january  through june  for the reasons discussed above  the predecessor s historical financial statements for the periods prior to the boeing acquisition are not comparable to spirit holdings financial statements for periods subsequent to the boeing acquisition  so a comparison of financial results for the period from january  through june  with those of any subsequent period would not be meaningful 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity  or access to cash  is an important factor in determining our financial stability 
the primary sources of our liquidity include cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity through our credit facilities and advance payments and receivables from customers 
our liquidity requirements and working capital needs depend on a number of factors  including delivery rates and payment terms under our contracts  the level of research and development expenditures related to new programs  capital expenditures  growth and contractions in the business cycle  contributions to our union sponsored plans and interest and debt payments 
we expect that our working capital requirements will increase significantly through early as the b program progresses toward faa certification and we build inventory in support of the program 
under our current arrangement with boeing  payment for ship sets delivered to boeing prior to faa certification will be made after faa certification and upon the earlier of boeing delivering the aircraft to its customer or the passage of twenty four months from our ship set delivery to boeing 
payment for ship set deliveries made to boeing after faa certification will be made on standard commercial terms 
our original estimates of the impact of this arrangement to working capital  which is calculated as the net of production inventory  engineering costs capitalized into inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable  were million to million between december  and may when the b was originally scheduled for certification and delivery 
currently  boeing expects to certify and deliver the b in early we now estimate the impact of the arrangement on working capital to be a maximum of an additional million  which increases the range of working capital impact from the b to between million and billion 
discussions between spirit and boeing concerning the impact of schedule shifts to spirit s cash flow are continuing 
the company is also evaluating alternatives for securing additional financing to meet potential liquidity needs 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  or to pay the interest on  or to refinance  our indebtedness  or to fund non acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this is subject  in part  to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current levels of operations and absent any disruptive events  management believes that internally generated funds  advance payments  and receivables from customers  and borrowings available under our revolving loan facility should provide sufficient resources to finance our operations  non acquisition related capital expenditures  research and development efforts and long term indebtedness obligations through at least fiscal year we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowing will be available to us under our credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
also  to the extent we accelerate our growth plans  consummate acquisitions or have lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses  we may also need to raise additional capital 
in particular  increased working capital needs occur whenever we consummate acquisitions or experience strong incremental 
table of contents demand for our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions on an opportunistic basis 
our acquisition strategy may require substantial capital  and we may not be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all 
if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions  our total interest expense will increase 
pursuant to our union equity participation plan we were obligated to pay benefits tied to the value of our class b common stock for the benefit of certain employees represented by the iam  the ibew  and uaw  upon the consummation of our initial public offering 
the benefits were to be paid  at our option  in the form of cash and or future issuance of shares of our class a common stock  valued at the initial public offering price 
we expensed million and million related to the union equity participation plan for the year ended december  and the quarter ended march   respectively 
we paid approximately of the total benefit in shares of class a common stock  through the issuance of  shares in march the portion of the benefit that was paid in stock was accounted for as an equity based plan under sfas r 
this treatment resulted in a million increase and a million decrease to additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and march   respectively 
the remainder of the benefit was paid in cash using million of the proceeds of the initial public offering and million from available cash 
we currently have manufacturing capacity to produce ship sets at the rates we have committed to our customers 
we have additional capacity on some of our products  but our capacity utilization on the fuselages for the b and b are at close to at our current production rates 
these capacity utilization rates are based on five days per week  three shifts per day operations 
significant capital expenditures may be required if our customers request that we increase production rates for an extended period of time 
our supply agreements typically have maximum production rates 
if a customer requests that we increase production rates above these stated maximum levels  additional negotiation would be required to determine whether we or our customer would bear the cost of any capital expenditures  tooling and nonrecurring engineering required as a result of such production rate increases 
our corporate credit rating at standard poor s rating services and moody s investor service as of december  was bb and ba  respectively 
on january   standard poor s revised the company s credit outlook from positive to negative reflecting the potential for materially reduced cash flow as a result of boeing schedule shifts and the potential impact on working capital 
standard poor s did not revise our bb rating 
moody s outlook for spirit remains unchanged since december  cash 
at december  and december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
we maintain bank accounts with highly rated financial institutions and from time to time we invest excess cash in a liquid  short term money market fund 
to date  our cash investments have had no direct exposure to any sub prime asset classes 
on april   we used approximately million of cash to pay the purchase price for the bae acquisition 
credit facilities 
in connection with the boeing acquisition  spirit and certain of its affiliates entered into million of senior secured credit facilities with citicorp north america  inc and a syndicate of other lenders  consisting of a six and one half year million term loan b and a five year million revolver 
the term loan b was used to pay a portion of the consideration for the boeing acquisition and certain fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith 
we repaid million of principal of the term loan b at the time of our initial public offering and entered into an amendment and restatement of the senior secured credit facilities at that time which  among other things  extended the maturity of the term loan b by twenty one months and increased the revolver from million to million 
the term loan b is repayable in quarterly installments of of the aggregate principal amount thereof through september  with the remaining balance due in the final four quarters 
the revolver is available for general corporate purposes of spirit and its subsidiaries  and contains a letter of credit sub facility 
as of december   approximately million was outstanding under the term loan b  no amounts were outstanding under the revolver and million of letters of credit were outstanding 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of libor plus the applicable margin as defined below or  at our option  the alternate base rate  which will be the highest of the 
table of contents citicorp north america  inc prime rate  the certificate of deposit rate  plus and the federal funds rate plus  plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin with respect to the term loan b is per annum in the case of such portion of the term loan b that bears interest at libor and in the case of such portion of the term loan b that bears interest at the alternate base rate 
the applicable margin with respect to borrowings under the revolver is determined in accordance with a performance grid based on our total leverage ratio and ranges from to per annum in the case of libor advances and from to per annum in the case of alternate base rate advances 
we are also obligated to pay a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the revolver 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks 
the obligations under the senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by spirit holdings  and each of spirit s direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries other than non wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that are prohibited from providing such guarantees 
all obligations under the senior secured credit facilities and the guarantees are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of spirit s and the guarantor s assets 
the senior secured credit facilities contain customary affirmative and negative covenants  including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens on our assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  make investments  pay dividends  redeem stock and engage in mergers  consolidations and sales of assets 
the senior secured credit facilities also contain a financial covenant consisting of a maximum senior credit facility leverage ratio 
we were in compliance with this covenant as of december  investment in b program 
we have received cash from boeing to fund development in connection with the b program  for capital expenditures in connection with our other boeing production work and for stand alone transition costs 
we expect to invest approximately billion  excluding capitalized interest  on the b program for research and development  capitalized pre production costs and capitalized expenditures including tooling  of which approximately million  excluding capitalized interest  had been spent as of december  the b supply agreement required boeing to make advance payments to us for production articles in the aggregate amount of million  all of which had been received by us as of december  we must repay these advances  without interest  in the amount of a million offset against the purchase price of each of the first five hundred b ship sets delivered to boeing 
in the event that boeing does not take delivery of five hundred b ship sets  any advances not then repaid will first be applied against any outstanding b payments then due by boeing to us  with any remaining balance repaid at the rate of million per year beginning the month following our final delivery of a b production ship set to boeing 
receivables from boeing 
in connection with the boeing acquisition  boeing agreed to make non interest bearing payments to spirit in amounts of million in all of which was paid  million in and million in  in payment for various tooling and capital assets built or purchased by spirit 
spirit will retain usage rights and custody of the assets for their remaining useful lives without compensation to boeing 
boeing also contributed million  which was received by us in three installments in and  to partially offset our costs to transition to a stand alone company 
tax incentive bonds 
both spirit and the predecessor utilized city of wichita issued industrial revenue bonds irbs to finance self constructed and purchased real and personal property at the wichita site 
tax benefits associated with irbs include provisions for a ten year complete property tax abatement and kansas department of revenue sales tax exemption on all irb funded purchases 
spirit and the predecessor purchased these irbs so they are both bondholders and debtor lessee for the property purchased with the irb proceeds 
therefore  spirit and the predecessor may offset the amounts invested and obligations for these bonds on a consolidated basis 
the city of wichita owns the irb funded property and leases it to spirit with respect to the bonds issued in december and december and to the predecessor with respect to the bonds issued in december through december title to the leased property reverts to the lessee when the bonds are redeemed or mature 
the bonds issued in and mature ten years from issuance while the bonds issued in through mature years after their issuance 
certain predecessor property that was subject to predecessor owned irbs continues to be subject to those irbs 
in connection with the boeing acquisition  the predecessor assigned its leasehold interest in irb funded 
table of contents assets and the related bonds to a special purpose trust beneficially owned by boeing which subleases these assets to spirit 
pursuant to the sublease terms  the special purpose trust will purchase the assets from the city of wichita  terminate the leases between the city and predecessor  redeem the bonds  and transfer the assets to spirit when these assets cease to qualify for the ten year property tax abatement 
the face value for the bonds subleased from the special purpose trust is approximately million 
in addition  spirit obtained irbs in and with an aggregate principal amount of million 
in conjunction with tooling sales to boeing  spirit redeemed million of irbs issued in and million of irbs issued in in march and october  respectively 
we entered into an incentive agreement with the kansas department of commerce  pursuant to which the kansas development finance authority issued bonds and provided loans to finance eligible projects 
the program s purpose is to provide us with incentives to invest in the state of kansas 
to induce this investment  the kansas department of revenue will rebate certain payroll taxes until the bonds are redeemed or mature 
pursuant to offset provisions in the underlying debt instruments  there are no principal or interest cash payments associated with the bonds 
as debtor  spirit offsets the amount owed to its wholly owned subsidiary  spirit aerosystems finance  inc  as bondholder 
therefore  we may offset the amounts invested and obligations for these bonds on a consolidated basis 
the debt instruments total million and will expire in december open infrastructure offering oio 
on september   we entered into a five year agreement with international business machines corporation  or ibm  and ibm credit  llc  or ibm credit 
this agreement includes the financing of the purchase of software licenses with a value of million payable in monthly payments of million for months with an interest rate of 
on july  this initial loan was refinanced 
this refinancing agreement increased the monthly payment from to million and reduced the number of payments by months 
during the third quarter of additional software was purchased totaling million and was financed with ibm credit 
these additional loans have a combined monthly payment of million and are for terms of and months with effective interest rates of and  respectively 
under the terms of the oio agreement  we would be in default if our credit rating with standard poor s for secured debt falls below bb 
our debt rating as of the date of this annual report was bb 
in the event that ibm or ibm credit determines that we are in default under the oio agreement  we would be required to pay ibm any previously unpaid monthly payments under the agreement and pay ibm credit a settlement charge 
additionally  if we do not make the required payments to ibm or ibm credit  as applicable  we could be required to cease using and surrender all licensed program materials financed by ibm credit and destroy our copies of such program materials 
ibm has a security interest in any equipment acquired through the lease agreement included in the oio 
as of december   we had debt related to the oio agreement of million 
other debt 
in addition to the oio agreement with ibm we entered into an agreement on march  to finance a service contract with ibm for assisting us in implementing our operating systems 
this contract has a total value of million 
the agreement is to make monthly draws against the contract as the work is performed and certain milestones are achieved 
each draw is a separate loan with twenty four equal payments paid monthly  and carries an interest rate of 
as of december  we have drawn a total of million and have paid back million resulting in a balance of approximately million 
cash flow twelve months ended december  operating activities 
spirit had a net cash inflow of million related to operations in the twelve months ended december  this was primarily due to earnings  excluding non cash items  of million and million of customer advances and deferred revenue payments partially offset by inventory build up for the start up of the b program and other new programs 
customer advances were significantly less in than in prior years because the payment schedule for the b advances from boeing provided for lower payments in investing activities 
spirit had a net cash outflow of million related to investing activities in the twelve months ended december  this was primarily due to investments of million in property  
table of contents plant and equipment  software and program tooling 
the primary capital expenditures included investment in our facilities and development of our stand alone computer systems 
financing activities 
spirit had a net cash inflow of million related to financing activities in the twelve months ended december  this was due primarily to million related to excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements which are reflected as outflows in operating activities partially offset by million of payments on long term debt 
twelve months ended december  operating activities 
spirit had a net cash inflow of million related to operations in the twelve months ended december  this was primarily due to receipt of a million advance payment from boeing on the b program  earnings of million  excluding non cash items  a million increase in accounts payable primarily as a result of increases in inventory resulting from higher production rates  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  and million in inventory growth as a result of higher production rates and build up of inventory for the b contract 
investing activities 
spirit had a net cash outflow of million related to investing activities in the twelve months ended december  this was primarily due to investments of million in property  plant and equipment  software and program tooling  most of which was related to capital investments in preparation of the start of b production 
we also invested million in the acquisition of bae systems aerostructures business net of cash acquired 
financing activities 
spirit had a net cash inflow of million related to financing activities in the twelve months ended december  this was primarily due to million in proceeds from our initial public offering and million related to tax benefits from shared based payment arrangements  partially offset by million in long term debt payments 
period from june  through december  operating activities 
spirit had a net cash inflow related to operating activities of million in the six and one half months ended december  this was primarily due to the receipt of million in advance payments from boeing related to the b program  an increase of million in accounts payable driven by a combination of increased production rates and higher research and development expenses  offset by the operating loss  an increase of million in accounts receivable and an increase of million in inventory 
the increase in accounts receivable was a result of spirit commencing external sales under contractual payment terms 
the increase in inventory reflects unbilled product development activity on certain boeing derivative models and the residual impact of lower production rates during the boeing strike 
investing activities 
in the six and one half months ended december   we had a net cash outflow of  million related to investing activities 
this reflects a cash payment of million paid in connection with the boeing acquisition and investment of million in property  plant and equipment  software and program tooling 
the investment in property  plant and equipment was primarily related to capital investments in preparation of the start of b production 
financing activities 
we had a net cash inflow from financing activities of  million in the six and one half months ended december  this cash flow was primarily driven by the issuance of million of long term debt in connection with the boeing acquisition and the equity investment of million in connection with the boeing acquisition 
period from january  through june  the predecessor s cash was provided by and managed at the boeing corporate level and  consequently  the predecessor had no separate cash balance 
while certain cash flow information is included in a note to the predecessor s historical financial statements  such information is estimated using a change in net working capital approach 
the predecessor did not have any significant cash inflows  and therefore the predecessor s cash flows are not comparable to spirit s cash flows as a stand alone entity following the boeing acquisition 
the predecessor s 
table of contents cash flows from operating activities are largely based on cost of products transferred and period costs and the predecessor s cash flows from investing activities are equivalent to capital expenditures

purchase obligations represent computing  tooling costs  and property  plant and equipment commitments at december  although we also have significant other purchase obligations  most commonly in the form of purchase orders  the timing of these purchases is often variable rather than specific and the payments made by our customers in accordance with our long term contracts  including advance payments  substantially reimburse the payments due 
accordingly  these obligations are not included in the table 
a transition services agreement  or tsa  with boeing is excluded from contractual obligations shown above because it may be terminated by spirit with days advance notice 
the tsa covers services to be supplied by boeing to spirit during the company s continuing transition that is scheduled to be completed in the services supplied by boeing include computer systems and services  certain financial transaction processing operations  and certain non production operations 
spirit pays boeing approximately million per month for the remaining services under the tsa 
our primary future cash needs will consist of working capital  debt service  research and development and capital expenditures 
we expend significant capital on research and development during the start up phase of new programs  to develop new technologies for next generation aircraft and to improve the manufacturing processes of aircraft already in production 
research and development expenditures totaled approximately million and million for the twelve months ended december  and december   respectively  and approximately million for the ten and one half months ended december  we incur capital expenditures for the purpose of maintaining production capacity through replacement of existing equipment and facilities and  from time to time  for facility expansion 
capital expenditures totaled approximately million and million for the twelve months ended december  and december   respectively  and approximately million for the ten and one half months ended december  the research and development and capital expenditures are primarily attributable to spending on the b program 
we may from time to time seek to retire our outstanding debt 
the amounts involved may be material 
in addition  we may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to do so and contractual restrictions permit us 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases disclosed in the notes to spirit holdings financial statements included in this annual report  we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  tax we establish reserves to provide for additional income taxes that may be due in future years as these previously filed tax returns are audited in accordance with fin we recognize the financial statement impact for tax positions only after determining that based on its technical merits the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position on audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the reserves are adjusted quarterly to reflect changing facts and circumstances  such as the tax audit s progress  case law developments and new or emerging legislation 
we believe that at million  the tax reserves are adequate and reflect the most probable outcome for all tax contingencies known at december  additional taxes  if any  will be determined only after completing any future tax audits 
while the timing for such payments cannot be determined  we expect that they will not be made within one year 
accordingly  the tax contingency liability is included as a long term liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset created during the period from inception through september  this allowance reflected no earnings history for spirit holdings or other positive and negative evidence that collectively determined whether we were be able to realize these assets 
the valuation allowance increased our tax provision by deferring tax benefits until such time that we determined under sfas no 
that we had sufficient earnings history to recognize those benefits 
we review the need for a valuation allowance each quarter 
during the fourth quarter in  we determined that a sufficient earnings history was established to release the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance reversal in the year ended december   resulted in a million decrease to non current intangibles  a million federal income tax benefit and a million state income tax benefit 
repayment of b advance payments the b supply agreement requires boeing to make advance payments to us for production articles in the aggregate amount of million  payable to us through we must then repay this advance  without interest  in the amount of a million offset against the purchase price of each of the first five hundred b ship sets delivered to boeing 
these repayments will not have an effect on cash flows from operations 
in the event that boeing does not take delivery of five hundred b ship sets  any advances not then repaid will first be applied against any outstanding b payments then due by boeing to us  with any remaining balance repaid at the rate of million per year beginning the year following our final delivery of a b production ship set to boeing 
accordingly  portions of the repayment liability are included as current and long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
expected backlog we estimate that  as of december   our expected backlog  primarily associated with boeing and airbus deliveries through  calculated based on contractual product prices and expected delivery volumes  will be approximately billion  based on boeing and airbus published schedules 
this is an increase of billion over our corresponding estimate as of the end of which reflects continued strong orders at boeing and airbus 
backlog is calculated based on the number of units spirit is under contract to produce on our fixed quantity contracts  and boeing or airbus announced backlog on our requirements contracts 
the number of units may be subject to cancellation or delay by the customer prior to shipment  depending on contract terms 
the level of unfilled orders at any given date during the year may be materially affected by the timing of our receipt of firm orders and additional airplane orders  and the speed with which those orders are filled 
accordingly  our expected backlog as of december  may not necessarily represent the actual amount of deliveries or sales for any future period 

table of contents foreign operations we engage in business in various non us markets 
as of december   we have a foreign subsidiary with one facility in the united kingdom  which serves as a production facility  a worldwide supplier base  and a repair center for the european and middle eastern regions 
we purchase certain components and materials that we use in our products from foreign suppliers and a portion of our products will be sold directly to foreign customers  including airbus  or resold to foreign end users ie  foreign airlines and militaries 
in addition  spirit has chosen malaysia as the location to establish its first asian manufacturing facility 
the initial plant is expected to be fully operational in early in november   we announced a joint venture operation with russian based progresstech ltd 
the new company  known as spirit progresstech llc  will operate primarily from a branch office located in moscow  russia and will begin its operations by performing engineering consulting services 
currency fluctuations  tariffs and similar import limitations  price controls and labor regulations can affect our foreign operations 
other potential limitations on our foreign operations include expropriation  nationalization  restrictions on foreign investments or their transfers and additional political and economic risks 
in addition  the transfer of funds from foreign operations could be impaired by any restrictive regulations that foreign governments could enact 
sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities with such governments countries 
furthermore  the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states may be unfavorable to our operations and growth strategy 
for the twelve months ended december   our revenues from direct sales to non us customers were approximately million  or approximately of total revenues for the same period 
for the twelve months ended december   our revenues from direct sales to non us customers were approximately million  or of total revenues for the same period 
all sales occurred during the period from april  through december   following the acquisition of spirit europe 
inflation a majority of our sales are conducted pursuant to long term contracts that set fixed unit prices  some of which provide for price adjustment for inflation 
in addition  we typically consider expected inflation in determining proposed pricing when we bid on new work 
although we have attempted to minimize the effect of inflation on our business through these protections  sustained or higher than anticipated increases in costs of labor or materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
spirit s contracts with suppliers currently provide for fixed pricing in us dollars  spirit europe s supply contracts are denominated in us dollars  british pounds sterling and euros 
in some cases our supplier arrangements contain inflationary adjustment provisions based on accepted industry indices  and we typically include an inflation component in estimating our supply costs 
as the metallic raw material industry is experiencing significant demand pressure  we expect that raw material market pricing will increase to a level that may impact our costs  despite protections in our existing supplier arrangements 
we will continue to focus our strategic cost reduction plans on mitigating the effects of this potential cost increase on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities  we are exposed to various market risks that may affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
these market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  which impact the amount of interest we must pay on our variable rate debt 
other than the interest rate swaps described below  financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments  the funds in which our pension assets are invested  and trade accounts receivable 

table of contents accounts receivable include amounts billed and currently due from customers  amounts earned but unbilled  particular estimated contract changes  claims in negotiation that are probable of recovery  and amounts retained by the customer pending contract completion 
for the twelve months ended december   approximately of our revenues were from sales to boeing 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses as deemed appropriate based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically not been material  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions and perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those financial institutions 
we have not experienced any losses in such accounts and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents 
additionally  we monitor our defined benefit pension plan asset investments on a quarterly basis and we believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk in these investments 
some raw materials and operating supplies are subject to price and supply fluctuations caused by market dynamics 
our strategic sourcing initiatives are focused on mitigating the impact of commodity price risk 
we are party to collective raw material sourcing contracts arranged through boeing  airbus and bae systems 
these collective sourcing contracts allow us to obtain raw materials at pre negotiated rates and help insulate us from disruptions associated with the unprecedented market demand across the industry for metallic and composite raw materials 
although our supply agreements with boeing and airbus allow us to pass on certain unusual increases in component and raw material costs to boeing and airbus in limited situations  we may not be fully compensated for such increased costs 
we also have long term supply agreements with a number of our major parts suppliers 
we  as well as our supply base  are experiencing delays in the receipt of  and pricing increases for  metallic raw materials primarily aluminum and titanium due to unprecedented market demand across the industry 
based upon discussions with customers and suppliers  we expect these conditions to continue through at least as metallic raw material supply adjusts to the industry upturn  market conditions shift due to increased infrastructure demand in china and russia  and aluminum and titanium usage increases in a widening range of global products 
these market conditions began to affect cost and production schedules in mid  and may have an impact on cash flows or results of operations in future periods 
we generally do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk  although we are reviewing a full range of business options focused on strategic risk management for all raw material commodities 
any failure by our suppliers to provide acceptable raw materials  components  kits or subassemblies could adversely affect our production schedules and contract profitability 
we assess qualification of suppliers and continually monitor them to control risk associated with such supply base reliance 
to a lesser extent  we also are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of certain utilities and services  such as electricity  natural gas  chemicals and freight 
we utilize a range of long term agreements to minimize procurement expense and supply risk in these areas 
interest rate risks after the effect of interest rate swaps  as of december   we had million of total fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt outstanding as compared to million of total fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt outstanding as of december  borrowings under our senior secured credit facility bear interest that varies with libor 
interest rate changes generally do not affect the market value of such debt  but do impact the amount of our interest payments and  therefore  our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
assuming other variables remain constant  including levels of indebtedness  a one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable debt would have an estimated impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next twelve months of approximately million 

table of contents as required under our senior secured credit facility  in july we entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million as follows effective fair value  variable fixed fixed december  principal amount expires rate rate rate in millions july libor july libor july libor the purpose of entering into these swaps was to reduce our exposure to variable interest rates 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the interest rate swaps are being accounted for as cash flow hedges and the fair value of the swap agreements is reported on the balance sheet as an asset  if positive  or a liability  if negative 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a net liability of approximately million at december  foreign exchange risks on april   in connection with the bae acquisition  we acquired forward foreign currency exchange contracts denominated in british pounds sterling with notional amounts totaling approximately million 
the purpose of these forward contracts is to allow spirit europe to reduce its exposure to fluctuations of us dollars 
as a result of the bae acquisition  we have sales  expenses  assets and liabilities that are denominated in british pounds sterling 
spirit europe s functional currency is the british pound sterling 
however  sales of spirit europe s products to boeing and some procurement costs are denominated in us dollars 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause net sales and our expenses to fluctuate  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
in addition  even when revenues and expenses are matched  we must translate british pound sterling denominated results of operations  assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar as compared to the british pound sterling will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in its original currency 
these transactions could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets  liabilities and shareholders equity 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the foreign exchange contracts are being accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a net asset of approximately million with a notional amount of million at december  at december   a unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have reduced our unrealized gains by million 
risk from change in millions average average net asset fair in revaluation year notional amount contract rate revaluation rate value rate in accordance with sfas no 
 the intercompany revolving credit facility with spirit europe is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the fluctuation in rates for resulted in a gain of million reflected in other income expense 
based on the current balance of million  a unfavorable exchange rate movement would have resulted in a loss of million 
other than the interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts  we have no other derivative financial instruments
