item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
refer to forward looking statements following the index and item a risk factors of this form k 
overview our business we develop  manufacture and sell a complete line of reagents and automated systems used primarily by hospitals  clinical laboratories and blood banks in tests performed to detect and identify certain properties of human blood prior to blood transfusion 
we have manufacturing facilities in the united states and canada 
we sell our products from these facilities and through our affiliates in germany  italy  belgium  spain  portugal  france and japan 
the fda regulates all aspects of the blood banking industry  including marketing of reagents and instruments used to detect and identify blood properties 
our industry has been very labor intensive but in recent years it has made noticeable advances in automating certain manual processes 
we believe that companies that successfully introduced new technologies and automated products have seen their profitability improve 
we have introduced several instruments in the past  and we continue to focus on developing new instruments and improving our existing instruments 
in june  we received fda clearance to market our latest instrument  echo  which is a compact bench top  fully automated walk away instrument for small and medium sized hospitals  blood banks and transfusion laboratories 
echo uses capture products  our proprietary reagents  and offers an extensive test menu and significant labor reduction while increasing productivity and patient safety 
we expect to increase our market share and revenues from the sale of echo  galileo and capture products in the near term 
instruments and capture products currently account for approximately of our revenues 
proposed bioarray acquisition in march  we announced the proposed acquisition of bioarray solutions ltd 
bioarray  a privately held company based in warren  nj for approximately million in cash 
bioarray has pioneered the development of molecular diagnostic systems which enable the dna typing genotyping of blood for transfusion donors and recipients 
the waiting period required under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act expired at the end of may  allowing us to proceed with the acquisition 
we are working to resolve remaining open issues and to finalize the remaining outstanding closing items as promptly as possible 
bioarray has developed  patented and introduced its beadchip system for molecular medicine  which uses arrays of proprietary microparticles to analyze dna 
its recently launched transfusion genotyping system  which has not yet received fda approval  is currently installed in a number of leading donor and transfusion centers for research applications 
we will acquire in this transaction the broad intellectual property portfolio bioarray has generated through its substantial investments in research and development  including approximately issued or pending patents 
bioarray will continue to be based in warren  nj and operate under the bioarray name 
we believe that the acquisition will enable us to provide innovative molecular diagnostic solutions for the blood transfusion market that complement our current product line  and that our leadership in blood banking industry automation and bioarray s leadership in molecular diagnostic systems for specialty transfusion applications should allow us to develop and deliver more precise genotyping solutions to enhance patient outcomes 
we also believe our capabilities in providing automated platform solutions  fda licensing experience  established distribution network and financial resources will facilitate a more rapid and extensive introduction of bioarray s beadchip products than bioarray could accomplish on its own 
we also believe that this acquisition will open up broader opportunities for us in transplantation and transfusion related applications 

table of contents 
index to financial statements bioarray has formed a new company intended to commercialize bioarray technologies in fields outside of blood transfusion and transplantation 
if the acquisition closes  the current equity holders of bioarray will hold an ownership interest in the new company  and immucor  through bioarray and for no additional consideration  will hold a ownership interest 
three key employees of bioarray have entered into employment agreements with us that will take effect upon completion of the merger 
in addition  these three employees and three other key employees of bioarray have entered into separate non competition agreements with us that will take effect upon completion of the merger 
we expect this acquisition will be materially dilutive to earnings per share for several years following closing as key investments are made in research  development  and the automation and marketing of the bioarray product line 
in our first full year of ownership  we expect this acquisition to reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately to per share  including approximately per share of non cash amortization of acquired intangible assets 
performance in fiscal  we continued to focus on increasing revenue and market share 
we concentrated our efforts on successfully marketing the echo  which received fda clearance in june  and as part of this effort  we continued to critically examine our organizational structure and modify it where necessary  including the hiring and training of additional sales  technical and contracting personnel to ensure the smooth introduction of the echo 
we also continued to place galileo instruments in the market 
as of may   we had received orders for a total of galileo instruments worldwide an increase of instruments in the fourth quarter of fiscal  including in europe  in north america and in japan  and approximately of these galileo instruments were generating reagent revenues  an increase of live instruments in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the case of our newly introduced echo  as of may   we had received orders for a total of echo instruments worldwide an increase of instruments in the fourth quarter of fiscal  including in europe  in north america and in japan  and approximately of these echo instruments were generating reagent revenues  an increase of approximately live instruments in the fourth quarter of fiscal our revenue increased by in fiscal year and by in fiscal year price increases in traditional reagents  volume increases in capture products  increases in instrument revenue recognition and exchange gains mainly contributed to the revenue increases 
we achieved gross margins of in fiscal and  compared to achieved in fiscal though we have been able to maintain our margins in all our product lines  our reporting of revenue and gross margins is affected by the application of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the accounting treatment mandated by this pronouncement results in the deferral of certain revenue for sales agreements that have multiple deliverables while the related costs are recorded up front 
as of may   may  and may   we had deferred revenue of approximately million  million and million  respectively  and a major portion of these balances related to the deferral of revenue from sale of instruments 
approximately of our fiscal consolidated net sales are from the united states and approximately are from international sales largely denominated in local currency  with the majority of these sales in euros  canadian dollars and yen 
as a result  our consolidated sales expressed in dollars benefit when the us dollar weakens and suffer when the us dollar strengthens in relation to other currencies 
currency fluctuations contributed to an increase of million and million in our consolidated sales in fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in fiscal  our net income increased by  which was in line with the increase in revenue and increase in operating expenses 
in fiscal  increased revenues  improved gross margin  and containment of expenses contributed to our achieving a record year of growth in terms of revenue and a fourth consecutive record year of growth in terms of net income 
this is reflected in the increase in our cash resources from million at may  to million at may  business outlook for fiscal  our primary focus will be to continue to market the new echo to small and medium size customers 
we will also continue to focus on placing galileo instruments with larger customers 
we are currently developing a next generation galileo that will incorporate enhanced features and functionality 
we expect to complete development and receive fda clearance for the new galileo by the end of calendar year over the next few years  we expect our core business to shift gradually from being mainly a supplier of traditional reagents to being a major supplier of automated instruments that use our proprietary capture technology and products 
however  with the probable change in sales mix as more instruments are sold  it could be difficult to sustain the overall gross margins of achieved in fiscal and fiscal the higher margins on the capture reagents used on our instruments may not be enough to offset the lower margins on the instruments themselves 
moreover  there is likely to be further pressure on our overall gross margin because we are required by eitf to expense the cost of instruments up front and then spread the revenue over the entire periods for sales contracts with reagent price guarantees 
in fiscal  we decided to sell our products directly in france instead of through a distributor  and we developed a transition plan with bio rad laboratories  inc  our former distributor 
we spent approximately million to establish the new organization in france 
in june  with the similar intent to sell our products directly in the united kingdom  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of ibg immucor limited  a private company registered in and our distributor for the united kingdom  for approximately million 
in japan  in may  we concluded a three year transition arrangement with kainos related to our purchase of its immucor distribution business 
we paid kainos the final installment of the purchase consideration amounting to japanese million approximately million in may during the transition period  we established our own office and infrastructure to enable us to sell and distribute our products directly in japan 
we expect that our decision to sell directly in france  the uk and japan will improve our margins and our market share in these markets 
listed below are the key factors which we expect will drive revenue and improve market share in fiscal increased market penetration by galileo and echo we expect to further improve our competitive position in fiscal by aggressively marketing the echo  which was released in european and us markets in the first quarter of fiscal echo is significantly smaller and faster than our abs  and has substantially all of the features of our larger instrument  galileo  apart from lower throughput 
we believe the echo will appeal to the small to medium sized hospital market  the largest segment of our customers approximately  to  worldwide  to which our abs instrument was previously marketed 
we expect to gradually increase our share in this market and increase revenues from sales of our capture products 
we also expect to continue to increase galileo placements 
we expect capture revenue to increase in fiscal as we continue to place more galileo and echo instruments in the market 
expanding our customer loyalty program we continue to offer our customer loyalty program to expand the use of our reagent throughout our customer base 
the program promotes customer loyalty and higher sales volumes by partially shielding our more loyal customers from the effects of price increases

the growth in traditional reagent revenue ie products not using our patented capture technology in fiscal compared to fiscal occurred mainly as a result of price increases in the united states 
traditional reagent sales have historically been our primary source of revenue and still constitute roughly of our revenue 
we expect the significance of this line of products to gradually decline as we place more instruments in the market and increase sales of our capture products 

table of contents 
index to financial statements sales of capture products increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal mainly due to volume increases million price increases million in the us  exchange rate gains million due to the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar and an increase million attributable to our foreign affiliates 
sales of capture products are largely dependent on the number of installed instruments requiring the use of capture reagents 
as we succeed in placing more instruments in the market  we expect revenue from capture products to increase

in the case of instruments  comparing gross margin from period to period can be misleading because of the way revenue and cost for certain types of instrument sales are recorded 
where sales contracts have price guarantee clauses  instrument costs are expensed when the sale is made  but the related revenue is deferred and recorded as income over the term of the agreement

revenue recognition ii 
trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts iii 
inventory iv 
goodwill v 
taxation vi 
stock based compensation i revenue recognition in accordance with the staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  guidance  we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
reagent sales revenue from the sale of our reagents to end users is primarily recognized upon shipment when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  unless there are specific contractual terms to the contrary 
revenue from the sale of our reagents to distributors is recognized fob customs clearance when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
medical instrument sales revenue from the sale of our medical instruments without multiple deliverables is generally recognized upon shipment and completion of contractual obligations 
revenue from rentals of our medical instruments is recognized over the term of the rental agreement 
instrument service contract revenue is recognized over the term of the service contract 
in cases of sales or rentals of instruments with multiple deliverables  we recognize revenue on the sale of medical instruments in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our medical instrument sales contracts with multiple deliverables include the sale or rental of an instrument including delivery  installation and training  the servicing of the instrument during the first year  and  in many cases  price guarantees for reagents and consumables purchased during the contract period 
we have determined the fair value of certain of these elements  such as training and first year service 
if the agreement does not include any price guarantees  the sales price in excess of the fair values of training and service is allocated to the instrument itself and recognized upon shipment and completion of contractual obligations relating to training and or installation 
the fair value of a training session is recognized as revenue when services are provided 
the fair value of first year service is recognized over the first year of the contract 
if the agreement contains price guarantees  the entire arrangement consideration is deferred and recognized over the related guarantee period due to the fair value of the price guarantee not being determinable at the point of sale 
the allocation of the total consideration  which is based on the estimated fair value of the units of accounting  requires judgment by management 
ii trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables at may   totaling million  and at may   totaling million  are net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay 
table of contents 
index to financial statements their debts 
the collectibility of trade receivable balances is regularly evaluated based on a combination of factors such as customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment patterns 
if it is determined that a customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount expected to be recovered

the standard cost system applies estimated labor and manufacturing overhead factors to inventory based on budgeted production and efficiency levels  staffing levels and costs of operation  based on the experience and judgment of management 
actual costs and production levels may vary from the standard established and such variances are charged to the consolidated statement of income as a component of cost of sales 
since us generally accepted accounting principles require that the standard cost approximate actual cost  periodic adjustments are made to the standard rates to approximate actual costs 
no material changes have been made to the inventory policy during fiscal  or iv goodwill on adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
intangible assets that have finite lives are continuing to be amortized over their useful lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as at the end of the third quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using primarily the income  or discounted cash flows  approach 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our evaluation of goodwill completed during the year resulted in no impairment charges 
v income taxes our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the value of our deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation 
table of contents 
index to financial statements allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  and we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  carry back opportunities  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we assess the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
although fin  which we adopted at the beginning of fiscal  provides further clarification on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements  the new threshold and measurement attribute prescribed by the fasb will continue to require significant judgment by management 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations 
vi stock based employee compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r  requiring companies to record share based payments to employees as compensation expense at the grant date fair value 
we adopted sfas r on june   using the modified prospective transition method  which requires that i compensation costs be recorded as earned for all unvested stock options outstanding at the beginning of the first fiscal year of adoption of sfas r based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and ii compensation costs for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to the adoption be recorded  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  we have not restated the financial statements for prior periods and those statements do not include the impact of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we elected to attribute the value of share based compensation to expense using the straight line method  which was previously used for disclosing our pro forma information required under sfas prior to adopting sfas r  we presented all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified as a part of cash flows from financing activities 
excess tax benefits are realized tax benefits from tax deductions for exercised options in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock compensation costs for such options 
we elected to value our share based payment awards using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes model  which was previously used for disclosing our pro forma information required under sfas for fiscal year the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the black scholes model requires the input of certain assumptions 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of sfas r 
we have calculated our additional paid in capital pool apic pool based on the actual income tax benefits received from exercises of stock options granted after the effective date of sfas using the long method 
the apic pool is available to absorb any tax deficiencies subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of statement no 
r s fair value method negatively impacts our results of operations 
the future impact of adoption of statement no 
r will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future  expected volatilities and expected useful lives  among other factors  present at the grant date

impact of recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
this standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas no 
applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
for financial assets and liabilities  sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which will require us to adopt these provisions in fiscal for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which will require us to adopt these provisions in fiscal we do not believe sfas no 
will have a material impact on our results of operation or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 
which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value ie  the fair value option  on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards 
the election to use the fair value option is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment 
subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for us in our fiscal year beginning june  management is currently assessing the effect of implementing this guidance  which is dependent upon the nature and extent of eligible items elected to be measured at fair value upon initial application of the standard 
however  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our results of operation or financial position 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf addresses the diversity that exists with respect to the accounting for the non refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities 
the eitf concluded that an entity must defer and capitalize non refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
entities should continue to evaluate whether they expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
eitf is effective for us in our fiscal year beginning june  we do not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 use of a simplified method in developing expected term of share options sab 
sab expresses the current view of the staff that it will accept a company s election to use the simplified method discussed in sab for estimating the expected term of plain vanilla share options regardless of whether the company has sufficient information to make more refined estimates 
as permitted by sab  we continue to use the simplified method as we do not have sufficient historical data for options with six year contractual terms to estimate the expected term of share based awards

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks for foreign currency exchange rates principally with the us dollar versus the euro  canadian dollar and japanese yen 
our financial instruments that can be affected by foreign currency fluctuations and exchange risks consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes 
it has not been our practice to actively hedge our foreign subsidiaries assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
to manage these risks  we regularly evaluate our exposure and  if warranted  may enter into various derivative transactions when appropriate 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
in fiscal years   and  we recorded foreign currency translation gains of million  million and million  respectively  for the conversion into us dollar of the net assets held by our foreign affiliates 
during these years the impact of foreign currency transactions was immaterial
