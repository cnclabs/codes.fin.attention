this is compared to million in including million primarily related to the favorable resolution of tax and other matters and million after tax related to the expiration of product warranty liabilities restructuring charges in of million related to personnel changes that support the organizational realignment at exhibitgroup giltspur 
table of contents viad completed the acquisition of melville on february  for million 
melville generated million in revenue during viad completed three additional acquisitions during the year totaling million cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  debt was million as of december  viad repurchased  shares of its common stock for million in ges revenues of million  an increase of percent over revenues segment operating income of million  an increase of percent over exhibitgroup giltspur revenues of million  an increase of percent over revenues segment operating loss of million compared to a loss in of million travel and recreation services revenues of million  an increase of percent over revenues segment operating income of million in both and non gaap measure the following discussion includes a presentation of adjusted ebitda  which is utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of viad s operations and to facilitate period to period comparisons 
adjusted ebitda is defined by viad as net income before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  impairment losses and recoveries  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations 
adjusted ebitda is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes  depreciation  debt service costs  impairment losses and recoveries  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated  thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of viad s ongoing operations 
the presentation of adjusted ebitda is supplemental to results presented under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
this non gaap measure should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with gaap 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding viad s results of operations for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of viad s business 
management uses adjusted ebitda primarily as a performance measure and believes that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to this non gaap measure is net income 
although adjusted ebitda is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  the use of adjusted ebitda is limited because it does not consider material costs  expenses and other items necessary to operate the business 
these items include debt service costs  non cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long lived assets  expenses related to us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes  impairment losses or recoveries  and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations 
because adjusted ebitda does not consider the above items  a user of viad s financial information should consider net income as an important measure of financial performance because it provides a more complete measure of the company s performance 
a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income is as follows in thousands adjusted ebitda impairment recoveries losses  net interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization income from discontinued operations net income the slight increase in adjusted ebitda of  from to was primarily driven by favorable operating income at ges and lower corporate activities expense  mostly offset by unfavorable operating results at exhibitgroup giltspur  lower interest income  higher restructuring costs and the gains on sale of corporate assets 
the increase in adjusted ebitda of 
table of contents million from to was primarily driven by favorable operating income at ges and the travel and recreation services businesses  as well as by the gains on sale of corporate assets and higher interest income 
this was partially offset by unfavorable operating results at exhibitgroup giltspur 
results of operations vs 
revenues for increased percent to billion from million in the increase was a result of strong growth at both ges including the acquisition of melville and exhibitgroup giltspur 
income before income taxes and minority interest was million for compared to million for income from continuing operations for was million  or per diluted share  down from million  or per diluted share  in the decrease in income from continuing operations was largely due to tax benefits of million in versus million in related to the favorable resolution of tax matters  a decrease in net interest income in and gains on the sale of corporate assets in these unfavorable items were partially offset by impairment recoveries of   after tax in comprised of insurance recoveries relating to assets that were damaged as a result of hurricane katrina versus net impairment losses of million  or million after tax  in net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for net income for includes income from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  relating to the settlement of a real estate participation interest associated with a parcel of land sold by a discontinued operation several years ago 
net income for includes income from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  consisting of million million pre tax related to the expiration of product warranty liabilities associated with a previously sold manufacturing operation and million primarily related to the favorable resolution of tax and other matters related to previously sold operations 
ges 
revenues for ges were million for  an increase of percent from the amount of million 
the increase was primarily driven by million in revenue from melville  as well as strong same show growth of percent and new business at ges north american operations  which was partially offset by million in negative show rotation revenue 
management defines base same show revenue growth as growth in exhibitions and events that occur in the same quarter and same city every year 
base same shows represented approximately percent of ges revenue in segment operating income increased percent to million in as compared to million in  primarily as a result of the revenue growth partially offset by an increase in insurance claims expense workers compensation and general liability and cost overruns on certain shows 
in  viad also received million related to the final settlement of its ges business interruption insurance claim resulting from hurricane katrina  which was recorded in segment operating income 
operating margins were percent in as compared to percent in in general  the exhibition and event industry is experiencing continued signs of modest growth in terms of square footage and number of exhibitors  however the pricing environment is somewhat challenging 
the prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows 
although ges has a diversified revenue base including existing contracts for future shows  revenue growth is dependent on general economic and industry specific conditions 
ges and exhibitgroup giltspur are subject to multiple collective bargaining agreements that affect labor costs  about one third of which expire each year 
although labor relations between the companies and labor are currently stable  disruptions during future contract negotiations could occur  with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of ges and or exhibitgroup giltspur 
exhibitgroup giltspur 
revenues for exhibitgroup giltspur were million for  an increase of percent from the amount of million 
the growth in revenue was primarily the result of exhibitgroup giltspur s focus on repositioning the company  which resulted in greater revenues from new clients and lower client attrition 
international revenues also increased in segment operating loss for was million versus segment operating loss of million in the loss reflects the cost of initiatives to reposition the company for growth  including higher costs for performance based incentives 
visibility over future revenues continues to be poor and a sustained increase in customer marketing spending on new exhibit construction has not materialized to date 
in response to a challenging exhibit construction market  management is focused on repositioning exhibitgroup giltspur as a marketing services firm to capture a greater share of clients marketing budgets by delivering comprehensive  innovative  value added solutions that enable clients to generate a higher return on their face to face marketing investments 
management is also focused on improving the sales pipeline and win rate to drive profitable revenue 
table of contents growth  as well as cost control  productivity enhancements and increased capacity utilization in order to improve profitability in future years 
although exhibitgroup giltspur has a diversified revenue base  revenue growth is dependent on general economic and industry specific conditions 
travel and recreation services 
revenues of the travel and recreation services segment were million for  an increase of percent from million in segment operating income was million in both and operating margins decreased to percent for from percent in the decrease in operating margins was primarily due to an increase in repairs and maintenance expense and an increase in canada s minimum wage rate which increased salary expense 
as discussed below  results in this segment were favorably impacted by exchange rates during resulting in approximately million in additional segment operating income as compared to brewster saw growth in passenger volume at its banff gondola and an increase in revenues at its mount royal hotel 
additionally  glacier park realized strong occupancy at its inns and lodges and an increase in room revenue over during  approximately percent of revenue and percent of operating income generated in viad s travel and recreation services segment was derived through its canadian operations 
these operations are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation  and accordingly  increases in the value of the canadian dollar compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes  and therefore  revenue and operating income in the travel and recreation services segment 
the operating results related to viad s canadian subsidiaries were translated into us dollars at weighted average exchange rates of and for and  respectively 
accordingly  viad s consolidated results of operations have been favorably impacted by the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar as it relates to the translation of its canadian operations 
decreases in the exchange rates may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period to period comparisons when operating results are translated into us dollars 
glacier park operates the concession portion of its business under concession contracts with the us national park service the park service for glacier national park and with the canadian government for waterton lakes national park 
glacier park s year lease with the canadian government expires in with glacier park having an option to renew for two additional terms of years each 
glacier park s original year concession contract with the park service that was to expire on december   was extended for three one year periods and now expires on december  the park service  in its sole discretion  may continue extending glacier park s concession contract in increments of one to three years 
when this contract ultimately expires  glacier park will have the opportunity to bid on a new concession contract 
if glacier park does secure a new contract  possible terms would be for  or years 
if a new concessionaire is selected by the park service  glacier park s remaining business would consist of the operations at waterton lakes national park and east glacier  montana 
in such a circumstance  glacier park would be entitled to an amount equal to its possessory interest  which generally means the value of the structures acquired or constructed  fixtures installed and improvements made to the concession property at glacier national park during the term of the concessions contract 
this value would be based on the reconstruction cost of a new unit of like kind  less physical depreciation  but not to exceed fair market value 
glacier park generated approximately percent of travel and recreation services segment operating income

see critical accounting policies and estimates for further discussion 
the following table presents viad s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands long term debt  including current portion capital lease obligations operating leases estimated interest payments pension and postretirement benefits purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations interest payments on capital lease obligations only 
interest payments on variable rate debt the credit facility  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements is indexed to libor and is excluded from the table 

table of contents estimated contributions related to multi employer benefit plans are excluded from the table above 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding those obligations 
purchase obligations primarily represent payments due under various licensing agreements and commitments related to consulting and other contracted services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including open purchase orders 
also included are multi year utility contracts for which the minimum requirements contained in the contracts are included in the table 
aggregate liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions of million including interest and penalties are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of future cash outflows is highly uncertain 
viad and certain of its subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions  proceedings and pending claims  some of which involve  or may involve  compensatory  punitive or other damages 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions  proceedings or claims could be decided against viad 
although the amount of liability as of december  with respect to these matters is not ascertainable  viad believes that any resulting liability  after taking into consideration amounts already provided for  including insurance coverage  will not have a material effect on viad s business  financial position or results of operations 
viad is subject to various us federal  state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which viad has or had operations 
if the company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations  civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders 
as is the case with many companies  viad also faces exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations

off balance sheet arrangements viad does not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated special purpose or other entities that would materially affect the company s financial position  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
furthermore  viad does not have any relationships with special purpose or other entities that provide off balance sheet financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support  or engage in leasing or other services that expose the company to liability or risks of loss that are not reflected in viad s consolidated financial statements 
see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on these criteria  viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to viad  and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates goodwill and other intangible assets viad performs annual impairment testing of its goodwill based on the estimated fair value of its reporting units  which is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital rate 
additionally  an assumed terminal value is used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal values and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based on historical experience  financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions 
viad s policy is to test goodwill for impairment annually as of october of each year or more frequently if indications of impairment exist 
as of december   viad had recorded goodwill of million and million related to ges and travel and recreation services  respectively 
viad also performs annual impairment testing of its intangible assets not subject to amortization 
in  viad recorded an impairment charge of million related to the trademark intangible at exhibitgroup giltspur 
viad s policy is to test intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment annually as of october of each year or more frequently if indications of impairment exist 
as of december   viad had recorded million of intangible assets not subject to amortization 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further disclosures regarding viad s goodwill and other intangible assets 

table of contents income taxes viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
accordingly  the company must estimate its actual current income tax liability  and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in viad s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
as of december  and  viad had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
as of both december  and  viad had a valuation allowance recorded of  related to certain state deferred tax assets at exhibitgroup giltspur 
with respect to all other deferred tax assets  management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more likely than not 
effective january   viad adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the adoption of fin resulted in a net decrease to retained earnings of million  an increase to accrued income taxes of million and an increase to deferred tax assets of million 
viad exercises significant judgment in determining its income tax provision and income tax uncertainties due to transactions  credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as of december  and january  date of adoption  viad had accrued gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for continuing operations of million and million  respectively 
in addition  as of both december  and january   viad had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for continuing operations of million 
upon adoption of fin  the company elected to continue to classify interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities as a component of income tax expense 
in addition to the above  viad had accrued gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of  as of december  and  as of january  in addition  as of december  and january   viad had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of  and  respectively 
future tax resolutions or settlements that may occur related to these uncertain tax positions would be recorded through discontinued operations net of federal tax effects  if applicable 
as of december   the entire amount of unrecognized tax benefits for continuing operations of million excluding federal income tax effects of million would favorably affect viad s effective tax rate  if recognized  as the related uncertain tax positions are permanent in nature 
however  if amounts accrued are less than amounts ultimately assessed by the taxing authorities  viad would record additional income tax expense 
to the extent that the company has favorable tax settlements  or determines that accrued amounts are no longer needed due to a lapse in the applicable statute of limitations or other reasons  such liabilities would be reversed as a reduction of income tax expense net of federal tax effects  if applicable in the period such determination is made 
the company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately million excluding federal income tax effects of million of its uncertain tax positions could be resolved or settled within the next months which would reduce the amount of accrued income taxes payable 
if such tax resolutions or settlements occur  they could result in cash payments  the recognition of additional income tax expense  or the reversal of accrued income taxes which may impact viad s effective tax rate in future periods 
insurance liabilities viad is self insured up to certain limits for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability and property loss claims 
the aggregate amount of insurance liabilities related to viad s continuing operations was million as of december  of this total  million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining million related to general auto liability claims 
viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses totaling million as of december   primarily related to workers compensation liabilities 
provisions for losses for claims incurred  including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported  are made based on viad s historical experience  claims frequency and other factors 
a change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities 
viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self insured levels  which generally range from  to  on a per claim basis 
viad does not maintain a self insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement 
viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were million and million in and  respectively 
pension and postretirement benefits viad s pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation 
funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations 
the company presently anticipates contributing  to its funded pension plans and  to its unfunded pension plans in viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees  retirees and dependents 
the related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period 
table of contents that services are provided by employees 
in addition  viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses 
while the plans have no funding requirements  viad expects to contribute  to the plans in the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for post age plan participants was eight percent in the year  declining one percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
for pre age plan participants  the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was seven percent in the year  declining one percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for post age plan participants was nine percent in the year  declining one percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
for pre age plan participants  the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was eight percent in the year  declining one percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  the weighted average discount rates used to determine the domestic pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of november  were percent and percent  respectively 
the discount rate was percent for these plans 
the weighted average discount rates used to determine the foreign pension benefit obligations as of december  and were percent and percent  respectively 
the weighted average discount rates used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the domestic plans for and were both percent 
the net periodic benefit cost for the foreign pension plans used weighted average discount rates of percent for both and the discount rates used in determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review  and reflect the estimated rates of return on a high quality  hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flows match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments 
the expected return on plan assets used to determine the domestic net periodic pension cost for and were percent and percent  respectively 
the foreign pension plans used a rate of percent for both and the expected return on plan assets used to determine net periodic postretirement benefit cost for and were percent and percent  respectively

 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement and not an entity specific measurement 
accordingly  fair value measurements should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
sfas no 
generally applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  except for share based payment transactions and other limited exceptions 
sfas no 
was originally effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 which partially defers the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november  for items within its scope

viad adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
as of december  however  the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after december  viad currently utilizes a november measurement date for certain of its pension and postretirement benefit plans and has not yet determined if the adoption of the remaining provisions of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no

r provides guidance in accounting for step acquisitions  contingent liabilities  goodwill  contingent consideration  and other aspects of business combinations 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  accordingly  viad will adopt sfas no

interest rate risk is the risk that changing interest rates will adversely affect the earnings of viad 
commodity risk is the risk that changing prices will adversely affect results of operations 
viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in canada and the united kingdom and to a lesser extent in certain other european countries 
the functional currency of viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency 
accordingly  for purposes of consolidation  viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into us dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in viad s consolidated balance sheets 
as a result  significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar may result in material changes to viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets 
viad does not currently hedge its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
viad had cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation gains recorded in equity of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
during and  an unrealized foreign currency translation gain of million and a loss of  respectively  were recorded in other comprehensive income 
in addition  for purposes of consolidation  the revenues  expenses  gains and losses related to viad s foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period 
as a result  viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as the operating results of its foreign subsidiaries  when translated  may vary from period to period  even when the functional currency amounts have not changed 
such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period to period comparisons 
viad does not currently hedge its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results 
as noted above  viad primarily conducts its foreign operations in canada and the united kingdom 
accordingly  the operating results related to its canadian subsidiaries were translated into us dollars at weighted average exchange rates of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accordingly  viad s segment operating income has been favorably impacted by approximately million in from the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar as it relates to the translation of its canadian operations

the operating results of melville have been included in viad s consolidated financial statements from the february  acquisition date 
viad is exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk as its foreign subsidiaries have certain revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary 
from time to time  viad utilizes forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  net of the effect of the related forward contracts  has historically been immaterial to viad s consolidated results of operations 
as of december   viad had aggregate contracts to sell us dollars of million notional amount in exchange for canadian dollars at an average contract rate of canadian dollars per us dollar  which matured on various 
table of contents dates through september the fair value of these contracts was  as of december  and is included in the consolidated balance sheet under the caption other current liabilities

periodically  one of these subsidiaries enters into futures contracts with an oil company to purchase two types of fuel and specifies the monthly total volume  by fuel product  to be purchased over the agreed upon term of the contract  which is generally no longer than one year 
the main objective of viad s risk policy related to changing fuel prices is to reduce transaction exposure in order to mitigate the cash flow risk and protect profit margins 
there were no fuel contracts outstanding as of december
