table of contents significant financing transactions the state of california public employee s retirement system  or calpers  had been a substantial investor in our predecessor business 
in february  calpers had provided our predecessor business with capital in the form of a revolving credit facility in the principal amount of approximately million 
we used a portion of the net proceeds of our offering to pay all amounts outstanding under the calpers facility  including million in accrued interest  and terminated the facility 
we further reduced interest expense by repaying approximately million of net principal mortgage debt secured by our projects 
revenue base as of december  and  we had and projects  respectively  that were classified as rental properties 
we receive revenue primarily from rental income including tenant reimbursements from commercial and industrial properties  which is included as rental income in the financial statements of our company and our predecessor business 
we also generate a small amount of management fee revenue by providing property management  leasing and development services to properties that are owned by affiliates 
however  our business plan is distinctive in that we focus on urban infill development and on finding different  more profitable uses for existing urban properties 
such properties may have substantial vacancies or unstable occupancies or require major renovation for a new use 
because we are foremost a redeveloper and the large majority of our projects are not complete  we do not believe that the results of our current leasing operations are indicative of the inherent value of our existing portfolio 
recent developments in january  we engaged a third party broker to actively market our project at san fernando road for sale  and concurrently  we classified this project as held for sale in accordance with sfas we entered into a purchase and sale agreement on march  pursuant to which we agreed to sell this project 
the purchase agreement is subject to customary conditions  including the buyer s completion of a due diligence investigation to its satisfaction 
we expect this sale to close in april  although there is no assurance that any of the closing conditions will be timely fulfilled or that the transaction will in fact close 
assuming the sale is completed as anticipated  we expect to receive net sale proceeds ie after the loan secured by this project and all other costs of sale are paid in excess of million 
see note of item financial schedules notes to consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information 
on march  we entered into a letter of intent pursuant to which we will agree to sell substantially our entire project at e 
th street  and concurrently  we classified this project as held for sale in accordance with sfas the purchase agreement would be subject to customary conditions  including the buyer s completion of a due diligence investigation to its satisfaction 
we expect this sale would close in may  although there is no assurance that any of the closing conditions would be timely fulfilled or that the transaction would in fact close 
assuming the sale is completed as anticipated  we expect to receive net sale proceeds ie after the loan secured by this project and all other costs of sale are paid in excess of million 
see note of item financial schedules notes to consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information 
on march  we entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell a project we have the right to acquire at alameda 
the purchase agreement is subject to very limited conditions 
we expect this sale to close on march   although there is no assurance that any of the closing conditions will be timely fulfilled or that the transaction will in fact close 
assuming the sale is completed as anticipated  we expect to receive net sale proceeds ie after all costs of sale are paid of approximately million 
see note of item financial schedules notes to consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information 
in our formation transactions in connection with our ipo  we acquired a contingent note receivable held by our predecessor business 
the obligor on the contingent note receivable is an entity owned by the two affiliates described above 
we refer to this obligor as the taylor yards entity 
the taylor yards entity in turn owns a property that we refer to as the taylor yards property 
the contingent note receivable evidences amounts drawn under our predecessor business credit facility provided by calpers  which amounts were loaned to the taylor yards entity by our predecessor business to acquire the taylor yards property 
the taylor yards entity and the taylor yards property were not contributed to us as part of our formation transactions because the taylor yards property was  and remains  subject to condemnation proceedings by the los angeles unified school district 
however  the amount of consideration we delivered in our formation transactions for our initial projects to the two affiliates of messrs 
meruelo and maddux was effectively reduced by an amount equivalent to the contingent note receivable 

table of contents pursuant to the arrangement  we agreed that  if and when amounts owing under the contingent note receivable are paid and are no longer subject to litigation risk  we would issue to affiliates of messrs 
meruelo and maddux a total number of shares of common stock having a value equal to such payments valuing the common stock for this purpose at the per share price in our ipo  plus pay their interest at the applicable federal rate in effect from the date of the ipo closing through the date of the stock issuance 
on february   in consideration of payments made under the note receivable  we issued a total of  shares pursuant to the contingent issuance arrangement 
in addition  on march   we issued  shares to affiliates of mssrs 
meruelo and maddux that we had a contingent obligation to issue based on amounts that were previously paid to our company by the taylor yards entity and that have since become no longer subject to litigation risk 
as a result of such litigation risk being removed  the company has no contingent or other obligation to return such amounts received 
any further payment of the contingent note receivable and any further contingent issuance of stock depends on the amount of the condemnation proceeds for the taylor yards property 
we have a remaining obligation to issue up to  additional shares if and when amounts owing under the contingent note receivable are paid and no longer subject to litigation risk 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of our company and our predecessor are based upon the consolidated and combined financial statements  and schedules which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period 
actual amounts may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have summarized below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable as of that date 
real estate held for development real estate held for development includes land and buildings at cost we intend to or have begun developing 
we start to capitalize costs to real estate held for development as we take steps required to prepare the property for its intended use 
project costs associated with the development and construction of a real estate project  including land  entitlement and building improvement costs  are capitalized as construction in progress 
in addition  interest  loan fees  real estate taxes  general and administrative expenses that are directly associated with the development are also capitalized in the period in which they are incurred 
we reduce these capitalized costs for incidental revenue generated from tenant leases  parking income and movie shoots 
once the real estate project is completed and the project is ready for its intended use  the costs capitalized to construction in progress and the land and building costs associated with the completed project are transferred to rental properties on the consolidated balance sheet as the historical cost of the project 
rental properties rental properties  including land  building improvements and capitalized leasing commissions  are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our assets for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our buildings and building improvements 
these assessments are primarily based upon our decision to either develop or operate a property 
for example  if we determine that we will be developing a property and the building will be replaced upon commencement of construction  the estimated useful life will be the time from the date of purchase to the estimated date of demolition 
upon completion of the development  buildings and building improvements are depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
tenant improvements are depreciated over the term of the respective tenant leases 
capitalized lease commissions are amortized over the term of the related leases 

table of contents costs related to the acquisition and improvement of the rental properties are capitalized  while expenses for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred 
certain expenses such as property taxes  utilities and repair and maintenance costs are chargeable to the tenants as provided in their lease agreements 
such reimbursements are recorded as rental income in the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
costs related to terminated deal costs are expensed when we cease due diligence and related acquisition efforts 
the acquisition of real estate properties is accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas whereby the value of real estate acquired is allocated between land  buildings and improvements  acquired leasing commissions and tenant coordination costs  and to acquired above and below market leases and tenant relationships 
the fair value of tangible assets is determined on an as if vacant basis based upon comparable sales and other relevant information obtained in connection with the acquisition of the property 
the estimated fair value of acquired in place at market leases are the costs we would have incurred to lease property to the occupancy level of the property at the date of acquisition 
such estimate includes the fair value of leasing commissions and legal costs that would be incurred to lease the property to this occupancy level 
additionally  we evaluate the time period over which such occupancy level would be achieved and include an estimate of the net operating costs primarily real estate taxes  insurance and utilities incurred during the lease up period  which generally ranges up to eight to nine months 
these allocations have a direct impact on our results of operations as allocations between land  buildings and improvements because  if we were to allocate more value to land  there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount 
if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
of the securities and exchange commission  revenue recognition sab  as amended 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
all leases are classified as operating leases and minimum rents are recognized on lease terms exceeding one year on a straight line basis over the term of the respective leases 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in accounts receivable in the consolidated and combined balance sheets 
recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance expenses  real estate property taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the associated costs are incurred 
in addition  the company records a capital asset for leasehold improvements constructed by us that are reimbursed by tenants  with the offsetting amount recorded to deferred revenue which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the deferred revenue is amortized as additional rental revenue over the life of the related lease 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of tenants to make required lease payments 
if a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance  we may recognize bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and deferred rent 
rental revenue from month to month leases or leases with no scheduled rent increases or other adjustments is recognized on a monthly basis when earned 
lease termination fees are recorded when the related leases are canceled and our company has no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
lease termination fees are included in rental revenues and were not material for the years ended december   and we recognize gains on sales of real estate pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the property 
if the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition and accounts for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  installment or cost recovery methods  as appropriate  until the sales criteria are met 

table of contents evaluation of asset impairment we evaluate a property for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current book value of the property may not be recoverable pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in the event that these periodic assessments result in a determination that the carrying amount of a property exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest that are expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the property  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of the property 
estimates of expected future net cash flows are inherently uncertain and are based on assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
these estimates require us to make assumptions relating to  among other things  future rental rates  tenant allowances  operating expenditures  property taxes  capital improvements  occupancy levels  and the estimated proceeds generated from the future sale of the property 
no impairment was identified at december  or  as projected undiscounted cash flows were sufficient to recover the current book value  although a change in our strategy or a significant change in market conditions could require that we recognize an impairment loss  and such a loss could be material 
factors that may influence future results of operations the following is a summary of the more significant factors we believe may affect our results of operations 
for a more detailed discussion  see the information under the caption risk factors elsewhere in this report 
development and redevelopment activities we believe that our development and redevelopment activities present growth opportunities for us over the next several years 
we continually evaluate the size  timing and scope of our development and redevelopment initiatives and  as necessary  sales activity to reflect the economic conditions and the real estate fundamentals that exist 
however  development and redevelopment of our projects is highly speculative and subject to timing  budgeting and other risks  including cyclical over building or over investing within certain real estate submarkets and changing political situations that may interfere with our proposed uses of projects 
in particular  we are subject to increases in the costs of materials especially in the price of steel  lumber  dry wall  copper and concrete  which are significant components of construction costs caused by changing market conditions  including increased global demand 
we are also affected by changes in laws and regulations including the land use entitlement processes  particularly in the city of los angeles  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws  their regulations and policies 
increases in interest rates will increase our borrowing costs and our overall development or redevelopment costs for a project 
in addition  customers may be unwilling or unable to purchase our for sale residential units at times when mortgage financing costs are high or as borrower credit quality declines 
finally  changes in availability of capital will affect our ability to develop our projects  including timing and the type and extent of development 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
rental revenue the amount of net rental income generated by our rental properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space as well as space in newly developed or redeveloped properties and space available from unscheduled lease terminations 
the amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates 
we operate in the greater los angeles area and  accordingly  market conditions in this area have a significant impact on our results of operations 
the amount of rental income is also significantly impacted by our ability to attract and retain large tenants in our properties 
our top tenants comprise of our annualized base rental revenues as of december  in addition  our largest tenant is american apparel  who leases  square feet of industrial space as of december  this lease represents of our annualized base rental revenue for the year ended december   but expires on december  in addition  we have one other tenant  fedex  whose lease represents of our annualized base rental revenue as of december  the fedex lease expires in october  however fedex has the option to extend the term of the lease for an additional five years 
no other tenant comprises more than of our portfolio s total rentable square feet or annualized base rental revenues 

table of contents effect of credit market disruptions our primary objective is to maximize return on investment through development and redevelopment activities  and these activities require significant amounts of capital 
the current disruption in the credit markets has made it more difficult for us to obtain debt financing 
it has also caused us to evaluate additional sources of capital and cash flow 
this disruption has or may affect us in a number of ways  including by making it more difficult for us to obtain financing on attractive terms  resulting in lower loan to value ratios and loan to cost ratios  higher interest rates and generally less available debt capital  creating the need to evaluate and adjust as appropriate our previously disclosed development and redevelopment plans and timelines both commencement and completion dates to correlate with adjustments in the availability of capital and other current and changing market conditions  increasing our projected development costs and the percentage and therefore amount of equity we are required to contribute to our projects  moving sales and leasing revenue from our properties from earlier periods to subsequent periods  thereby not eliminating our negative cash flow as quickly as we anticipate and as a result reducing our liquidity more than anticipated  leading us to decide to sell certain assets that we believe have reached near term maximum value or which are not central to our development or redevelopment plans  or which are otherwise in the best interests of the company to sell  leading us to enter into joint venture agreements with respect to certain of our more capital intensive projects  leading us to seek debt or equity linked capital available to public companies and leading us to refocus certain previously anticipated longer term development projects to produce more near term income through leasing the project and thereby reducing capital outflows through the redevelopment process and increasing near term cash flow 
scheduled lease expirations our ability to re lease space subject to expiring leases will impact our results of operations and is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets as well as the desirability of our individual properties 
as of december   approximately million square feet  or of the square footage held for lease  of our portfolio of wholly owned rental and development projects was available for lease 
to allow for flexibility in our redevelopment strategy  we generally seek to execute month to month leases with tenants in our properties that have not yet been developed to what we consider to be their highest and best use 
as of december   month to month leases represent approximately of the annualized base rent of our portfolio of owned projects 
the following table sets forth a summary schedule of lease expirations for leases in place at our owned projects as of december  year of lease termination number of leases expiring square footage of expiring leases percentage of total rentable square feet annualized base rent of expiring leases percentage of portfolio annualized base rent month to month thereafter total based on total square footage of  which is the total square footage of space leased or available or offered for lease at both rental and development projects and excludes substantial portions of square footage in the projects that are not available or offered for lease because of redevelopment or repositioning activities 
parking square footage is not included in the calculation 
based on annualized base rent paid or payable as of december  because annualized base rent is not derived from historical results that were accounted for in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  historical results differ from the annualized amounts 
annualized base rent does not include parking income 

table of contents results of operations executive summary when reviewing this document  it is important to be aware that the company became a publicly owned entity on january  our operating results for the year ended december   were in line with management s expectations 
we are first and foremost a development company  and while we seek to maximize net rental revenues  our primary objective is to maximize return on investment through development and redevelopment activities 
in light of the current and changing credit market conditions and availability of capital  we are evaluating and adjusting as appropriate our previously disclosed development and redevelopment plans  timelines and costs 
we have completed construction work on the residential portion of our union lofts project and began leasing the project in march we are continuing the construction work on the restaurant lounge space  which we anticipate will be completed by the end of the restaurant lounge space has already been leased 
we have also continued construction activity on a residential unit tower at w 
ninth street  which we anticipate will be completed in the ipo significantly affected our results for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  during which period our predecessor business operated 
we used ipo proceeds to pay down existing mortgage debt and to pay off the calpers mezzanine loan facility incurred by our predecessor business as was contemplated in connection with our ipo 
this has substantially reduced interest expense for the current year 
we have also used ipo proceeds to acquire eight properties  three of which are identified here as rental properties 
in addition  we acquired four parcels attached to existing rental properties and placed them in service upon purchase 
these acquisitions  together with acquisitions of rental properties during  have affected the comparability of rental income as well as rental expenses 
a portion of the ipo proceeds was invested in a money market account throughout the year  increasing our interest income compared to the prior year period 
while we have seen an increase in revenue from rental properties during the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december   this may not be a predictable measure of our performance for the future 
the majority of our assets were acquired with development or redevelopment plans in mind and only seven of the rental projects have a current use that is unlikely to be altered within the next five years 
we classify a property as either a rental property or as real estate held for development 
some properties classified as real estate held for development may generate cash flow for example  from parking operations  but such cash flow is ancillary to the development and is not reported as rental income but instead is offset against costs that are capitalized 
most of the properties categorized as rental properties were acquired in part or in whole for their redevelopment potential  and  as our market area continues to undergo significant change  we believe the redevelopment potential of rental properties will increase 
see below for additional information regarding our acquisition and development activities 
ongoing redevelopment activity at rental properties  or portions thereof  will continue to change gross rental property income on a portfolio wide basis until such time that the majority of our current development pipeline has been fully developed 
this has the effect of temporarily reducing net operating income in certain cases until such time as the development or redevelopment projects are completed and leased 
during the year ended december  we experienced rental income declines at seventh street produce market due to county health department enforcement actions at this project 
these enforcement actions resulted in a number of our tenants being forced to cease operations and ultimately leave their tenanted space 
we believe these declines will be temporary and ultimately reversed as we implement a plan of best practices tenant education as well as a physical rehabilitation for this facility 
the triple net lease with rockwell collins at pomona village expired on january  causing revenue to decline and operating expenses to increase 
we also began to reserve for potential property tax increases that may result from our formation transactions 

table of contents in addition to these factors  we experienced several significant changes in our accounting as a result of our ipo that affect the comparability of our results 
these changes include certain purchase accounting adjustments recorded under statement of financial standard sfas no 
 business combinations  for the fair value of real estate  which affect depreciation and amortization expense 
in addition  the adjustments increasing the fair value of the real estate subsequently increased our deferred income tax liabilities and paid in capital 
acquisition and development activities the comparability of our results of operations is significantly affected by our development and acquisition activities in and at december   we owned interests in rental projects and projects held as real estate for development 
at december   we owned interests in rental projects and projects held as real estate for development

table of contents comparison of the year ended december  to year ended december the following table reflects our consolidated and combined statements of operations for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december  predecessor increase decrease revenue rental income management fees interest income other income expenses rental expenses interest expense depreciation and amortization general and administrative operating loss discontinued operations gain on sale of real estate loss before income taxes for purposes of comparison  amounts include the predecessor results for the period from january  to january  and our company results for the period from january  to december  rental income 
rental income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  an increase of million is attributable to rental operations at san fernando road  the j restaurant and s 
alameda  which had limited or no operation in the prior year 
we also had increased rental income from other properties of million offset by rental declines at pomona village and seventh street produce market of million  which include the previously discussed rockwell collins lease expiration at pomona village and occupancy decreases at the seventh street produce market that are a result of health department actions 
management fees 
management fees decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to the reduction in fees applicable to the taylor yards property 
we reduced management fees on june  due to the condemnation proceedings and the fact that developing activities ceased partially offset by an increase in construction services to affiliated entities during interest income 
interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  an increase of million is attributable to interest income from investing the funds from our ipo offset by a decrease in the interest income from affiliate note receivable of million  which is due to a decrease in the interest rate from to pursuant to an agreement with the affiliated parties 
other income 
other income  which is primarily composed of leasing our space to businesses in the entertainment industry for filming  decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to fewer filming contracts in the current year compared to the prior year 

table of contents rental expenses 
rental expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is attributable to the operation of rental properties placed in service during or and which had limited or no operations during the year ended december  in addition  as a result of the previously discussed rockwell collins triple net lease expiration at pomona village  rental expenses increased by approximately million 
finally  we began accruing for estimated property tax contingencies resulting from our formation transactions 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to the payoff of the calpers credit facility and other mortgage debt instruments from our ipo proceeds and the cessation of amortization of loan costs associated with the calpers note 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased real estate values as a result of property acquisitions and the purchase of additional interests in the current portfolio 
in addition  during the current year  we reclassified certain amounts between land and building and improvements  which resulted in increased depreciation expense 
see note of the note to the consolidated and combined financial statements in item of this report for more information 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a result of our ipo in the current year 
since the ipo  we have added staff and infrastructure to accommodate the requirements of becoming a public company  which resulted in increased compensation and administrative costs such as director fees  director and officer insurance  investor relations fees and transfer agent costs 
we have also incurred significantly higher consulting and professional fees associated with corporate governance and compliance with sec regulations ie sarbanes oxley  audit fees 
in addition  we implemented the equity incentive plan  which resulted in stock compensation expense  which was not present in the prior period 
gain on sale of real estate 
gain on sale of real estate decreased by million for the year december  compared to the year ended december   due to the sale of leonis cold storage to an unrelated third party in may there were no sales during results of operations of predecessor business our predecessor s combined results of operations for the years ended december  and reflect the operations of acquired properties from the respective dates of acquisition

table of contents we are a development company  are not currently generating positive operating cash flow and require significant capital to satisfy contractual purchase and development commitments  to pay indebtedness maturing over the next year and to pursue discretionary development 
as of december   our book value of real estate held for development was approximately million  and the current carrying costs associated with our development projects is approximately million per month 
carrying costs consist primarily of interest  property taxes and development staff salaries  all of which are capitalized 
in addition to the ongoing carrying costs we incur for our development properties  we have incurred a monthly loss in after tax cash flow of approximately million per month since becoming a public company 
through sales of properties and improved operations  we expect our after tax cash flow to be positive for our liquidity requirements for consist primarily of the following approximately million in development commitments relating to our w th street project 
approximately million to satisfy those of our borrowings that mature in see contractual commitments below 
approximately million to acquire three of our projects that are currently subject to purchase rights e 
washington blvd  gold s gym and overland terminal 
we believe that we can delay our acquisition of these projects for several months  if we were to elect to do so 
we could not be legally compelled to complete such purchases  but in the event we did not complete such purchases  we would forfeit deposits aggregating million 
approximately million of planned but uncommitted i 
e  discretionary capital improvements to our operating properties 
approximately million in interest  real property tax and other costs to carry our development projects  before any on site development activity 
in addition  we are subject to an aggregate of approximately million in purchase obligations net of deposits to acquire three other development projects wall street market  american fish and oak street 
we currently expect to acquire and concurrently sell the american fish and oak street projects 
we have arranged with dynamic builders  the counterparty to our purchase obligation on wall street market  to market and sell the wall street market project to another party 
lastly  we note that certain of our lenders may have the ability to accelerate indebtedness of ours totaling million  or million of which is due in and is included in the million of borrowing described above 
see risk factors risks related to our debt financings we may be in technical default under certain of our financing arrangements 
the disruption in the credit markets has made it more difficult for us to obtain needed debt financing 
for example  lenders are more frequently requiring enterprise level guarantees for debt financing  are taking longer to make lending decisions and are generally applying more stringent underwriting standards 
nevertheless  in general  we expect our regional and local market lenders to continue to provide us with debt financing opportunities 
we also expect to enter into debt financing transactions with lenders during with respect to which we do not currently have a credit relationship 
whether with respect to regional  local or other lenders  we expect that lenders more stringent underwriting standards will lengthen the period to close lending transactions and will decrease loan to value ratios 
during  we have benefited  and expect to continue to benefit for the remainder of the year  from interest rate reduction actions taken by the federal reserve in its efforts to moderate the credit market disruptions  which have correspondingly lowered the interest rates on some of our variable rate notes 
our expected cash sources to fund our liquidity requirements for the balance of consist of the following net operating income from our operating properties  including revenues from e 
washington blvd  gold s gym and overland terminal  which will be classified as rental properties and generate revenue after acquisition

washington blvd  gold s gym and overland terminal  we may enter into concurrently with their acquisition 
proceeds from the sale of certain of our rental properties and development projects that we now intend to sell 
we have entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell our san fernando road property 
this purchase and sale agreement is subject to customary conditions  including the buyers completion of a due diligence investigation to its satisfaction 
this sale is scheduled to close in april  although there is no assurance that the closing conditions will be timely fulfilled or that the transaction will in fact close 
assuming the sale is completed as anticipated  we expect to receive net sale proceeds ie  after the loan secured by this project and all other costs of sale have been paid in excess of million 
we are currently negotiating with other buyers with regard to the sale of certain other properties 
refinancings of the approximately million in debt maturing in we expect to accomplish this primarily with the existing lenders of the debt and with local and regional lenders with which we have relationships  although we also expect to have the opportunity to refinance a portion of this debt with lenders with respect to which we do not currently have a credit relationship 
in addition  we are actively pursuing additional cash sources in and considering actions that would delay or reduce our liquidity needs 
these actions include improving net operating income from our rental properties  including by revising certain of our development plans to convert development projects into smaller scale income producing projects that will generate revenue sooner 
delaying or scaling back discretionary development  including foregoing portions of the approximately million in uncommitted capital expenditures identified above 
obtaining a construction loan for our w 
th street project 
we have a non binding term sheet from a third party for a construction loan for this project  and we are currently negotiating the definitive  binding loan documents 
while we can make no assurances  we expect this proposed loan to close no later than april obtaining borrowings secured by our unencumbered properties 
the borrowings may take the form of a corporate level secured credit facility as well as asset by asset financings consistent with our past financing practices 
during the fourth quarter of we closed nine loans with total loan proceeds of million 
seven of those loans were refinancings and two were loans secured by previously unencumbered assets 
entering into joint ventures in respect of our larger or more capital intensive development projects 
issuing debt or equity linked debt to private or public capital markets investors 
based on the foregoing and the additional actions we are considering  our management believes that we will have sufficient capital to satisfy our liquidity needs over the next months

net cash used in investing activities decreased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  most of this decrease or million resulted from acquiring properties costing million during  as compared to million in the earlier year 
the decrease also is due to proceeds from the sale of real estate during offset by an increase in capitalized costs  escrow deposits and improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  a decrease of million is a result of obtaining funding on the calpers note during with no funding during also a decrease of million is attributable to obtaining less net proceeds from notes secured by real estate during than other supplemental data industry analysts generally consider earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and after tax cash flows atcf as alternative measures of performance for public companies 
ebitda is defined as net income loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we believe it is a useful financial performance measure for us and for our stockholders and is a complement to net income and other financial performance measures provided in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap 
we use ebitda to measure the financial performance of our operating properties because it excludes expenses such as depreciation and amortization  taxes and interest expense  which are not indicative of operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance irrespective of our capital structure or how we finance our properties and operations 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  which can vary from property to property based on a variety of factors unrelated to the properties financial performance  we can more accurately assess the financial performance of our properties 
under gaap  real estate properties are recorded at historical cost at the time of acquisition and are depreciated on a straight line basis 
by excluding depreciation and amortization  we believe ebitda provides a basis for measuring the financial performance of properties unrelated to historical cost 
however  because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  it does not measure the capital we require to maintain or preserve our fixed assets 
in addition  because ebitda does not reflect interest expense  it does not take into account the total amount of interest we pay on outstanding debt nor does it show trends in interest costs due to changes in our borrowings or changes in interest rates 
ebitda  as calculated by us  may not be comparable to ebitda reported by other companies that do not define ebitda exactly as we define the term 
because we use ebitda to evaluate our financial performance  we reconcile it to net income loss  which is the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity

table of contents impact of inflation  changing prices and economic conditions residential projects the market value of a unit in a proposed residential project can vary significantly due to changing market conditions  and there may be a significant amount of time before we can develop our residential projects and offer units available for sale or rent 
commercial projects many of our commercial leases provide for fixed base rent increases and operating expense reimbursements 
we believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by these contractual rent increases and expense reimbursements 
total portfolio prices of residential units and sales and commercial rental activities in the los angeles market have a large impact on our profitability because we conduct substantially all of our business in this market 
these prices or rents could decline from time to time for market specific reasons  including adverse economic conditions due to  among other things  the failure or decline of key industries and employers affecting the local  regional or national economies 
if the prices of residential units or sales or commercial rental activity decline in the key market in which we operate  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on mortgage loans and other forms of debt financing 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
the following tables set forth our debt obligations outstanding and their maturities as of december  in thousands principal due by year thereafter total fixed rate debt instruments variable rate debt instruments total debt weighted average interest rate we calculate the fair value of our notes payable based on a currently available market rate  assuming the loans are outstanding through maturity and considering the collateral 
in determining the current market rate for fixed rate debt  a market spread is added to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to debt 
at december   the aggregate fair value of our our secured notes payable is estimated to be approximately equal to million 
as of december   the estimated fair value of the note payable and the calpers credit facility was approximately million 
as of december   we had approximately million in variable rate financing outstanding  which represented approximately of consolidated total indebtedness 
if interest rates were to increase by basis points  or approximately of our weighted average rate  the combined increase in interest expense and capitalized interest would decrease our cash flows by approximately million annually
