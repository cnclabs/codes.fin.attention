competition the market for otc pharmaceutical and nutritional products is highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on price  quality and assortment of products  customer service  marketing support and availability of new products 
the company believes it competes favorably in these areas 
the company s competition in store brand products consists of several publicly traded and privately owned companies  including brand name pharmaceutical companies 
the competition is highly fragmented in terms of both geographic market coverage and product categories  such that a competitor generally does not compete across all product lines 
some of the company s competitors are accumed inc  actavis group hf  guardian drug company  lnk international  inc  nbty inc 
and taro pharmaceutical industries ltd 
the company s store brand products also compete with nationally advertised brand name products 
most of the national brand companies have financial resources substantially greater than those of the company 
national brand companies could in the future manufacture store brand products or lower prices of national brand products 
additionally  competition is growing from generic prescription drug manufacturers that may market products that require fda approval or that have switched or are switching from rx to otc status 
the company competes in the nutritional area with a number of publicly traded and privately owned companies  some of which have broader product lines and larger sales volumes than the company does

the applications were for the following products clobetasol propionate foam  ciclopirox topical solution and cetirizine syrup 
the company  on its own or in conjunction with a partner  has ten generic rx drug applications currently pending approval with the fda 
collaboration agreements from time to time  the company may enter into agreements with other pharmaceutical companies to collaboratively develop  manufacture and market a particular product or group of products 
these types of agreements are not uncommon in the pharmaceutical industry 
the company may choose to enter into these types of agreements in order to  among other things  leverage its or that of others scientific research and development expertise or utilize its extensive marketing and distribution resources 
in may  the company entered into a collaborative agreement with cobrek pharmaceuticals cobrek  a newly formed entity of pentech pharmaceuticals inc pentech  a privately owned company that specializes in the research and development of niche generic dosage forms 
pentech contributed its anda filing for a generic equivalent to luxiq foam  a  branded pharmaceutical product  to the agreement 
perrigo will contribute two of its early stage generic topical pipeline products 
the parties will share the development costs and profits generated by these products  with perrigo being the exclusive distributor

the revenues recognized under this agreement  which totaled   and  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  are included within service and royalty revenues in the rx pharmaceuticals segment discussion included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competition the market for generic prescription drugs is subject to intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers  brand name pharmaceutical companies launching their own generic version of a branded product known as an authorized generic  manufacturers of branded drug products that continue to produce those products after patent expirations and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs 
among the company s competitors in the topical generics market are actavis us  fougera  paddock laboratories  sandoz  taro pharmaceutical  teva pharmaceutical  and triax pharmaceuticals  as well as brand name pharmaceutical companies where the company offers a generic equivalent 
the company believes that one of its primary competitive advantages is its ability to introduce difficult to develop and or manufacture topical generic equivalents to brand name drug products 
generally  these products are exposed to less competition due to the relatively longer development  clinical trials and approval processes 
in addition  the company believes it has a favorable competitive position due primarily to its efficient distribution systems  customer service and overall reputation 

table of contents price competition from additional generic versions of the same product  as well as potential price competition from the original branded or authorized generic products  may result in significant and or rapid decline in sales and profit margins 
in addition  competitors may also develop their products more rapidly or complete the regulatory approval process sooner and market their products earlier than the company 
new drugs and future developments in improved and or advanced drug delivery technologies or other therapeutic techniques may provide therapeutic or cost advantages to competing products 
further  industry consolidation may result in additional competitive price pressure 
many brand name competitors try to prevent  discourage or delay the use of generic equivalents through various measures  including introduction of new branded products  legislative initiatives  changing dosage form or dosing regimen just prior to introduction of a generic equivalent  regulatory processes  filing new patents or patent extensions  litigation  citizens petitions and negative publicity 
in addition  brand name companies sometimes launch  either through an affiliate or licensing arrangements with another company  an authorized generic at or near the time that the first generic product is launched depriving the marketer of that generic product of the exclusivity intended by the hatch waxman amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act hatch waxman 
see information applicable to all reported segments government regulation us food and drug administration below 
many of the company s customers  which are chain drug stores  hospitals and hospital systems  wholesalers and group purchasing organizations  continue to merge or consolidate 
in addition  a number of its customers have instituted source programs limiting the number of suppliers of generic pharmaceutical products carried by that customer 
as a result of these developments  heightened competition exists among generic drug producers for the business in this smaller and more selective customer base 
active pharmaceutical ingredients api the company develops  manufactures and markets api used worldwide by the generic drug industry and branded pharmaceutical companies 
certain of these ingredients are used in its own pharmaceutical products 
the manufacturing of these api occurs primarily in israel and germany 
api business the api business identifies api that will be critical to its pharmaceutical customers future product launches and then works closely with these customers on the development processes 
api development is focused on the synthesis of less common molecules for the us  european and other international markets 
an established position in the development and manufacture of api is increasingly important to the company as a means to be more competitive on pricing of its other product lines and to broaden its growth and profit opportunities 
the company believes it has a competitive advantage in its ability to produce difficult to develop products through its understanding of regulatory issues  patents  and chemistry 
because of the difficulty in developing these products and the related regulatory challenges  the lead time to market a product can be long 
the company s ability to continue to develop and market new products subject to lower levels of competition is key to driving profitability in the api business 
the api business sells to customers who face similar regulatory oversight as the company s own rx pharmaceutical business 
as a result  the api business is dependent on these customers ability to obtain proper product approvals and maintain regulatory compliance with the fda  the federal trade commission ftc  and the us drug enforcement administration dea  as well as several foreign  state and local agencies in localities in which the company s products are sold 
api customers depend on high quality supply and regulatory support  and therefore the company continues its focus on rigorous quality assurance  quality control and regulatory compliance as part of its strategic positioning 
the company s quality system is designed to comply with the regulatory requirements of the fda  the european medicines agency and the australian therapeutic goods administration 
the company is regularly inspected by various regulatory authorities and customers 
the company places a high priority on responding to client needs and requirements from project initiation through final production 
it offers support throughout the development stage  preparation of drug master files dmf and assistance 
table of contents throughout the approval process 
the api segment is supported by sales offices in the us and israel and sales agents in various other countries 
the company currently manufactures and markets to generic and branded pharmaceutical companies worldwide the following api products ammonium lactate midazolam base cetirizine dihydrochloride midazolam maleate cilostazol mometasone furoate donepezil hydrochloride modafinil exemestane moxonidine fenofibrate pentoxifylline flumazenil rocuronium bromide fluticasone propionate temozolomide gemcitabine terbinafine hydrochloride granisetron hydrochloride tosylate halobetasol tramadol hydrochloride lamotrigine zonisamide new product introductions during fiscal  the company launched several new api  including modafinil and granisetron 
net sales related to new products were approximately  for fiscal an api product is considered new if it was added to the company s product lines or sold to a new geographic area with different regulatory authorities within months prior to the end of the period for which net sales are being measured 
competition the api segment operates in a highly competitive  price sensitive market in which the company s customers continue to consolidate and or vertically integrate  thereby creating a smaller customer base 
since other manufacturers of api typically do not offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as the company s api segment  the segment competes on a product by product basis with a number of different competitors 
the company s api business is subject to increased price competition from other manufacturers of api located mostly in india  china and europe 
such competition may result in loss of api clients and or decreased profitability in this business segment 
however  the company believes that its regulatory position  market reputation  client relationships and ability to manufacture difficult to develop api provide it with a favorable competitive position 
other the other category includes two operating segments israel consumer products and israel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products 
both of these segments primarily serve the israeli market 
the israel consumer products segment consists of cosmetics  toiletries  bar soaps and detergents generally sold under the company s brand names careline  neca and natural formula 
the israel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products segment includes the marketing and manufacturing of branded prescription drugs under long term exclusive licenses and the importation of pharmaceutical  diagnostics and other medical products into israel based on exclusive agreements with the manufacturers 
neither of these operating segments individually meets the quantitative thresholds required to be a reportable segment 
the company s other category operates in competitive markets 
these markets are primarily based in israel but are also subject to competition from large multi national companies looking to expand their position in the local israeli market 
in most instances  these companies are significantly larger than the company on a global basis with greater financial resources and product lines 
the company also has several significant product supply agreements with outside vendors 
as a result  the company s competitive position is dependent on its ability to maintain these agreements 
the company believes that its competitive advantages consist of its historical knowledge of the local markets and strong local brand recognition 

table of contents information applicable to all reportable segments research and development research and development are key components of the company s business strategy and  while managed centrally on a global basis  are performed in various locations in the us and abroad 
development for the consumer healthcare markets focuses on products comparable in formulation  quality and effectiveness to existing national brand otc products and rx to otc switch products 
development of generic prescription drugs  primarily for the us market  is focused on complex formulations  many of which require costly clinical endpoint trials 
development of api for the global market also focuses on complex products with high barriers to entry 
while the company conducts a significant amount of its own research and development  it also enters into strategic alliance agreements to obtain the rights to manufacture and or distribute new products 
research and development spending during the year was  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal in addition  fiscal included a  charge for the write off of in process research and development related to the galpharm acquisition  and fiscal included an  in process research and development charge related to the glades pharmaceuticals  llc glades acquisition 
the fiscal increase was due to an increase in the number of clinical trials and additional internal development activities  as well as the inclusion of ongoing research and development expenses related to galpharm s operations during the second half of fiscal the fiscal increase over fiscal was due to a higher number of ongoing product development projects  which require more costly bioequivalence studies and clinical endpoint trials 
the company anticipates that research and development expenditures will remain at or slightly above fiscal levels  as a percentage of sales  in the foreseeable future as the company continues to cultivate its presence in the generic pharmaceutical market and to develop its internal research and development capabilities 
trademarks and patents the company owns certain trademarks and patents  however  its business as a whole is not materially dependent upon its ownership of any one trademark or patent or group of trademarks or patents 
significant customers the company believes that its primary customer base aligns with the concentration of large drug retailers in the current marketplace of the retail drug industry 
wal mart accounted for of consolidated net sales for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal should wal mart s current relationship with the company change adversely  the resulting loss of business would have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated operating results and financial position 
the company does not anticipate such a change in the foreseeable future 
in addition  while no other customer individually comprises more than of total net sales  the company does have other significant customers 
if the company s relationship with one or more of these customers changes significantly  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
manufacturing and distribution the company s primary manufacturing facilities are located in the us and israel see item a 
risk factors conditions in israel for further information 
the company also has secondary manufacturing facilities located in the uk  mexico and germany along with a joint venture located in china 
the company supplements its production capabilities with the purchase of product from outside sources 
during fiscal  the approximate average capacity utilization was and for the company s us and israeli facilities  respectively 
the capacity of some facilities may be fully utilized at certain times due to various reasons  such as the seasonality of the cough cold flu season and new product launches 
the company may utilize available capacity by contract manufacturing for other companies 
the company has logistics facilities located in the us  israel  the uk and mexico 
both contract freight and common carriers are used to deliver products 

table of contents seasonality revenues in the company s consumer healthcare segment are generally subject to the seasonal demands for cough cold flu and allergy products in its second and third fiscal quarters 
historically  the company s sales of these products have varied from year to year based in large part on the severity and length of the cough cold flu season 
while the company believes that the severity and length of the cough cold flu season will continue to impact its sales of cough cold flu and allergy products  there can be no assurance that the company s future sales of these products will necessarily follow historical patterns 
revenues for the rx pharmaceuticals  api and other segments are generally not impacted significantly by seasonal conditions 
materials sourcing high quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of the company s business units due to the nature of the products it manufactures 
raw materials and packaging components are generally available from multiple suppliers 
while the company has the ability to manufacture and supply certain api materials for the rx pharmaceuticals segment  certain components and finished goods are purchased rather than manufactured because of temporary production limitations  fda restrictions or economic and other factors 
supplies of certain raw materials  bulk tablets and components are limited  or are available from one or only a few suppliers 
historically  the company has been able to react to situations that require alternate sourcing 
should alternate sourcing be required  the nature of the fda restrictions placed on products approved through the anda or nda process could substantially lengthen the approval process for an alternate source and adversely affect financial results 
the company has good  cooperative working relationships with substantially all of its suppliers and has historically been able to capitalize on economies of scale in the purchase of materials and supplies due to its volume of purchases 
environmental the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations 
the company believes that the costs for complying with such laws and regulations will not be material to the business of the company 
the company does not have any material remediation liabilities outstanding 
in march and june of  lawsuits were filed by three separate groups against both the state of israel and the council of ramat hovav in connection with waste disposal and pollution from several companies  including the company  that have operations in the ramat hovav region of israel 
in june  the council of ramat hovav asserted third party claims in the aggregate amount of approximately  against several companies  including the company  based upon these lawsuits 
at this time  the company cannot reasonably predict the outcome or the liability  if any  associated with these claims 
government regulation the manufacturing  processing  formulation  packaging  labeling  testing  storing  distributing  advertising and sale of the company s products are subject to regulation by one or more us agencies  including the fda  the ftc  the dea and the consumer product safety commission cpsc  as well as several foreign  state and local agencies in localities in which the company s products are sold 
in addition  the company manufactures and markets certain of its products in accordance with standards set by organizations  such as the united states pharmacopoeial convention  inc usp and nsf international nsf 
the company believes that its policies  operations and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations 
us food and drug administration the fda has jurisdiction over the company s marketing of anda  nda and otc monograph drug products and the marketing of dietary supplements  which are regulated as foods 
the fda s jurisdiction extends to the manufacturing  testing  labeling  packaging  storage and distribution of these products 

table of contents otc and generic prescription pharmaceuticals 
the majority of the company s otc pharmaceuticals are regulated under the otc monograph system and subject to certain fda regulations 
under the otc monograph system  selected otc drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the submission and approval of an anda or nda prior to marketing 
the fda otc monograph system includes well known ingredients and specifies requirements for permitted indications  required warnings and precautions  allowable combinations of ingredients and dosage levels 
drug products marketed under the otc monograph system must conform to specific quality and labeling requirements  however  these products generally can be developed with fewer regulatory hurdles than those products that require the filing of an anda or nda 
it is  in general  less costly to develop and bring to market a product produced under the otc monograph system 
from time to time  adequate information may become available to the fda regarding certain anda or nda drug products that will allow the reclassification of those products as no longer requiring the approval of an anda or nda prior to marketing 
for this reason  there may be increased competition and lower profitability related to a particular product should it be reclassified to the otc monograph system 
in addition  regulations may change from time to time  requiring formulation  packaging or labeling changes for certain products 
the company also markets generic prescription drugs and other products that have switched from prescription to otc status 
these products require approval by the fda through its anda or nda processes before they can be commercialized 
based on current fda regulations  andas and ndas provide information on chemistry  manufacturing and control issues  bioequivalence  packaging and labeling 
the anda process generally requires less time and expense for fda approval than the nda process 
for approval of an anda  the company must demonstrate that the product is bioequivalent to a marketed product that has previously been approved by the fda and that the company s manufacturing process meets fda standards 
this approval process for an anda may require that bioequivalence studies be performed using a small number of subjects in a controlled clinical environment  and for certain topical generic products  demonstration of efficacy in comparative clinical studies 
approval time currently averages nineteen months from the date the anda is submitted 
changes to a product marketed under an anda or nda are governed by specific fda regulations and guidelines that define when proposed changes can be implemented and whether prior fda approval is required 
under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of the hatch waxman amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  a company submitting an nda can obtain a three year period of marketing exclusivity for an rx product or an rx to otc switch product if the company performs a clinical study that is essential to fda approval of the nda 
longer periods of exclusivity are possible for new chemical entities and orphan drugs 
these exclusivity periods could prevent other companies from obtaining approval of any andas or certain other pending applications for the product 
unless the company establishes relationships with the companies having exclusive marketing rights  or the company conducts its own clinical trials  the company s ability to market rx to otc switch products and offer its customers products comparable to the national brand products could be delayed if the three year exclusivity is granted to the initiating company 
there can be no assurance that  in the event that the company applies for fda approvals  the company will obtain the approvals to market rx or rx to otc switch products or  alternatively  that the company will be able to obtain these products from other manufacturers 
under the fda modernization act of  a manufacturer may obtain an additional six months which  under certain circumstances  may be extended to one year of exclusivity if the innovator conducts pediatric studies requested by the fda on the product 
this exclusivity will  in certain instances  delay fda approval and the sales by the company of certain anda and other products 
if the company is first to file its anda and meets certain requirements relating to the patents owned or licensed by the brand company  the company may be entitled to a day generic exclusivity for that product 
when a company submits an anda  the company is required to include a patent certification to certain patents that cover the innovator product 
if the anda applicant challenges the validity of the innovator s patent or certifies that its product does not infringe the patent  the product innovator may sue for infringement 
the legal action would not ordinarily result in material damages but could prevent the company from introducing the product if it is not successful in the legal action 
the company would  however  incur the cost of defending the legal action and that action could have the effect of triggering a statutorily mandated delay in fda approval of the anda for a period of up to months 
in addition  if exclusivity is granted to the company  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to market the product at the beginning of the exclusivity period or that the exclusivity will not be shared with other generic companies  including authorized generics 
as 
table of contents a result of events that are outside of the company s control  the company may forfeit its exclusivity 
finally  if the company is not first to file its anda  the fda may grant day exclusivity to another company  thereby effectively delaying the launch of the company s product 
the company s prescription drug products that are marketed without approved applications  most notably many of those acquired from glades  must meet certain manufacturing and labeling standards established by the fda 
the fda s policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products is stated in the fda s june compliance policy guide  titled marketed new drugs without approved ndas or andas 
under this policy  the fda has stated that it will follow a risk based approach with regard to enforcement against such unapproved products 
the fda evaluates whether to initiate enforcement action on a case by case basis  but gives higher priority to enforcement action against unapproved drugs in certain categories  such as those marketed as unapproved drugs with potential safety risks or that lack evidence of effectiveness 
the fda recognizes that certain unapproved products  based on the introduction date of their active ingredients and the lack of safety concerns  among other things  have been marketed for many years and  at this time  might not be subject to immediate enforcement action

dietary supplements 
the dietary supplement health and education act of dshea amended the federal food  drug and cosmetic act to  among other things define dietary supplements and dietary ingredients  require ingredient and nutrition labeling for dietary supplements  permit structure function statements for dietary supplements  and permit the display of certain published literature where supplements are sold 
although dietary supplements are regulated as foods  the fda is prohibited from regulating the dietary ingredients in supplements as food additives 
dshea requires that the fda be notified at least days in advance of the introduction of a dietary supplement that contains a dietary ingredient that was neither marketed prior to october  nor was present in the food supply in a form where the food had not been chemically altered 
the notification must provide information establishing that the dietary supplement containing the dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe 
dshea provides for specific nutrition labeling requirements for dietary supplements that are slightly different than those for conventional foods 
all supplements must bear a supplement facts box  which must list all of the supplement s dietary ingredients using nomenclature as specified in fda regulations 
dshea also permits dietary supplements to bear statements claiming a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease  provided the prevalence of the disease in the us is disclosed  describing the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans  characterizing the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function  and describing general well being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient 
the company is subject to a final rule published by the fda clarifying the types of statements permissible in dietary supplement labeling 
the statements cannot expressly or implicitly state that a dietary supplement has any effect on a disease  which the fda defined in the final rule 
as with foods in general  dietary supplement labeling may include a health claim  which characterizes the role of a nutrient to a disease or health related condition 
there are two types of health claims health claims authorized by fda 
table of contents regulations based on significant scientific agreement among qualified scientific experts  and qualified health claims  which may be made with a lower level of substantiation  provided that the fda does not object to the claims 
in each case  the health claim must be submitted to the fda before it may be used 
on june   the fda issued final good manufacturing practice gmp regulations specific to dietary supplements  with an effective date one year from issuance 
the company continues to invest in its dietary supplement operations to ensure compliance with the regulations 
the fda stated that it will begin inspecting the industry after the june  compliance date  at which time the agency will likely clarify expectations related to compliance 
the company will continue to monitor fda activities to ensure that its operations and quality systems are maintained in a state of compliance based on the current interpretation of the regulations 
the company cannot determine with certainty what effects the fda s future interpretations of the regulations will have on its business 
the gmp regulations and fda s future interpretations of these regulations could  among other things  require expanded documentation of the manufacturing processes for certain products or additional analytical testing for certain ingredients 
in addition  the company cannot predict whether new legislation regulating the company s activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on the company s business 
us drug enforcement administration the dea regulates certain drug products containing controlled substances  such as testosterone  and list i chemicals  such as pseudoephedrine  pursuant to the federal controlled substances act csa

recordkeeping requirements include accounting for the amount of product received  manufactured  stored and distributed 
companies handling either controlled substances or list i chemicals are also required to maintain adequate security and to report suspicious orders  thefts and significant losses 
the dea periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its rules and regulations 
failure to comply with current and future regulations of the dea could lead to a variety of sanctions  including revocation or denial of renewal of dea registrations  injunctions  or civil or criminal penalties 
the company is subject to the requirements of the csa and dea regulations in the handling of any controlled substances in schedules ii v or any of the list i chemicals identified in the csa 
specifically  the company is subject to regulation in the current manufacture and distribution of products containing pseudoephedrine  a list i chemical 
as a result of a series of amendments to the csa  the dea has imposed increased restrictions on the manufacture and distribution of pseudoephedrine products 
for example  the comprehensive methamphetamine control act of was enacted to authorize the dea to monitor transactions involving chemicals that may be used illegally in the production of methamphetamine 
the comprehensive methamphetamine control act of establishes certain registration and recordkeeping requirements for manufacturers of otc cold  allergy  asthma and diet medicines that contain ephedrine  pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine ppa 
while certain of the company s otc drug products contain pseudoephedrine  which is a common ingredient in decongestant products  the company s us products contain neither ephedrine nor ppa 
more recently  the reauthorization act of was signed into law on march  the reauthorization act of prevented the existing provisions of the patriot act from expiring and also included the combat meth act 
this law further amended the csa and provided additional requirements on the sale of pseudoephedrine products 
among the various provisions  this national legislation places certain restrictions on the purchase and sale of all products that contain ephedrine  pseudoephedrine or ppa list i chemical products 
the act imposed quotas on manufacturers that limit the amount of product that can be manufactured 
on july   the dea published an interim rule establishing regulations to implement the import and production quotas for list i chemicals  including pseudoephedrine 
the company s ability to import and manufacture pseudoephedrine products has been limited by the annual quota granted by the dea 
the csa  as amended  also imposed daily restrictions on the amount of list i chemical products a retailer may sell to a consumer grams per day and limitations on the amount of list i chemical products a consumer may purchase grams over a day period 
further  effective september   the act requires that a retail sellers place all list i chemical products behind the counter and maintain a logbook that tracks the sales of list i chemical products to

the company is subject to these state requirements as well 
centers for medicare medicaid services the centers for medicare medicaid services cms is responsible for enforcing legal requirements governing rebate agreements between the federal government and pharmaceutical manufacturers 
drug manufacturers agreements with the cms provide that the drug manufacturer will remit to each state medicaid agency  on a quarterly basis  the following rebates for generic drugs marketed under andas covered by a state medicaid program  manufacturers are required to rebate of the average manufacturer price amp net of cash discounts and certain other reductions  for products marketed under ndas  manufacturers are required to rebate the greater of of the amp net of cash discounts and certain other reductions or the difference between such amp and the best price during a specified period 
an additional rebate for products marketed under ndas is payable if the amp increases at a rate higher than inflation 
the company has such a rebate agreement in effect with the federal government 
federal and or state governments have and are expected to continue to enact measures aimed at reducing the cost of drugs to the public  including the enactment in december of medicare legislation that expanded the scope of medicare coverage for drugs starting in january management cannot predict the nature of such measures or their impact on the company s profitability 
various states have in recent years adopted supplemental drug rebate programs that are intended to provide the individual states with additional manufacturer rebates that cover patient populations that are not otherwise included in the traditional medicaid drug benefit coverage 
these supplemental rebate programs are generally designed to mimic the federal drug rebate program in terms of how the manufacturer rebates are calculated  eg  as a percent of amp 
although there are a number of supplemental rebate programs  they are insignificant in the aggregate compared to quarterly medicaid drug rebate obligations 
in july  the cms issued a final rule for the calculation of the amp  which pharmaceutical companies are required to report to the cms 
the cms intends to use this calculation to help determine reimbursements to pharmacies that dispense medicines to medicaid beneficiaries 
prior to this ruling  the cms used the average wholesaler price awp in the calculation of the reimbursement 
additionally  the cms has decided to publish manufacturer specific amp data 
in mid december  a preliminary injunction was granted  resulting in postponement of the actual implementation of the rule 
as of august   the relevant court case is still pending  resulting in a continual postponement of the rule 
on july   the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of mippa became law 
the law provides that no amp data will be made available to the public prior to october the company does not know how the new reimbursement model will affect the company s pharmacy customers or to what extent these customers will seek to pass on any increased medicaid costs to the company 
it is also unknown how mippa will impact consumers access to generic medicines  which could significantly affect the market for these products 
the company cannot predict how the sharing of manufacturer specific data may impact competition in the marketplace 
consumer product safety commission under the poison prevention packaging act  the cpsc has authority to designate that dietary supplements and pharmaceuticals require child resistant closures to help reduce the incidence of accidental poisonings

in october  the fda convened a joint meeting of the pediatric and non prescription drugs advisory committees to discuss the safety and efficacy of otc cough and cold products for use in children 
the advisory committees recommended that these products no longer be used in children under the age of six 
in january  the fda issued a public health advisory recommending against the use of otc cough and cold products in children under two years of age and announced that the fda planned to issue recommendations in the second quarter of with respect to the use of otc cough and cold products in children two through eleven years of age 
the fda has also indicated that the recommendations could include removing pediatric cough and cold products from the marketplace altogether by issuing a proposed rule recommending otc cough and cold products for children under twelve not be generally recognized as safe and effective 
the fda has not yet made any recommendation 
the company s fiscal revenues for cough and cold products marketed specifically for use in children ages two to twelve years old were approximately  sales of the company s pediatric cough and cold products could be adversely affected by such recommendations 
the fda s policy regarding the award of a day market exclusivity period to generic manufacturers who successfully challenge patents relating to specific products continues to be the subject of extensive litigation in the us the fda s current interpretation of hatch waxman is to award days of exclusivity to the first generic manufacturer who files a successful paragraph iv certification under hatch waxman challenging the patent of the branded product  regardless of whether the manufacturer was sued for patent infringement 
although the fda s interpretation may benefit some of the products in the company s pipeline  it may adversely affect others 
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of provides that the day market exclusivity period provided under hatch waxman is triggered by the commercial marketing of the product 
however  the medicare prescription drug act also contains forfeiture provisions which  if met  will deprive the first paragraph iv filer of exclusivity 
additionally  the manufacturer of the branded product may launch a generic version of its own drug  known as an authorized generic 
under certain circumstances  the company may not be able to fully exploit its day exclusivity period resulting from it being the first filer 
in september  the food and drug administration amendments act of was enacted into law 
this law gives the fda new powers to restrict medications that raise serious safety concerns 
this law requires  and provides funding for  the fda to monitor drugs after they go on the market 
in addition  this law requires companies to make public the results of many of their studies 
under this new law  the fda has the authority to require new studies  limit distribution or order label changes 
because of this law  the company s ability to bring new and current products to market could be impeded  which could have a negative material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company s prescription drug products that are marketed without approved applications  most notably many of those acquired from glades  must meet certain manufacturing and labeling standards established by the fda 
the fda s policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products is stated in the fda s june compliance policy guide  titled marketed new drugs without approved ndas or andas 
under this policy  the fda has stated that it will follow a risk based approach with regard to enforcement against such unapproved products 
the fda evaluates whether to initiate enforcement action on a case by case basis  but gives higher priority to enforcement action against unapproved drugs in certain categories  such as those marketed as unapproved drugs with potential safety risks or that lack evidence of effectiveness 
the fda recognizes that certain unapproved products  based on the introduction date of their active ingredients and the lack of safety concerns  among other things  have been marketed for many years and  at this time  might not be subject to immediate enforcement action 
the company believes that so long as it complies with applicable manufacturing and labeling standards it will be consistent with the fda s current enforcement policy 
there can be no assurance that the fda will continue this policy or not take a contrary position with any individual product or group of products 
if the fda were to do so  the company may be required to seek fda approval for these products or withdraw such products from the market 
for fiscal  the company s annual sales for such unapproved products were approximately the fda held a public meeting on november  to explore the public health benefit of creating a new behind the counter btc class of drugs 
drugs placed in this category would be available without a prescription  but only after intervention by a pharmacist

the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representations made to store brand customers or to regulatory action against the company related to the products made in that facility  including seizure  injunction or recall  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or operating results 
commercialization of new products research and development the company s future results of operations depend  to a significant degree  upon its ability to successfully commercialize additional otc and generic drugs and or innovative pharmaceuticals and api 
the company must develop  test and manufacture generic prescription products as well as prove that its generic prescription products are bioequivalent to their branded counterparts  which often requires bioequivalency studies or even more extensive clinical trials in the case of topical products 
otc drugs may require bioequivalency studies as well 
all major products must meet regulatory standards and receive regulatory approvals 
the development and commercialization process  particularly with respect to innovative products  is both time consuming and costly and involves a high degree of business risk 
products currently under development  if and when fully developed and tested  may not perform as expected  may be the subject of intellectual property challenges  necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner  if at all  and the company may not be able to successfully and profitably produce and market such products 
delays in any part of the process or the company s inability to obtain regulatory approval of its products including products developed by others to which the company has exclusive marketing rights could adversely affect operating results by restricting or delaying its introduction of new products 
even upon the successful development of a product  the company s customer s failure to launch a product could adversely affect operating results 
continuous introductions of new products and product categories are critical to the company s business 
product margins may decline over time due to the products aging life cycles  changes in consumer choice or developments in drug delivery technology 
therefore  new product introductions are necessary for maintenance of the company s current financial condition  and if the company fails to introduce new products  the effect on its financial results could be materially adverse 
the company s investment in research and development is expected to remain at or slightly above recent levels  as a percentage of sales  due to the company s ongoing broadening of its otc anda  topical generic rx and specialty api product portfolio as well as several opportunities for new products that are switching from prescription to otc status 
the ability to attract scientists proficient in emerging delivery forms and or contracting with a third party innovator in order to generate new products of this type is a critical element of the company s long term plans 
should the company fail to attract qualified employees  successfully develop products in a timely manner  or enter into reasonable agreements with third parties  long term sales growth and profit would be adversely impacted 
potential volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock has been  and could be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to  among other things  quarterly fluctuations in operating results  adverse circumstances affecting the introduction or market acceptance of new products  product recalls  failure to meet published estimates of or changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  announcements of new products or enhancements by competitors  receipt of regulatory approvals by competitors  sales of common stock by existing holders  loss of key personnel  market conditions in the industry  shortages of key product inventory components and general economic conditions 
fluctuation in quarterly results the company s quarterly operating results depend on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the severity  length and timing of the cough cold flu season  the timing of new product approvals and introductions by the company and its competitors  price competition  the magnitude and timing of research and development investments  changes in the levels of inventories maintained by the company s customers and the timing of retailer promotional programs 
accordingly  the company may be subject to significant and unanticipated quarter to quarter fluctuations 

table of contents competitive issues the markets for otc pharmaceutical  nutritional  generic pharmaceutical and api products are highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on price  quality and assortment of products  customer service  marketing support and availability of new products 
competition also comes from national brand companies and brand pharmaceutical companies 
that competition could be intensified should those companies lower prices or manufacture their own store brand or generic equivalent products 
due to the high degree of price competition  the company has not always been able to fully pass on cost increases to its customers 
the inability to pass on future cost increases  the impact of store brand competitors and the impact of national brand companies lowering prices of their products or operating in the store brand market could have a material adverse impact on financial results 
in addition  since the company sells its nutritional products through retail drug  supermarket and mass merchandise chains  it may experience increased competition in its nutritional products business through alternative channels such as health food stores  direct mail and direct sales as more consumers obtain products through these channels 
the company has evaluated  and will continue to evaluate  the products and product categories in which it does business 
future product line extensions  or deletions  could have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
selling prices of generic drugs typically decline  sometimes dramatically  as competition intensifies due to additional companies receiving approvals for a given product or brands launching authorized generics 
to the extent that the company succeeds in being the first to market a generic version of a significant product  the company s sales and profit can be substantially increased in the period following the introduction of such product and prior to a competitor s introduction of an equivalent product 
the company s ability to sustain its sales and profitability on any product over time is dependent on both the number of new competitors for such product  some of whom may be significantly larger than the company  and the timing of their approvals 
certain competitors are choosing to consolidate in the generic pharmaceutical and nutritional industries 
these consolidations may create larger companies with which the company must compete and provide further pressure on prices  development activities or customer retention 
the impact of future consolidation in the industry could have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company s api business is subject to increased competition from other manufacturers of api located in europe and developing countries  such as india and china 
such competition may result in loss of api customers and or decreased profitability in this business segment 
store brand product growth the future growth of domestic store brand products will be influenced by general economic conditions  which can influence consumers to switch to store brand products  consumer perception and acceptance of the quality of the products available  the development of new products and or product delivery forms  the market exclusivity periods awarded on rx to otc switch products and the ongoing or growing strength of the retailers brands in the market 
the company does not advertise like the national brand companies and thus is dependent on retailer promotional spending to drive sales volume and increase market share 
growth opportunities for the products in which the company currently has a significant store brand market share cough cold flu  analgesic  smoking cessation and gastrointestinal products will be driven by the ability to offer new products to existing domestic customers 
branded pharmaceutical companies may use state and federal regulatory and legislative means to limit the availability of brand equivalent products 
should store brand growth be limited by any of these factors  there could be a significant adverse impact on the operating results of the company

the recommendations by the ndac are not binding on the fda 
it is not known at this time what  if any  further action the fda or industry will take in response to recommendations of the ndac 
in fiscal  products containing phenylephrine generated revenues of approximately  certain actions by the fda  such as mandating label and packaging changes  could have an adverse effect on the operating results of the company 
dextromethorphan the company manufactures several products that contain the active ingredient dextromethorphan  which is indicated for cough suppression 
dextromethorphan has come under scrutiny because of its potential to be abused 
some states have introduced legislation that  if passed  could require restricted access to dextromethorphan in finished dosage forms 
such legislation placing age restrictions on the purchase of otc products containing dextromethorphan was passed at the local level by suffolk county  new york and by the city of jerseyville  illinois 
at least one state has passed legislation restricting the bulk sale of dextromethorphan 
similarly  on the federal level  the us house of representatives passed the dextromethorphan distribution act of  which prohibits the illicit distribution of bulk  unfinished dextromethorphan to any person other than fda registered producers of drugs and devices 
the legislation is now pending consideration by the us senate  where a companion bill has been introduced 

table of contents in october  the dextromethorphan abuse reduction act of was introduced  which would prevent teens under the age of from purchasing otc cough medicine containing dextromethorphan in finished dosages and concentrations 
legislation imposing similar age restrictions on purchases of dextromethorphan in finished dosages has also been introduced by at least one state 
it is possible that any of the states or the federal government could introduce and pass legislation imposing additional or different restrictions on the sale of dextromethorphan in finished dosage form  including but not limited to  requiring a minimum age to purchase product  limiting the amount a consumer may purchase  requiring a prescription and or placing the product in a more controlled position of sale behind the pharmacy counter of a retailer 
in fiscal  products containing dextromethorphan generated revenues of approximately  the company cannot predict whether any of the proposed legislation will be passed or  if it is passed  its impact on future revenues attributable to these products 
product issues effect of misuse and publicity the company s products are safe and effective when used in accordance with label directions 
however  certain products contain ingredients that can be  and in some cases are  used for improper purposes 
as previously discussed  pseudoephedrine and dextromethorphan are two of these ingredients  but others may exist 
increasingly  various efforts are employed by federal and state governments in an effort to curb this misuse  including the consideration of additional legislation or regulation that may result in further restrictive requirements for the manufacture or sale of products containing these ingredients 
the company cannot predict if or when any additional legislation or regulation will be approved 
if this type of additional legislation or regulation is approved  it could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company believes that growth in the nutritional products business is based largely on national media attention regarding scientific research suggesting potential health benefits from regular consumption of certain vitamin and other nutritional products 
there can be no assurance of future favorable scientific results and media attention  or the absence of unfavorable or inconsistent findings 
in the event of future unfavorable scientific results or media attention  the company s sales of nutritional products could be materially adversely impacted 
source of raw materials and supplies affordable high quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of the company s business units due to the nature of the products it manufactures 
raw materials and packaging components are generally available from multiple suppliers 
supplies of certain raw materials  bulk tablets and finished goods purchased by the company are limited  or are available from one or only a few suppliers 
in such situations  increased prices  rationing and shortages can occur 
in response to these problems the company tries to identify alternative materials or suppliers for such raw materials  bulk tablets and finished goods 
the nature of fda restrictions placed on products approved through the anda or nda process could substantially lengthen the approval process for an alternate material source 
certain material shortages and approval of alternate sources could adversely affect financial results 
the rapid increase in cost of many raw materials from inflationary forces  such as increased energy costs  and the company s ability or inability to pass on these increases to its customers  could have a material impact on the company s financial results 
in addition  raw materials purchased from third parties  including those from foreign countries  may contain counterfeit ingredients or other adulterants 
the company maintains a strict program of verification and product testing throughout the ingredient sourcing and manufacturing process to identify counterfeit ingredients  adulterants and toxic substances 
nevertheless  discovery of previously unknown problems with the raw materials or product manufacturing processes or new data suggesting an unacceptable safety risk associated therewith  could result in a voluntary or mandatory withdrawal of the contaminated product from the marketplace  either temporarily or permanently 
any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to the company  and may give rise to product liability litigation  either of which may have a material adverse effect on the operating results of the company 
legal exposure from time to time  the company and or its subsidiaries become involved in lawsuits arising from various commercial matters  including  but not limited to  competitive issues  contract issues  intellectual property matters  workers compensation  product liability  environmental remediation issues and state or federal regulatory issues 
see item legal 
table of contents proceedings 
litigation is unpredictable and can be costly 
no assurance can be made that litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations in the future 
similarly  judicial decisions in proceedings to which the company is not a party may result in the setting of legal precedent that could affect the future operation of the company s business 
in addition  the company may face environmental exposures including  for example  those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of its operations  the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated hazardous substances or wastes  and the health and safety of its employees 
while the company does not have any material remediation liabilities currently outstanding  the company may in the future face liability for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or petroleum products on  under  or in its currently or formerly owned property  or from a third party disposal facility that it may have used  without regard to whether the company knew of  or caused  the presence of the contaminants 
the actual or alleged presence of  or failure to remediate properly  these substances could have adverse effects  including  for example  substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral 
there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
tax rate implication income tax rate changes by governments and changes in the tax jurisdictions in which the company operates could influence the effective tax rates for future years 
entry into new tax jurisdictions  whether domestic or international  increases the likelihood of fluctuation 
the mix of income between tax jurisdictions in any given quarter can also significantly change the effective tax rate across quarters and years 
customer issues sales to the company s largest customer  wal mart  comprised approximately of fiscal net sales 
should wal mart s current relationship with the company change adversely  the resulting loss of business could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in addition  while no other customer individually comprises more than of total net sales  the company does have other significant customers 
if the company s relationship with one or more of these customers changes significantly  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
maintaining the supply relationships with the company s customers is critical to its success 
if the company is unable to deliver to expected customer service levels  customers may choose to assess penalties  obtain alternate sources for products  withhold new product introductions and or end the relationship with the company 
customers may limit the level of product sourcing with the company in protection of the customer s own interests 
any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
retailer consolidation could have an adverse impact on future sales growth 
if a large customer should encounter financial difficulties  the company s exposure on uncollectible receivables and unusable inventory  as well as the potential loss of future sales  could result in a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
conditions in israel the company has significant manufacturing and research and development facilities in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect the company s operations  and the company could be adversely affected by current or future hostilities involving israel or a significant recession or downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its neighboring countries 
a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel in recent years 
the level of hostilities increased significantly in july between israel and hezbollah in neighboring lebanon 
in the first quarter of fiscal  these hostilities abated significantly 
however  tensions in the region remain 
these hostilities adversely affected israel s relationship with a number of countries in the region and elsewhere  as well as its relationship with international organizations 

table of contents while none of the company s facilities in israel have been directly affected by hostile operations  there can be no assurance that a further escalation of hostilities will not impact the company s facilities 
furthermore  the company s employees in israel include members of the israeli military reserves  some of whom have been called up for active duty 
if a significant number of the company s employees in israel are called up for active duty in the military  the company s operations in israel may be materially adversely affected 
escalations of hostilities have disruptive effects on israel s economy  and any international economic sanctions against israel could further harm israel s economy 
these economic developments could have an adverse effect on the company s israel consumer products and israel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products businesses 
furthermore  certain parties with whom the company does business may decline to travel to israel  which would force the company to make alternative arrangements where necessary 
the united states department of state has at times issued an advisory regarding travel to various sections of israel 
as a result of the state department s advisories  the fda has at various times curtailed or prohibited its inspectors from traveling to israel to inspect the facilities of israeli companies  and should this occur with respect to the company s israeli facilities  the fda could withhold approval for new products intended to be produced at those facilities 
although it has not yet occurred  the political and security situation in israel may result in certain parties with whom the company has contracts claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments pursuant to force majeure provisions of those contracts 
the company could experience disruption of its manufacturing and research and development facilities due to terrorist acts or military actions 
if terrorist acts or military actions were to result in substantial damage to the company s facilities  business activities would be disrupted since  with respect to most products  the company would need to obtain prior fda approval for a change in manufacturing site 
the company s insurance may not adequately compensate it for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by the company could have a material adverse effect on its business 
some neighboring countries  as well as certain companies and organizations  continue to participate in a boycott of israeli firms and others doing business with israel or with israeli companies 
the company is also precluded from marketing its products to certain of these countries due to us and israeli regulatory restrictions 
because none of the company s revenue is currently derived from sales to these countries  the company believes that the boycott has not had a material adverse effect on its current operations 
however  continuation or extension of the boycott or implementation of additional restrictive laws  policies or practices directed towards israel or israeli businesses could have an adverse impact on the expansion of the company s business 
patent and trade dress issues the company s ability to bring new products to market is limited by certain patent  trademark and trade dress factors including  but not limited to  the existence of patents protecting brand products for the consumer healthcare  rx pharmaceuticals and api segments and the regulatory exclusivity periods awarded on products that have switched from rx to otc status 
the cost and time to develop these prescription and switch products is significantly greater than the rest of the new products that the company seeks to introduce 
moreover  the manufacture  use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry 
these lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
the company may have to defend against charges that it violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
the company s defense against charges that it infringed third party patents or proprietary rights could require the company to incur substantial expense and to divert significant effort of its technical and management personnel 
if the company is found to have infringed on the rights of others  it could lose its right to develop or manufacture some products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties 
although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements  the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the company cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be 
table of contents available to it on terms it believes to be acceptable 
as a result  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the company from manufacturing and selling a number of its products 
at times  the company may seek approval to market generic prescription products before the expiration of patents for those products  based upon its belief that such patents are invalid  unenforceable or would not be infringed by its products 
as a result  the company may face significant patent litigation 
depending upon a complex analysis of a variety of legal and commercial factors  the company may  in certain circumstances  elect to market a generic pharmaceutical product while litigation is pending  before any court decision or while an appeal of a lower court decision is pending 
this is referred to in the pharmaceutical industry as an at risk launch 
the risk involved in an at risk launch can be substantial because  if a patent holder ultimately prevails  the remedies available to such holder may include  among other things  damages measured by the profits lost by the holder  which are often significantly higher than the profits the company makes from selling the generic version of the product 
by electing to proceed in this manner  the company could face substantial damages if the final court decision is adverse to the company 
in the case where a patent holder is able to prove that the company s infringement was willful or exceptional  the definition of which is subjective  the patent holder may be awarded up to three times the amount of its actual damages 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company launched clobetasol propionate foam   the generic version of connetics now known as stiefel olux foam   at risk 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company and connetics settled the patent litigation  eliminating the at risk nature of the launch 
israel government grants and tax benefits the company has received grants for research and development from the office of the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade 
to continue to be eligible for these grants  the company s development projects must be approved by the chief scientist on a case by case basis 
if the company s development projects are not approved by the chief scientist  the company will not receive grants to fund these projects  which would increase research and development costs 
the receipt of such grants subjects the company to certain restrictions and pre approval requirements which may be conditioned by additional royalty payments with rights to transfer intellectual property and or production abroad 
the company also receives tax benefits  in particular exemptions and reductions  as a result of the approved enterprise status of certain existing operations in israel 
to be eligible for these tax benefits  the company must maintain its approved enterprise status by meeting conditions  including making specified investments in fixed assets located in israel and investing additional equity in itself and its israeli subsidiaries and by meeting projections provided to the regulatory agencies 
if the company fails to meet these conditions in the future  the tax benefits would be canceled  and the company could be required to refund the tax benefits already received 
these tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at any level 
if such benefits are reduced or eliminated in the future  the company s results of operations will be adversely impacted 
manufacturing facilities the company s us operations are concentrated in allegan  michigan  greenville  south carolina and the bronx  new york 
approximately of the company s revenues are related to these manufacturing facilities 
the company has concentrated manufacturing facilities in israel  which comprise approximately of the company s revenues 
a significant disruption resulting from  but not limited to  fire  tornado  storm  material supply  insufficient quality  or flu pandemic at any of the company s facilities could impair its ability to develop  produce and or ship products on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position and operating results 
protection of intellectual property rights the company s success with certain of its products depends  in part  on its ability to protect and defend its intellectual property rights 
if the company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property  competitors may manufacture and market similar products 
the company has been issued patents covering certain of its products  and has filed  and expects to continue to file  patent applications seeking to protect newly developed technologies and products in various countries  including the us any existing or future patents issued to or licensed by the company may not provide it with any significant competitive advantages for its products or may even be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by competitors 
in addition  such patent rights may not prevent the company s competitors from developing  using or commercializing non infringing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to its products 

table of contents the company also relies on trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation that it seeks to protect  in part by confidentiality agreements with licensees  suppliers  employees and consultants 
if these agreements are breached  the company may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements 
furthermore  trade secrets and proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors or  if patents are not issued with respect to products arising from research  the company may not be able to maintain the value of such intellectual property rights 
customs and trade regulation the company imports and exports products and raw materials from several jurisdictions around the world 
this process involves company subsidiaries and third parties operating in a number of jurisdictions with different customs and import export regulations 
the regulations are subject to change from time to time and the company cannot predict the nature  scope or impact of these changes upon the company s operations 
the company is subject to periodic reviews and audits by us and foreign authorities responsible for administering these regulations 
to the extent that the company is unable to successfully defend itself against an audit or review  the company may be required to pay assessments and penalties and increased duties  which may  individually or in the aggregate  negatively impact the company s gross margins and operating results 
certain of the company s facilities operate in a special purpose subzone established by the us department of commerce foreign trade zone board  which allows the company certain tax advantages on products and raw materials shipped through these facilities 
if the us department of commerce foreign trade zone board were to revoke the subzone designation or limit its use by the company  the company could be subject to increased duties  which may negatively impact the company s gross margins and operating results 
international operations the company sources certain key raw materials from foreign suppliers in countries that include  but are not limited to  canada  china  denmark  germany  india and mexico 
the company continues to increase its revenues outside the us the company s primary markets for the sale of its products outside the us are canada  germany  israel  mexico and the uk the company may have difficulty in international markets due  for example  to regulatory barriers  the necessity of adapting to new regulatory systems and problems related to markets with different cultural bases and political systems 
sales to customers outside the us and foreign raw material purchases expose the company to a number of risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  possible difficulties in enforcing agreements  longer payment cycles  longer shipping lead times  inefficient port operations  exchange rate fluctuations  difficulties obtaining export or import licenses  the imposition of withholding or other taxes  economic or political instability  embargoes  military hostilities or exchange controls 
in addition  the company cannot predict the length of the impact the beijing summer olympics may have on the supply chain processes of the company s primary and secondary suppliers located in china 
should any of these risks occur  they may have a material adverse impact on the operating results of the company 
dependence on personnel the company s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees 
key functions for the company include executive managers  operational managers  research and development scientists  information technology specialists  financial and legal specialists  regulatory professionals  quality compliance specialists and sales marketing personnel 
should the company be unable to attract or retain key qualified employees  future operating results may be adversely impacted 
goodwill and other intangibles the company tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
the company s testing in the fiscal year resulted in no impairment charges related to goodwill 

table of contents other intangible assets consist of a portfolio of individual developed product technology formulation and product rights  distribution and license agreements  customer relationships and trade names and trademarks 
for intangible assets subject to amortization  an impairment analysis is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any individual asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
any significant change in market conditions  estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairment in the period that the change becomes known 
see note g for further information regarding impairment of intangible assets 
insurance costs the company maintains insurance  including property  general and product liability  and directors and officers liability  to protect itself against potential loss exposures 
to the extent that losses occur  there could be an adverse effect on the company s financial results depending on the nature of the loss and the level of insurance coverage maintained by the company 
the company cannot predict whether deductible or retention amounts will increase or whether coverage will be reduced in the future 
from time to time  the company may reevaluate and change the types and levels of insurance coverage that it purchases 
exposure to product liability claims the company  like retailers and other distributors and manufacturers of products that are ingested  is exposed to product liability claims in the event that  among other things  the use of its products results in injury 
there is no assurance that product liability insurance will continue to be available to the company at an economically reasonable cost or at all for certain products or that the company s insurance will be adequate to cover liability that the company incurs in connection with product liability claims 
see item legal proceedings 
capital requirements and liquidity the company maintains a broad product line to function as a primary supplier for its customers 
capital investments are driven by growth  technological advancements  cost improvement and the need for manufacturing flexibility 
estimation of future capital expenditures could vary materially due to the uncertainty of these factors 
if the company fails to stay current with the latest manufacturing and packaging technology  it may be unable to competitively support the launch of new product introductions 
the company anticipates that cash  cash equivalents  investment securities  cash flows from operations and borrowings under its credit facilities will substantially fund working capital and capital expenditures 
the company has historically evaluated acquisition opportunities and anticipates that acquisition opportunities will continue to be identified and evaluated in the future 
the historical growth of sales and profits has been significantly influenced by acquisitions 
there is no assurance that future sales and profits will  or will not  be impacted by acquisition activities 
the company s current capital structure  results of operations and cash flow needs could be materially impacted by acquisitions 
interest rate implication the company incurs interest expense related to its debt obligations  including its credit facilities in the us  israel and germany 
these facilities may employ fixed interest rates  variable interest rates based on prime  libor or euribor or rates linked to consumer price indices 
interest income is related to investing cash on hand in various investments whereby the interest rate is determined on the day the investment is made 
accordingly  interest expense and income are subject to fluctuation due to the variability of interest rates and indices

table of contents item legal proceedings 
dollar amounts in thousands several arkansas counties  led by and including independence county  filed a lawsuit against the company and various manufacturers and distributors of products containing pseudoephedrine  which can be used to produce methamphetamine  an illegal drug 
through this lawsuit  the plaintiff counties sought to recoup as damages some of the expenses they have incurred to combat methamphetamine use and addiction 
they also sought punitive damages  disgorgement of profits and attorneys fees 
on february   the court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed this case with prejudice 
the plaintiffs have appealed that decision 
while the company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against it if the appeal of the dismissal is successful  the company cannot predict whether this issue will have a material impact on its results of operations 
in march and june of  lawsuits were filed by three separate groups against both the state of israel and the council of ramat hovav in connection with waste disposal and pollution from several companies  including the company  that have operations in the ramat hovav region of israel 
in june  the council of ramat hovav asserted third party claims in the aggregate amount of approximately  against several companies  including the company  based upon these lawsuits 
at this time  the company cannot reasonably predict the outcome or the liability  if any  associated with these claims 
in addition to the foregoing discussion  the company has pending certain other legal actions and claims incurred in the normal course of business 
the company believes that it has meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and or is covered by insurance and is actively pursuing the defense thereof 
the company believes the resolution of all of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations as reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
however  depending on the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits  the company s future results of operations or cash flow could be materially impacted in a particular period

income taxes the company s effective income tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates  special tax benefits and tax planning opportunities available to the company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
tax laws are complex 
table of contents and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities

changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
goodwill allocated to the consumer healthcare segment is tested annually for impairment in the second quarter of the fiscal year 
with the acquisition of galpharm in the consumer healthcare segment in the third quarter of fiscal  goodwill associated with this acquisition will be included in the next annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal the goodwill allocated to the api and rx pharmaceuticals segments is tested for impairment annually in the third quarter of the fiscal year

other intangible assets other intangible assets consist of a portfolio of individual developed product technology formulation and product rights  distribution and license agreements  customer relationships and trade names and trademarks 
the assets categorized as developed product technology formulation and product rights  as well as distribution and license agreements  are amortized over their estimated useful economic lives using the straight line method 
an accelerated method of amortization is used for customer relationships 
certain trade names and trademarks are determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not subject to amortization 
the company  however  reviews them for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that any individual asset might be impaired  and adjusts it as necessary 
for intangible assets subject to amortization  an impairment analysis is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any individual asset may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
during the second half of fiscal  additional competition entered the marketplace  exerting significant pressure on a certain product for which the company holds a developed product formulation intangible asset

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks due to changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of interest income earned on its investment of cash on hand and interest expense on borrowings used to finance acquisitions and working capital requirements 
as of june   the company had invested cash  cash equivalents and current portion of investment securities of  and short and long term debt  net of restricted cash  of  the company enters into certain derivative financial instruments  when available on a cost effective basis  to hedge its underlying economic exposure  related to the management of interest rate risk 
because of the use of certain derivative financial instruments and the significant amount of fixed rate debt  the company believes that a significant fluctuation in interest rates in the near future will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
these instruments are managed on a consolidated basis to efficiently net exposures and thus take advantage of any natural offsets 
derivative financial instruments are not used for speculative purposes 
gains and losses on hedging transactions are offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
foreign exchange risk the company has operations in the uk  israel  germany and mexico 
these operations transact business in their local currency and foreign currencies  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
a significant portion of the company s israeli operations make sales in foreign currencies  primarily us dollars and euros  while incurring costs in their local currency 
due to sales and cost structures  certain segments experience a negative impact as a result of the changes in exchange rates while other segments experience a positive impact related to foreign currency exchange 
the company estimates an additional ten percent devaluation of the us dollar relative to the other foreign currencies it transacts business in would have decreased operating income of its foreign operating units by approximately  for fiscal this sensitivity analysis has inherent limitations 
the analysis disregards the possibility that rates of multiple foreign currencies will not always move in the same direction relative to the value of the us dollar over time 
in addition  the company enters into certain purchase commitments for materials which  although denominated in us dollars  are linked to foreign currency valuations 
these commitments generally contain a range for which the price of materials may fluctuate over time given the value of a foreign currency 
the translation of the assets and liabilities of the company s international operations is made using their foreign exchange rates as of the end of the year 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are disclosed in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets until a sale or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the international subsidiary takes place 
in certain markets  the company could recognize a significant gain or loss related to unrealized cumulative translation adjustments if it were to exit the market and liquidate its net investment 
as of june   the cumulative net currency translation adjustments increased shareholders equity by  foreign currency transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than an operating unit s functional currency 
for fiscal  net transaction losses were  the company monitors and strives to manage risk related to foreign currency exchange 
exposures that cannot be naturally offset within a local entity to an immaterial amount are often hedged with foreign currency derivatives or netted with offsetting exposures at other entities 
however  the company cannot predict future changes in foreign currency exposure 
unfavorable fluctuations could adversely impact earnings
