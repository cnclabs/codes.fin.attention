table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we currently own and operate restaurants located in states 
we offer freshly prepared food  personalized service  and a contemporary ambiance that create a satisfying yet affordable dining experience that we believe exceeds many traditional casual dining restaurants with whom we compete 
our high volume upscale casual restaurants feature a diverse selection of mainstream american dishes as well as a variety of appetizers and entrees with an international influence  including an extensive selection of sushi items 
our menu items are freshly prepared and incorporate over signature sauces and dressings that we make from scratch  creating broad based appeal for the lifestyle and taste trends of a diverse group of guests 
our menu is standardized for all of our restaurants allowing us to deliver consistent quality meals 
we believe that our offerings and generous portions  combined with an average check during of approximately per guest  offers our guests an attractive price value proposition 
we continue to follow a disciplined growth plan focused largely on expanding our presence in new markets 
over the last two years  we have funded our development of new restaurants primarily from the proceeds of our initial public offering  our private offering of common stock completed during november  and cash flows from operations 
we opened four restaurants during in austin  texas  troy  michigan  stamford  connecticut  and baton rouge  louisiana 
we plan to open an additional five restaurants during  which will expand our presence in both new and existing markets 
we target our restaurants to achieve an average annual unit volume of million following months of operations 
we believe our typical new restaurants experience gradually increasing unit volumes as guests begin to discover our concept and we begin to generate market awareness 
our restaurants are also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
sales in most of our restaurants typically are higher during the spring and summer months and winter holiday season 
we experience various trends in our operating cost structure 
cost of sales  labor  occupancy  and other operating expenses for our restaurants open at least months generally trend consistent with restaurant sales  and we analyze those costs as a percentage of restaurant sales 
we anticipate that our new restaurants will take approximately six months to achieve operating efficiencies as a result of challenges typically associated with new restaurants  including lack of market recognition and the need to hire and sufficiently train employees  as well as other factors 
we expect cost of sales and labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales to be higher when we open a new restaurant  but decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as the restaurant matures and as the restaurant management and employees become more efficient operating that unit 
as a result  the volume and timing of newly opened restaurants has had  and is expected to continue to have  an impact on costs of sales  labor  occupancy  restaurant operating expenses  and preopening expenses 
the majority of our general and administrative costs are fixed costs 
we expect our general and administrative spending to increase as we add corporate personnel and infrastructure to support our growth and comply with the requirements associated with being a public company 
however  we expect our general and administrative costs to decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as we leverage these investments and realize the benefits of higher sales volumes 

table of contents key measures we use to evaluate our company key measures we use to evaluate and assess our business include the following number of restaurant openings 
number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period 
same store sales growth 
same store sales growth reflects the periodic change in restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base 
in calculating same store sales growth  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for more than months 
same store sales growth can be generated by an increase in guest traffic counts or by increases in the per person average check amount 
menu price changes and the mix of menu items sold can affect the per person average check amount 
average weekly sales 
average weekly sales represents the average of restaurant sales measured over consecutive monday through sunday time periods 
average unit volume 
average unit volume represents the average restaurant sales for all of our restaurants open for at least months before the beginning of the period measured 
sales per square foot 
sales per square foot represents the restaurant sales for our restaurants open for at least months  divided by the total square feet for such restaurants 
restaurant operating profit 
restaurant operating profit is defined as restaurant sales minus cost of sales  labor  occupancy  and restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating profit does not include general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  and preopening expenses 
we believe restaurant operating profit is an important component of financial results because it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant level productivity  efficiency  and performance 
we use restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales as a key metric to evaluate our restaurants financial performance compared with our competitors 
key financial definitions restaurant sales 
restaurant sales include gross food and beverage sales  net of promotions and discounts 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of food and beverage costs 
labor 
labor includes all direct and indirect labor costs incurred in operations 
occupancy 
occupancy includes all rent payments associated with the leasing of real estate  including base  percentage and straight line rent  property taxes  and common area maintenance expense 
we record tenant improvement allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense over the initial term of the lease 
restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating expenses consist of all other restaurant level operating costs  the major components of which are utilities  credit card fees  advertising  supplies  marketing  repair and maintenance  and other expenses 
other operating expenses contain both variable and fixed components 
general and administrative 
general and administrative includes all corporate and administrative functions that support operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include management and staff salaries  bonuses  stock based compensation and related employee benefits  travel  information systems  human resources  training  corporate rent  professional and consulting fees  and corporate insurance costs 
preopening expense 
preopening expense consists of costs incurred prior to opening a new restaurant and is comprised principally of manager salaries and relocation  payroll and related training costs for new employees  including practice and rehearsal of service activities  and rent expense incurred from the date we obtain possession of the property until opening 
we expense restaurant preopening expenses as incurred  and we expect preopening expenses to be similar for each new restaurant opening  which typically commence six months prior to a restaurant opening 

table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense consists of the depreciation of property and equipment and gains and losses on disposal of assets 
interest income 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and investments 
interest expense 
interest expense includes the cost of servicing our debt obligations  net of capitalized interest

restaurant operating profit is not a financial measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to income loss from operations 
restaurant operating profit may not be comparable to the same or similarly titled measures computed by other companies

year ended december  compared with year ended december  restaurant sales 
restaurant sales increased by million  or to million during from million during primarily as a result of million in additional revenue associated with the opening of nine restaurants since april  and a million or increase in same store sales 
the increase in comparable restaurant sales benefited from an effective menu price increase of approximately 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by over million or  to million during from million during cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to in from during cost of sales in was positively affected by lower seafood costs and a reduction in the number of operating weeks contributed by restaurants open less than six months resulting from the timing of new restaurant openings 
cost of sales are typically higher during the first six months of operations for our new restaurants versus our mature restaurants as management teams become accustomed to predicting  managing  and servicing the sales volumes we expect at our restaurants 
additionally  beginning in the second half of  we started the implementation of a new automated food cost and inventory management system in our restaurants 
the initiative is scheduled to be completed in july of and is expected to result in more efficient management of our food costs 
labor 
labor costs for our restaurants increased by million  or to million during from million during labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to during from during this increase was primarily due to higher average wages to attract and retain qualified restaurant managers and the impact of federal and state minimum wage increases that were implemented during 
table of contents occupancy 
occupancy expense increased by million  or to million during from million during occupancy expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to in from in the decrease reflects increased leverage of these costs from higher sales volume 
restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating expenses increased by million  or to million during from million during restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to during from during  primarily as a result of increased expenditures for advertising and marketing initiatives and higher repair and maintenance expenses as a percentage of sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or to million during from million during the million increase was primarily attributable to planned investments in corporate personnel to support our growth  in addition to the write off of costs for architectural drawings and certain contractor costs 
these costs were partially offset by a decrease of million in stock based compensation expense and million of separation costs incurred in related to the retirement of our former president and chief executive officer 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were during compared to during preopening expense 
preopening expense decreased by million  or to million during from million during the decrease in preopening expense is primarily attributed to the opening of four restaurants during as compared to five restaurants during our preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the number of restaurants opened  the timing of new restaurant openings  the location of the restaurants  the rental costs of the restaurants  and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or to million during from million during the increase was primarily the result of the additional depreciation and amortization on four restaurants opened during and a full year of depreciation and amortization on five restaurants that opened during depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to during from during the percentage increase is primarily due to higher average capital expenditures for two restaurants opened in the chicago market during interest income 
interest income decreased by million to million during from million during primarily due to lower average investment balances as a result of the sale of investments to fund new restaurant development 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million to million in compared to million during the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to higher capitalized interest incurred in the construction of our new restaurants and lower average debt balances 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes increased by million to million during compared to million during during  we incurred million of federal and state tax expense  including a non cash charge of million related to stock options exercised during which required the recording of additional tax expense under statement of financial accounting standard no

during  we did not incur a federal income tax liability and recorded state income taxes of million for states in which no state net operating loss carryforwards exist 

table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  restaurant sales 
restaurant sales increased by million  or  to million during from million during primarily as a result of a million increase associated with the opening of two restaurants during the second half of and five restaurants during  and a million increase related to a increase in same store sales 
the comparable restaurant sales also benefited from an effective menu price increase of approximately in addition to an increase in customer traffic 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to during from during the slight reduction in cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales was primarily the result of economies of scale in the purchasing of food and beverage products as well as more favorable meat pricing 
additionally  in our new restaurants  cost of sales will typically be higher during the first six months of operations versus our mature restaurants  as management teams become accustomed to predicting  managing and servicing sales volumes we expect at our restaurants 
labor 
labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to during from during this increase was primarily due to higher average wages to attract and retain qualified restaurant managers and the impact of opening five new restaurants during as compared to two new restaurants during as our new restaurants generally experience higher labor costs for approximately six months after opening as the restaurant management and employees become more efficient operating that unit 
occupancy

restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to during from during  primarily as a result of increased expenditures for advertising and marketing initiatives  higher costs for utilities and additional staff training costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million during from million during the million increase was primarily attributable to million related to the planned addition of corporate personnel and infrastructure to support our growth strategy and a full year of reporting and compliance costs associated with being a public company  a net increase of million in stock based compensation expense attributed to the expensing of stock options  and million of separation costs related to the retirement of our former president and chief executive officer 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were during compared to during preopening expense 
preopening expense increased million to million during from million during the increase in preopening expense primarily relates to the opening of five restaurants during as compared to two restaurants during  in addition to million of preopening expense for restaurants scheduled to open in the first half of preopening expense in also includes million of rent expense required to be expensed under fsp fas no 
 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
prior to  rental costs incurred during a construction period were capitalized and amortized over the initial term of the lease agreement 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million during from million during the prior year 
the increase was primarily the result of the additional depreciation and amortization on five restaurants opened in and two restaurants opened during the third quarter of  as well as accelerated depreciation related to the retrofit of our existing restaurants with a new point of sale system 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to during from during the percentage increase is primarily due to higher average capital expenditures for two restaurants opened in the chicago market during and lower than average sales volumes at our sugar land  texas restaurant as well as the accelerated depreciation related to the point of sale system discussed above 
interest income 
interest income of million during increased million from primarily due to interest income earned from the investment of proceeds from our initial public offering completed in august 
table of contents interest expense 
interest expense was million during compared to million during the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to a million non cash charge to interest expense recorded during from the conversion of our convertible subordinated promissory note  in addition to a reduction of interest expense on this note that was converted into common stock prior to our initial public offering 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was  during compared to  during during  we did not incur a federal income tax liability and during  we recorded a federal income tax liability of  related to federal alternative minimum taxes 
during and  we recorded state income taxes of  and  respectively  for states in which no state net operating loss carryforwards exist 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of  available to offset future taxable income  subject to certain limitations 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the following timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  restaurant operating costs and preopening costs for our newly opened restaurants  which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter  labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel  profitability of our restaurants  especially in new markets  increases and decreases in comparable restaurant sales  impairment of long lived assets and any loss on restaurant closures  changes in borrowings and interest rates  general economic conditions  weather conditions or natural disasters  timing of certain holidays  new or revised regulatory requirements and accounting pronouncements  changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions  and fluctuations in commodity prices 
our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the spring and summer months and winter holiday season 
consequently  our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and the factors discussed above 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease 
in the future  operating results may fall below the expectations of our investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock would likely decrease

during the last two years  we have funded our development of new restaurants primarily from the proceeds of our initial public offering  cash flows from operations  and the sale of equity securities in a private placement transaction 
we intend to continue developing new restaurants in markets where we believe our concept will have broad appeal and attractive restaurant level economics 
similar to many restaurant chains  we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations 
we believe that our operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
we are typically required to expend cash to perform site related work and to construct and equip our restaurants 
the average investment cost for our restaurants depends upon the type of lease entered into  the amount of tenant improvement allowance we receive from landlords  and whether we assume responsibility for the construction of the building 
we expect the cash investment cost of our prototype restaurant to be approximately million  net of landlord tenant improvement allowances between million and million  and excluding preopening expenses of approximately million 
we expect these costs will vary from one market to another based on real estate values  zoning regulations  labor markets and other variables 
we also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants and to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures 

table of contents our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations  and the type of leases entered into 
during november  we completed the sale of  shares of common stock to accredited institutional investors in a private placement transaction 
we filed a registration statement covering the resale of the shares of common stock sold in the private placement 
we received net proceeds of approximately million which we intend to use to fund new restaurant development and for general corporate purposes 
based upon our current growth plan  we believe that our current cash flow and our cash and investment balance coupled with our anticipated cash flow generated from operations and the proceeds from our recently completed private placement will provide sufficient funds to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements into in the event that additional capital is required  we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity or debt financing 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to current shareholders 
we cannot ensure that such capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
equipment loans as of december   we had five equipment term loans with lenders  each collateralized by restaurant equipment 
the outstanding principal balance under these loans aggregated million 
the loans bear interest at rates ranging from to and require monthly principal and interest payments aggregating approximately  the loans mature between june and june the loans also require us to maintain certain financial covenants calculated at the end of each calendar year  and we were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of december  cash flows the following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash during the periods presented 
year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million and exceeded our net loss by million due principally to the effect of depreciation and amortization  an increase in the deferred rent liability and the effect of non cash stock based compensation 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million from million during to million during principally due to a million change resulting from the timing of vendor payments and a million difference in deferred rent partially offset by a reduction in our net loss by million 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million principally due to the amortization of deferred rent  depreciation and amortization  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and non cash stock based compensation  partially offset by our net loss of million  an increase in receivables primarily relating to tenant improvement allowances and an increase in other current assets 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million primarily due to depreciation and amortization  amortization of deferred rent  collections of tenant improvement allowances  and non cash compensation expenses  partially offset by our net loss of million and payments of accounts payable 
investing activities 
we fund the development and construction of our new restaurants primarily with cash and short term investments 
net cash used in investing activities was million during which consisted primarily of million in expenditures for leasehold improvements and restaurant equipment principally to construct new restaurants 
net cash used in investing activities was million during  reflecting million for the funding of construction in progress and the purchase of property and equipment  the majority of which related to our five restaurant openings in and planned restaurant openings in investing activities during also include net proceeds of million from the sale of investments to fund this construction 
net cash used in investing activities was million during of which million was used to purchase investments and million primarily relates to expenditures for our two restaurants opened in 
table of contents financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million during consisting primarily of million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in a private placement transaction  million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock as a result of the exercise of stock options and warrants  as well as shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by million of principal payments on equipment loans 
net cash used in financing activities was million during principally consisting of million of principal payments on our equipments loans  partially offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan

in addition  the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of  the timing of which is uncertain 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 
we have evaluated and determined that we do not have any purchase obligations as defined in the sec final rule no 
 disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and also require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and we select useful lives that reflect the actual economic lives of the underlying assets 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the related lease term 
we calculate depreciation using the straight line method for financial statement purposes 
we capitalize improvements and expense repairs and maintenance costs as incurred 
we are often required to exercise judgment in our decision whether to capitalize an asset or expense an expenditure that is for maintenance and repairs 
our judgments may produce materially different amounts of repair and maintenance or depreciation expense if different assumptions were used 

table of contents we periodically perform asset impairment analysis of property and equipment related to our restaurant locations 
we perform these tests when we experience a triggering event such as a major change in a location s operating environment  or other event that might impact our ability to recover our asset investment 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
also  we have a policy of reviewing the financial operations of our restaurant locations on at least a quarterly basis 
locations that do not meet expectations are identified and monitored closely throughout the year  including the review of actual results and analyzing of budgets for the ensuing year 
if we deem that a location s results will continue to be below expectations  we will analyze alternatives for its continued operation 
at that time  we will perform an asset impairment test 
if we determine that the asset s carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we will record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its fair value 
calculation of fair value requires significant estimates and judgments which could vary significantly based on our assumptions 
upon an event such as a formal decision for abandonment restaurant closure  we may record additional impairment charges 
any carryover basis of assets will be depreciated over the respective remaining useful lives 
leasing activities we lease all of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  we evaluate each property and classify the lease as an operating or capital lease in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
we exercise significant judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the restaurant as well as the discount rate used to discount the minimum future lease payments 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can reasonably be assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which typically begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally include construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater rent expensed during the rent holiday period 
we record contingent rent expense based on a percentage of restaurant sales  which exceeds minimum base rent  over the periods the liability is incurred 
the contingent rent expense is recorded prior to achievement of specified sales levels if achievement of such amounts is considered probable and estimable 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
these estimates consider  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provisions 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future income tax consequences of carryforwards and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets that are deemed more likely than not to be realized in the near term 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we establish valuation allowances to offset any deferred tax asset recorded 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate  tax planning strategies  and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may be unable to implement certain tax planning strategies or adjust these estimates in future periods 
as we update our estimates  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations or financial position  or we could reduce our valuation allowances which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model and is affected by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the actual and projected employee and director stock option exercise behavior 
the use of an option pricing model also requires the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends  and expected term 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a peer group of companies over the expected life of the option as we do not have enough history trading as a public company to calculate our own stock price volatility 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
sfas r also requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise these estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures based on our expectation of future experience while considering our historical experience 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of earnings 
we are also required to establish deferred tax assets for expense relating to options that would be expected to generate a tax deduction under their original terms 
the recoverability of such assets are dependent upon the actual deduction that may be available at exercise and can further be impaired by either the expiration of the option or an overall valuation reserve on deferred tax assets 
we believe the estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances  however  should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences  there could be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
impact of recently issued standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard expands required disclosures about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurement 
sfas  as originally issued  was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  on december   the fasb issued fasb staff position fas b  which deferred the effective date of sfas for one year  as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
we will adopt sfas no 
as it relates to financial assets and liabilities beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investments we are exposed to market risk primarily from fluctuations in interest rates on our short term investments 
these investments are classified as available for sale securities and are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
we held approximately million in available for sale securities as of december  changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
for  the average interest rate earned on our investments was approximately 
a hypothetical basis point decline in the interest rate earned on our investments would decrease our interest income by approximately million 
included in our investments as of december   are million in aaa rated auction rate securities which are backed by student loans  the majority of which are guaranteed by the federal government under the federal family education loans program 
in addition to the federal government guarantee on such student loans  many of the securities also have separate insurance policies guaranteeing both the principal and accrued interest 
auction rate securities are structured to provide liquidity through an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined calendar intervals  generally every days 
this mechanism allows existing investors to either rollover their holdings  whereby they will continue to own their respective securities  or liquidate their holdings by selling such securities at par 
however  as has been recently reported in the financial press  recent uncertainties in the credit market have adversely affected the auction market for these types of securities 
as a result of the current conditions in the credit markets  auctions for million of the total million in auction rate securities held as of december  were unsuccessful in february and march of the failure of auctions is broad based and not limited to those securities held by us 
the auction rate securities continue to pay interest at rates that are generally higher than the current market rate  and there has been no change in the rating of these securities to date 
typically the fair value of auction rate securities approximates par value due to the frequent resets through the auction rate process 
however  the liquidity and fair value of these investments may be impacted primarily by the uncertainty of the credit markets and exposure to the financial condition of bond insurance companies 
as a result of the unsuccessful auctions  these securities are currently illiquid and furthermore  we cannot predict how long they will remain illiquid 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate the market for these securities to determine if impairment of the carrying value of the securities has occurred due to illiquidity or for other reasons 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate or if normal market conditions do not improve in the near future  we may be required to recognize an impairment charge against earnings and or reflect these securities as long term investments on our balance sheet for the period ending march  or thereafter 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of commodity costs  labor costs  and construction costs 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality  and other factors outside our control 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks 
we also believe that we have the ability to increase certain menu prices in response to food commodity price increases 
our labor costs are impacted by increases in the minimum wage rate as many of our employees are paid labor rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
we have exposure to rising construction costs  which may impact our actual cost to develop new restaurants 
although the cost of restaurant construction will not impact significantly the operating results of the restaurant  it would impact the return on investment for such restaurant 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor  and construction costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years
