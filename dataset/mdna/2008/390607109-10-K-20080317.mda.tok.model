item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview great lakes is the largest provider of dredging services in the united states 
dredging generally involves the enhancement or preservation of navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil  sand or rock 
the us dredging market consists of three primary types of work capital  beach nourishment and maintenance  in which sectors the company has experienced an average combined bid market share in the us of over the past three years 
the company s largest domestic dredging customer is the us army corps of engineers the corps  which has responsibility for federally funded projects related to navigation and flood control 
in  approximately of the company s dredging revenues were earned from contracts with federal government agencies  including the corps as well as other federal entities such as the us coast guard and us navy 
this year s percentage of revenues from the federal government is down from the three year average of due primarily to the corps funding issues 
see business current status of domestic dredging market 
the company tracks the annual federal appropriation process  to the extent that information is available  to assist it in planning for and managing its domestic operations 
based on this information in recent years  the company has continued to diversify its revenue base  taking on additional work overseas  as well as private work domestically 
the international operations provide additional customer diversification  which has been beneficial during the downturn in the domestic economy 
the company is the only us dredging contractor with significant international operations  which represented approximately of its dredging revenues compared with the three year average of 
the company also owns of the capital stock of north american site developers  inc nasdi  a demolition service provider located in the boston  massachusetts area 
nasdi s principal services consist of interior and exterior demolition of commercial and industrial buildings  salvage and recycling of related materials  and removal of hazardous substances and materials 
one nasdi management stockholder retains a non voting interest in nasdi  which is reflected as the minority interest in the company s consolidated financial statements 
since the acquisition of nasdi in  the company has operated in two reportable segments dredging and demolition 
contract revenues most of the company s dredging contracts are obtained through competitive bidding on terms specified by the party inviting the bid 
the nature of the specified services dictates the type of equipment  material and labor involved  all of which affect the cost of performing the contract and the price that dredging contractors will bid 
the company recognizes contract revenues under the percentage of completion method  based on the company s engineering estimates of the physical percentage completed for dredging projects and using a cost to cost approach for demolition projects 
for dredging projects  costs of contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the gross profit percentage expected to be achieved upon ultimate completion of each dredging project 
for demolition projects  contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the estimated gross profit percentage 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
claims for additional compensation due the company are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled 
billings on contracts are generally submitted after verification with the customers of physical progress and may not match the timing of revenue recognition 
the difference between amounts billed and recognized as revenue is reflected in the balance sheet as either contract revenues in excess of billings or billings in excess of contract revenues 
modifications may be negotiated when a change from the original contract specifications is encountered  necessitating a change in project scope or performance methodology and or material disposal 
significant expenditures incurred incidental to major contracts are deferred and recognized as costs of contracts based on contract performance over the duration of the related project 
these expenditures are reported as prepaid expenses 
costs and expenses the components of costs of contract revenues include labor  equipment including depreciation  lease expense  insurance  fuel  maintenance and supplies  subcontracts  rentals  and project overhead 
hourly labor is generally hired on a project by project basis 
costs of contract revenues vary significantly depending on the type and location of work performed and assets utilized 
generally  capital projects have the highest margins due to the complexity of the projects  while beach nourishment projects have the most volatile margins because they are most often exposed to weather conditions 
the company s cost structure includes significant annual fixed costs  including depreciation  maintenance  insurance and long term equipment rentals  averaging approximately to of total costs of contract revenues over the last three years 
during the year  both equipment utilization and the timing of fixed cost expenditures fluctuate significantly 
accordingly  the company allocates these fixed equipment costs to interim periods in proportion to revenues recognized over the year to better match revenues and expenses 
specifically  at each interim reporting date the company compares actual revenues earned to date on its dredging contracts to expected annual fixed equipment costs 
in the fourth quarter  any over and under allocated fixed equipment costs are recognized such that the expense for the year equals actual fixed equipment costs 
as a result of this methodology  the recorded expense in any interim period may be higher or lower than the actual fixed equipment costs incurred 
utilization current and projected utilization of equipment is an important factor the company considers in managing its dredging business 
the company does not measure utilization of equipment in the aggregate  however  it tracks utilization by dredge and other major pieces of equipment 
the ability to maintain high levels of equipment utilization impacts the company s profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the financial statements 
the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or an estimation process that can affect the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company  as well as the related footnote disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results 
percentage of completion method of revenue recognition the company s contract revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method  which is by its nature based on an estimation process 
for dredging projects  the company uses engineering estimates of the physical percentage of completion 
for demolition projects  the company uses estimates of remaining costs to complete to determine project percent complete 
in preparing its estimates  the company draws on its extensive experience in the dredging and demolition businesses and its database of historical information to assure that its estimates are as accurate as possible  given current circumstances 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
claims for additional compensation are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled 
cost and profit estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis to reflect changes in expected project performance 
impairment of goodwill sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
great lakes believes that this estimate is a critical accounting estimate because i goodwill is a material asset and ii the impact of an impairment could be material to the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of july each year 
the company assesses the fair value of the reporting unit using the income approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth trends  forecasted revenues and expenses  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
the estimates are based on assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
at december   goodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed by mdp on december  goodwill was allocated between the company s two reporting units  dredging and demolition at that time based on the value assigned to each unit 
at december  and  dredging goodwill was and million  respectively and demolition goodwill was million 
goodwill was tested for impairment during the third quarter of  at which time it was concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
the company s policy is to recognize an impairment charge when an asset s carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value 
the amount of the charge is the difference between the asset s book value and fair market value 
the company s policy is to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows using financial projections that require the exercise of significant judgment on the part of management 
changes in these projections may expose the company to future impairment charges 
if a triggering event requiring impairment testing occurs  the company would evaluate the remaining useful lives of these assets to determine whether the lives are still appropriate 
self insurance reserves the company self insures estimated costs associated with workers compensation claims  hull and equipment liability and general business liabilities  up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that the company will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
in determining its estimates  the company incorporates historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in determination of such reserves 
income taxes the company calculates its current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
the company s estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
management believes it has adequately provided for uncertain tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
however  the company s future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire

continued softness in the domestic bid market and increased maintenance costs offset the company s efforts to increase margins 
while the bid market of million did not match the bid market of million  the company s market share in exceeded its market share of 
as a result  the company took on a greater amount of work in in comparison to the previous year 
included in the work were four large capital projects  two in the ports of new york new jersey  and one each in boston and oregon 
these projects will provide continuous work for certain dredges into in  foreign operations generated of dredging revenues compared with in the middle east market continues to be very robust  with many opportunities for the company s services  particularly in bahrain 
in  the company is positioning more equipment to the region as it represents the best opportunity to maximize utilization for these vessels given the current weak domestic bid market 
the company s demolition segment generated a large increase in revenue year over year as it has taken on a number of large projects in the activity in the boston area continues to provide ongoing opportunities for nasdi to take on numerous small projects and a number of larger projects in the range of million to million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from revenues of million in the improvement was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign dredging million and domestic demolition million activities 
gross profit margin for the year of was relatively unchanged from the prior year due to a significant increase in maintenance expense 
dredging revenues were million in  an increase of million  or  over revenue of million 
dredging gross profit margin was in which is consistent with gross profit margin of 
domestic capital dredging revenue of million in was relatively unchanged from revenue of million 
capital work in was driven by a deepening project in brunswick  ga and lng work in golden pass  texas 
nevertheless  capital revenue was below historical levels as continued funding issues at the corps delayed bidding for capital work 
however  the company started five capital projects in the second half of the that should provide significant revenue throughout the company s revenue from beach nourishment projects of million was down slightly from revenue of million 
the beach bid market in of million was above last year s market of million 
in  of the work put out to bid was funded through state and local authorities  a trend that has sustained the beach market over the last few years as the corps funding issues have negatively impacted federal spending on beach nourishment 
great lakes completed nearly million of beach work in for non federally funded customers 
revenues from maintenance projects in were million  an increase of million  or from million in the maintenance bid market of million was below the record bid market of million  but in line with previous years bid markets as the corps continues to put maintenance work out to bid despite struggling to fund capital and beach work 
revenues from foreign dredging operations in totaled million  an increase of million  or  from revenues of million 
this performance reflects the company s increased commitment of resources internationally 
the company continued work on several large land reclamation projects in bahrain throughout the year as well as a port deepening project in the bahamas 
nasdi s demolition revenue was million  an increase of million  or  over revenues of million 
this increase was driven by three large projects won in however  a significant portion of the work on these projects included subcontract work  consequently the margins on these projects were not as high as nasdi typically generates 
as a result  gross profit margin attributable to the demolition segment was in which is down compared to in this work is expected to lead to additional direct demolition activity that is expected to yield more typical margins 
for the year ended december   consolidated general and administrative expenses totaled million  compared with million in  an increase of million  or 
expenses include an aggregate of million related to the company s secondary offering of stock  expenses associated with being a publicly traded company  provision for a doubtful receivable and costs related to the company s efforts to resolve its personal injury lawsuits in texas 
the remainder of the increase in relates to normal increases associated with the company s increase in revenue 
operating income for the dredging segment was million  up million  or  versus operating income of million due to the increase in revenue and stable contract margins 
demolition operating income was million  an increase of million  or  from operating income of million  again driven by the increase in revenue 
the company s net interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared with million in this million decrease was the result of lower debt levels in as well as a decrease in interest rates resulting from the company s new revolving credit facility 
in addition  the company had an unrealized gain of million on the mark to market of its interest rate swap  compared to a million gain last year 
the company incurred income tax expense of million compared with million in this million increase is a result of greater operating income and a higher effective tax rate year over year 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  during  the company increased its federal deferred tax rate to 
this increase in the deferred tax rate resulted in deferred tax expense of million which increased the effective tax rate by 
in  the company decreased its state deferred tax rate resulting in a deferred tax benefit of million which decreased the effective tax rate by 
for the year ended december   the company generated net income of million compared to million for the year ended december  the improvement in net income was driven by increased operating income as well as a decrease in interest expense in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  were million  up slightly from revenues of million 
while fleet utilization between years was similar  the increase in gross margin to from a year ago was a result of the improvement in both domestic and foreign project margins despite the negative impact of the increases in the company s self insured claims reserves recorded during the year 
dredging revenues were million in  an increase of million over revenue 
detail of the mix of revenue is below 
dredging gross profit was in compared to in  again  this is due to improvement in margins on both domestic and foreign projects 
domestic capital dredging revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in capital work was down over last year due to the continued funding issues at the corps that delayed capital work put out for bid 
however  privately funded work  including the developing market for new lng terminals  has helped offset this decline in the federally funded capital market 
the company completed its first lng terminal project in freeport  texas in the third quarter of with total revenue of million  and began another lng terminal project in golden pass  texas with projected total revenue in excess of million 
approximately one third of this project was completed in the fourth quarter of and the remainder of the work will be completed in the company s revenue from beach nourishment projects of million was on par with revenue of million in the bid market experienced a reduction in beach nourishment work during to million following the record market of million 
however  the beach nourishment market remained robust and was above the beach market in years prior to fortunately  while the corps funding has been minimal  more beach communities have taken over the responsibility for developing funding sources to meet their beach nourishment needs and are putting out their own projects for bid 
great lakes completed over million of beach work in for non federally funded customers 
revenues from maintenance projects in of million were similar to revenues of million 
the maintenance bid market was above the prior five year historical annual average markets as the corps continues to put maintenance work out to bid despite struggling to fund capital work 
revenues from foreign dredging operations in totaled million  which is an increase of million  or from revenues of million  as the company performed work on a large land reclamation project in bahrain throughout the year and mobilized and began dredging on the three year  multi phase diyaar project also in bahrain 
nasdi s demolition revenue was million  on par with revenues of million 
the demolition sector has consistently generated this level over the past several years 
the activity in the boston area continues to provide constant opportunities for nasdi to take on a good number of small projects and a number of larger projects in the range of to million 
the gross profit margin attributable to nasdi s demolition business was  down compared to in this decrease was the result of more interior demolition projects 
interior demolition requires more labor and precision processes than exterior work and has more volatile margins 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses totaled million  compared to million in includes the impact of a non cash write down of goodwill and intangible assets of million  related to the company s demolition segment 
in the third quarter of each year the company performs its annual test for impairment of goodwill 
in  great lakes renegotiated its compensation arrangements with the president of its demolition segment 
as a result of the increased incentive compensation to be paid in the future  great lakes revised future performance expectations for this segment  and wrote down the value of goodwill and certain intangible assets related to the segment by million  which impacted the quarter 
there was no impairment in expense included million of expense for legal fees and other costs related to the provision of documents in response to the department of justice s subpoena  a significant decrease compared to expense of million 
this decrease is a result of the minimal activity related to this matter throughout this matter is discussed further in legal proceedings 
operating income for the dredging segment was million  up million over operating income of million 
this is due to improved margins on projects performed throughout year 
demolition operating income was million in compared to operating loss of million in the increase in for nasdi was a result of the negative impact from the impairment of goodwill and intangibles of million discussed above in the company s net interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million in included in interest expense is million in deferred financing fees that were written off as a result of the aldabra merger 
additionally  a decrease in the company s average debt outstanding offset an increase in the underlying interest rates 
as a result of its net income  the company incurred income tax expense of million 
in  the company had an income tax benefit of million 
tax expense in resulted from the return to profitability but was offset by an increase in work performed in foreign locations that have more favorable tax rates 
for the year ended december   the company generated net income of million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  generated net income as a result of improved margins on work performed throughout the year and the net loss included the million non cash write down of goodwill and intangible assets 
bidding activity and backlog the company s contract backlog represents management s estimate of the revenues that it currently expects will be realized under the portion of the contracts remaining to be performed 
such estimates are subject to fluctuations based upon the amount of material actually dredged as well as factors affecting the time required to complete the job 
in addition  because a substantial portion of the company s backlog relates to government contracts  the company s backlog can be canceled at any time without penalty  however  the company can generally recover the actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation 
in addition  the company s backlog may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based upon the type and size of the projects it is awarded from the bid market 
a quarterly increase or decrease of the company s backlog does not necessarily result in an improvement or a deterioration of its business 
consequently  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future results 
the company s backlog includes only those projects for which the company has an executed contract 
dredging 
the domestic dredging bid market for the year totaled just over million  a decline from the market of million 
although the market was down from the previous year  the company won of this market resulting in an amount of work that exceeded what the company took on in additionally  the company s market share was significantly higher then its historical average over the last five years of due in part to the exit of a domestic competitor in as described in business competitors 
the capital and beach bid markets were up slightly over the prior year  but the maintenance market was down from a record year 
included in the work the company won were four large capital projects  two in the ports of new york new jersey and one each in boston and oregon that will provide continuous work for certain dredges into no significant lng starts came in as various potential projects continue to work through permitting and sourcing issues 
the company s dredging backlog at december  totaled million  which compares to million at december  approximately million  or  of the company s year end dredging backlog of million consists of domestic capital dredging work  a substantial portion of which is expected to be performed in this level of capital backlog is significantly higher then at the previous year end as five federal deep port projects were awarded in with a total value of million and great lakes won four of those five 
as a result  the majority of the capital work in backlog at the end of is federally funded 
while this is more deep port work than came out in or  the individual size of these traditionally large projects has decreased 
in  the corps began bidding projects that include a smaller base amount of work which can be more easily funded  plus options for the remainder of the project that can be awarded as more funds are released 
as a result  the dredging industry faces the difficulty of committing equipment and forecasting utilization for a scope of work that may never be awarded 
this challenge is most prevalent with the larger capital projects which are being awarded in smaller sections over a longer period of time 
however  there is recent evidence that congress is softening on the issues of allowing the corps to use continuing contracts language and redirect funding from one dredging project to another 
this may decrease the need for the base plus option strategy and provide flexibility for the corps to get more work out in the future 
beach backlog was million at the end of  a decrease from million at the end of the beach nourishment bid market totaled million  which is slightly below the average bid market over the last five years of million  primarily due to the record bid market of million in the company won million  or  of this work 
as has been the trend over the last two years  state and local sources are funding beach work directly  accounting for of the beach market 
however  in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  a number of both federally and privately funded projects were postponed until later in  primarily as the result of permitting delays 
maintenance backlog was million at the end of  a decrease from million at the end of the maintenance bid market was million  which was below the average maintenance market over the last five years of million 
maintenance projects are typically shorter in duration and can be won and performed in the same quarter  so the decrease in backlog is not necessarily indicative of a slow maintenance market in the company s share of the market was up from its historical share of over the last three years 
foreign capital backlog decreased to million at the end of from million at the end of as the company had completed approximately one third of the first phase of the diyaar land reclamation project in bahrain that it won in it is expected that the remainder of this phase will take approximately two more years to complete 
the second phase  which can be awarded by the customer any time prior to november of  would result in revenue of approximately million to great lakes when awarded and will take an additional two years to complete 
there are also two other projects in bahrain that are currently in backlog 
demolition 
the company s demolition backlog at december  totaled million  a increase from backlog of million at december  as previously mentioned  the company added three large contracts during the year for demolition and site work  which will continue through the first quarter of in addition  there are numerous small projects and several larger projects  ranging in value from million to million  in backlog 
mdp acquisition and aldabra transaction the company accounted for the acquisition of great lakes dredge dock corporation by mdp as a purchase  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
this resulted in a new basis of accounting  effective december   at which point the company reflected its assets and liabilities at fair value 
the excess of the purchase price paid over the net assets acquired was allocated primarily to property and equipment and other intangible assets  and deferred taxes related thereto  with the remaining excess recorded as goodwill 
each year the company performs its annual assessment for the impairment of goodwill and intangibles 
as previously noted  in a million non cash write down was recorded related to the goodwill and intangibles in the demolition business that had been established as a result of the purchase price allocation 
there was no impairment in or the company s operations were previously held by gldd acquisitions corp 
acquisitions corp  which merged with a subsidiary of aldabra acquisition corporation aldabra on december  aldabra was a blank check company formed for the purpose of raising capital through an initial public offering with the intent to use the proceeds to merge with a business to build long term value 
under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger entered into on june   the stockholders of acquisitions corp 
received  shares of aldabra stock in exchange for all common and preferred stock outstanding 
aldabra then merged into an indirect wholly owned subsidiary and  in connection with this holding company merger  the stockholders of aldabra  including the former acquisitions corp 
stockholders  received stock in a new holding company that was subsequently renamed great lakes dredge dock corporation 
liquidity and capital resources historical the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash flow generated from operations and borrowings under its senior credit facility see note  long term debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s principal uses of cash are to meet debt service requirements  finance its capital expenditures  provide working capital and meet other general corporate purposes 
the company s net cash flows from operating activities for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in results primarily from an increased investment in working capital due to expanded foreign dredging operations and demolition activities 
additionally  the company made investments in pipe inventory in to improve mobilization times between domestic projects and to meet the requirements of the increase in overseas operations 
the increase in is a result of improved net income as well as the temporary reduction in working capital as a result of favorable contract billing terms 
the company s net cash flows used in investing activities for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
investing activities included significant vessel acquisitions made by the company

no gain was recognized on this transaction 
in addition  the company exercised early buy out options related to the operating leases for the dredges texas and pontchartrain and two scows for a total of million 
during the company also invested million in the construction of an auxiliary vessel for the dredge florida which should be completed by the middle of capital spending for items exclusive of the dredge acquisitions  lease buyouts and the construction of the auxiliary vessel for the florida was million

in nasdi s spending also increased from prior years related to leasehold improvements for a new office and garage facility on which million was spent 
the company s net cash flows from financing activities for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million

cash flow also includes million in revolver borrowings for working capital and equipment acquisitions as well as the repayment of million in long term debt in connection with the refinancing of the company s credit agreement described below 
in  the company s tranche b term loan facility of approximately million was repaid with the proceeds received upon the merger with aldabra 
the decrease primarily relates to scheduled payments under the company s senior equipment term loan and voluntary prepayments made under the company s senior bank facility term loan b of million 
prospective on june   the company entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement with lasalle bank national association  as administrative agent and issuing lender  various other financial institutions as lenders and certain subsidiaries of the company as loan parties
