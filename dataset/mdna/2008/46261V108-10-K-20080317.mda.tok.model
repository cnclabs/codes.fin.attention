item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview we deliver simple  secure and manageable enterprise mobility services  maximizing the productivity of workers as they move between office  home and remote locations 
our policy management services close the gaps in protecting computers  network assets  user identities and data whenever users connect over the internet 
our connectivity services utilize the ipass global virtual network  a unified network of over dial up  wireless  and broadband providers in over countries 
overview of in  we continued to experience a decline in revenues derived from our traditional dial up business as dial up revenue decreased to million in as compared to million in and million in this decrease was offset in part by revenues generated from fees and usage of our broadband service 
however  we continued to add new customers during  including from the forbes global  bringing our total forbes global customers to as of december  as we continued to increase the number of broadband access points during the year  increasing our global broadband footprint was a priority for us in we ended with approximately  wi fi and wired hotspots worldwide  approximately  of which were wi fi hotspots and approximately  of which were wired hotspots 
this enabled our customers to remotely access their corporate networks from more locations  at higher speeds and contributed to a million or increase in broadband usage revenue in over going forward  we will continue to focus on delivering innovative services and solutions for our customers  increasing the number of end users of our services for both dial up and broadband access  as well as continue to increase fee revenues from device management and other fee based services 
in  we expect to see continued growth in our business 
however  our success could be limited by several factors  including the timely release of new products  continued market acceptance of our products and the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors 
for a further discussion of these and other risk factors  see the section below entitled risk factors 
sources of revenues we derive our revenues primarily from providing enterprise connectivity services through our virtual network 
we sell these services directly  as well as indirectly through our channel partners 
we bill substantially all customers on a time basis for usage based on negotiated rates 
we bill the remaining customers based on a fixed charge per active user per month with additional charges for excess time 
substantially all enterprise customers commit to a one to three year contract term 
most of our contracts with enterprise customers contain minimum usage levels 
we bill customers for minimum commitments when actual usage is less than their monthly minimum commitment amount 
the difference between the minimum commitment and actual usage is recognized as fee revenue based on our estimate of cash that will ultimately be collected related to the minimum commitment 
our usage based revenues  which consists of dial up and broadband usage  represented  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have incurred expenses to expand our broadband coverage and are seeking to generate additional revenues from our broadband wired and wireless coverage 
revenues from usage of our broadband services were  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also provide customers with deployment services and technical support throughout the term of the contract 
we typically charge fees for these services on a one time or annual basis  depending on the service provided and the nature of the relationship 
in addition  we also offer customers additional services for which we generally bill on a monthly basis 
with the acquisition of mobile automation  inc in october  we also began generating license and maintenance revenue through software licensing agreements 
revenues generated from license and maintenance fees  together with revenues generated from deployment services and technical support  represented approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
recent acquisitions in february  we acquired all the outstanding shares of goremote  a provider of managed virtual business network services for approximately million in cash 
this acquisition allows us to expand our product offering to include goremote s managed broadband services for branch offices and teleworkers 
in  we acquired all the outstanding shares of mobile automation and safew for approximately million in cash 
mobile automation created a solution to help enterprise it departments protect and manage their remote and mobile devices such as computers and personal data assistants 
safew developed a dynamic device fingerprinting technology 
the technology from both of these acquisitions has been integrated into our existing products 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates are important in understanding our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition usage and services fees we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from broadband and dial up usage fees 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  service has been provided to the customer  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues during the period the services are rendered to end users based on usage at negotiated rates 
we typically require our customers to commit to minimum usage levels 
minimum usage levels can be based on an annual term  monthly term or over the term of the arrangement 
if actual usage in a given period is less than the minimum commitment  we recognize the difference between the actual usage and the minimum commitment as revenue when the fee is fixed and determinable 
we estimate the amount of the difference that will ultimately be collected because we have from time to time renegotiated minimum commitments in cases where customers have sought renegotiation of their contract for reasons such as a significant downturn in their business or where we have determined that it would be in our best interest to do so 
customers are not contractually entitled to use or otherwise receive benefit for unused service in subsequent periods 
license  maintenance and training we also license our deviceid and device management automated systems management and security software products 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and generally recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph of sop no 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
one of the critical judgments that we make is the assessment that collectability is probable 
we base our recognition of revenue on our assessment of the probability of collecting the related accounts receivable balance on a customer by customer basis 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
if we determine that collectability is not probable  we recognize revenue as cash is collected 
another critical judgment that we make involves the fixed or determinable criterion 
we consider payment terms where arrangement fees are due within three months from delivery to be normal contractual terms 
we consider payment terms beyond three months from delivery extended and not fixed or determinable 
for arrangements with extended payment terms  we recognize arrangement fee revenues when fees become due  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
maintenance revenue consists of fees for providing software updates on a when and if available basis and technical support for software products post contract support or pcs 
our maintenance rates are generally based on the percentage of license paid 
we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the agreement 
training revenue consists of fees for training services  generally provides to customer s technical teams to help support their own end users 
our training rates are generally based on a fixed rate per day and revenue is recognized as training services are delivered 
we defer payments received in advance of services until services are performed 
we provide allowances for estimated uncollectable amounts of minimum commitments billed as well as future discounts upon recognition of revenue 
accounting for income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
we establish a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we include changes in the valuation allowance in our consolidated statements of income as a provision for benefit from income taxes 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 
when we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if recovery is not likely  we would increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses to date  we have provided a full valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets at december  at each period end  we reassess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets  including net operating losses 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
to the extent the valuation allowance relates to acquired entities  the recognition of any future tax benefits would first reduce goodwill and then reduce the provision for income taxes 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted fas r using the modified prospective method  in which compensation cost was recognized based on the requirements of fas r for a all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date and b for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of fas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
fas r requires the use of judgment and estimates in performing multiple calculations 
we have estimated the expected volatility as an input into the black scholes merton valuation formula when assessing the fair value of options granted 
our estimate of volatility was based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price and the volatility of peers in our industry 
to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing stock based compensation expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate was based primarily upon historical experience of employee turnover 
to the extent we revise this estimate in the future  our stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
our estimate of expected term of options granted was derived from the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term  as described in the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
in the future  as information regarding post vesting termination becomes more accessible  we may change our method of deriving the expected term 
this change could impact the fair value of our options granted in the future 
upon adoption  we elected the alternative transition method provided in the financial accounting standards board fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of equity based compensation 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee equity based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee equity based compensation awards that are outstanding upon the implementation of sfas r 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  related to non vested stock based payments granted to employees 
we will adjust total unrecognized compensation cost for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
restructuring restructuring charges are comprised primarily of costs for abandonment of excess facilities  severance and associated employee termination costs 
we record severance costs pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
and and the excess facility costs are recorded pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that liabilities be recorded at fair value 
the difference between the fair value of the liability at the time it was recorded and the total cash liability is accreted ratably over the expected term 
this accretion is reported in the restructuring expense line on the condensed consolidated statements of operations 
we reduce costs for the abandonment of excess facilities by estimated income from the sublease of the vacated facilities 
as of december   we have estimated million in sublease income through the end of the sublease lease term in april if we are unable to sublease the facilities within the timeframe and for the rates anticipated  we may need to revise our estimates and record additional restructuring charges 
we recognized the accrual related to the facilities abandoned in connection with the acquisition of goremote as part of the purchase price allocation pursuant to emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a detailed assessment of accounts receivable for specific  as well as anticipated  uncollectible accounts receivable 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and historical payment experience 
we have an allowance for doubtful accounts of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimated the allowances required  additional allowances may be required  which would result in an increased general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
results of operations revenue december  change change in thousands  except percentages total revenue total revenue increased in as compared to  due to the addition of new customers signed over the last year and the increase in existing customers mobile broadband usage 
this was partially offset by a continued decline in dial up revenue as customers migrated from dial up to broadband as the preferred method of connecting to their corporate networks 
total revenue increased in as compared to due to offsetting factors 
revenues generated from dial up usage decreased from million in to million in this represents a decrease of million or

we anticipate that our operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months  including working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency although we currently bill our services in us dollars  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
a strengthening of the dollar could make our services less competitive in foreign markets and therefore could reduce our revenues 
we are billed by and pay substantially all of our network service providers in us dollars 
in the future  some portion of our revenues and costs may be denominated in foreign currencies 
to date  exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results 
interest rate sensitivity as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaling million 
our investment portfolio consists of cash and government securities  generally due within one to two years 
all of our instruments are classified as available for sale 
we place investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities are subject to interest rate risks 
based on our portfolio content and our ability to hold investments to maturity  we believe that  a hypothetical increase or decrease in current interest rates would not materially affect our interest income 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaling million 
our investment portfolio consisted of auction rate and money market securities  asset backed securities  corporate securities  and government securities  generally due within one to two years 
all of our instruments were classified as available for sale 
the following is a chart of the principal amounts of short term investments by expected maturity as of december  in thousands expected maturity date for par value amounts for the year ended december  as of dec 
 total cost value total fair value government agencies total our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
we consider all investments to be short term investments  which are classified in the balance sheet as current assets  because the investments can be readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity and the investments are selected for yield management purposes only and we are not committed to holding the investments until maturity 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date 
all short term investments and cash equivalents in our portfolio are classified as available for sale and are stated at fair market value  with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
we evaluate the individual securities in our portfolio that are in an unrealized loss position for other than temporary impairment 
as of december  we had six securities in unrealized loss positions  totaling less than  we do not believe that these unrealized losses constitute an other than temporary impairment
