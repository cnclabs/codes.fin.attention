item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the consolidated financial statements include wayne savings bancshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  wayne savings community bank 
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s net income is primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its loan  mortgage backed securities and investment portfolios  and its cost of funds consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company s net income also is affected by its provision for losses on loans  as well as the amount of other income  including trust fees and service charges  and general  administrative and other expense  such as salaries and employee benefits  deposit insurance premiums  occupancy and equipment costs  and income taxes 
earnings of the company also are affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
business strategy the company s current business strategy is to operate a well capitalized  profitable and community oriented bank dedicated to providing quality service and products to its customers 
the company has sought to implement this strategy in recent years by closely monitoring the needs of customers and providing personal  quality customer service  continuing the origination of a wide array of loan products in the company s market area  managing interest rate risk exposure by better matching asset and liability maturities and rates  increasing fee income  including the continuing growth of a trust department  managing asset quality  maintaining a strong retail deposit base  maintaining capital in excess of regulatory requirements  and emphasizing the commercial loan program to add high quality  higher yielding assets to the company s loan portfolio 
discussion of financial condition changes from march  to march in addition to the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
economic circumstances  the company s operations  and actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed herein but also include changes in the 
index discussion of financial condition changes from march  to march  continued economy and interest rates in the nation and the company s general market area 
the forward looking statements contained herein include  but are not limited to  those with respect to the following matters management s determination of the amount and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the effect of changes in interest rates  management s opinion as to the effects of recent accounting pronouncements on the company s consolidated financial statements  and management s opinion as to the bank s ability to maintain regulatory capital at current levels 
the company considers the allowance for loan losses and related loss provision to be a critical accounting policy 
a detailed discussion as to the application of such policy is set forth on the following pages 
at march   total assets of million decreased incrementally from the million total at march  liquid assets  consisting of cash  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits decreased by million  or  to million at march   mainly due to a reduction in federal funds sold which contributed to the total asset decline of million 
during the fiscal year ended march   loans receivable increased million  or  as the bank originated and retained million of loans and received payments of million 
rather than reinvest funds from repayments on loans in long term  fixed rate and lower yielding residential loans  the lending division has been able to originate non residential real estate loans 
the company believes that investing in shorter term adjustable rate commercial loans positions the company favorably in the current interest rate environment 
the composition of the loan portfolio continued to evolve during the fiscal year ending march   as exemplified by a net decrease of million in residential and construction mortgage loans  which were more than offset by increases in nonresidential real estate loans of million 
at march  and  the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or 
of loans and million or  respectively 
in determining the amount of loan loss analysis at any point of time  management and the board apply a systematic process of focusing on the risk of loss in the portfolio 
first  delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans are evaluated for potential impairment in carrying value 
at march   all delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans were viewed as well secured  with no material loss anticipated 
the second step in determining the allowance for loan loss entails the application of historic loss experience to individual loan types in the portfolio 
in addition to the historic loss percentage  management employs an additional risk percentage tailored to the board s and management s perception of the overall risk in the economy 
finally  to provide additional assurance regarding the validity of the commercial loan risk rating system  management engages a third party loan reviewer who provides independent validation of the bank s loan grading process 
management recorded a  provision for losses on loans for the fiscal period  an increase of  over the  recorded for fiscal year ended march   primarily due to the increase in non performing loans 
management evaluated three non performing commercial loans and elected to charge an additional  through the provision for loan losses based on updated appraisals and the evaluations of these loans 
deposits totaled million at march   a decrease of million  or  from million at march  certificates of deposit decreased by million  savings accounts decreased by million and now accounts decreased by million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in money market deposits of million 
the company continues to experience a shift in depositor preference from low cost liquid deposit accounts to higher cost money market accounts 
management exercised discipline during the period with regard to the pricing of retail certificates 
in general  management attempts to benchmark retail certificate of deposit pricing to the cost of alternate sources of funds  including federal home loan bank advances and brokered deposits 
exceptions are made to defend customer relationships with significant value to the bank while allowing rate sensitive certificate of deposit shoppers to move to other alternatives 
the local deposit market has been negatively affected by national and online competitors offering higher rates to address liquidity concerns in national markets 

index discussion of financial condition changes from march  to march  continued other short term borrowings increased by million as a result of the increase in commercial repurchase agreements growth 
additional federal home loan advances of million maturing in fiscal were borrowed as a replacement to the runoff incurred in deposits due to management s strategic pricing strategy

interest income interest income increased  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to fiscal this increase was mainly due to an increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets to from for the fiscal year ended march  the yield increase is primarily due to the shift of interest earning assets into loans 
the company has purposefully invested excess funds in shorter term securities and adjustable rate loans rather than long term fixed rate loans 
although such strategy can sacrifice short term income  it strengthens the company s interest rate position and allows the company to profitably redeploy such assets in a rising rate environment 
interest income on loans increased  or  for the year ended march   compared to fiscal  due primarily to a million  or  increase in the average balance of loans year over year  coupled with a basis point increase in the weighted average yield on loans outstanding 
the increase in the average balance of loans was primarily due to the emphasis on nonresidential loans 
interest income on securities increased  or  during fiscal  compared to fiscal  due primarily to an increase of basis points to a weighted average yield of as compared to  from the comparable period  offset by a decrease of million  or  in the average balance  caused mainly by principal repayments and maturities of million  offset by purchases of million 

index comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and continued interest income continued interest income on interest bearing deposits decreased by  or  during the fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal  due primarily to a decrease in the average balance during fiscal of million  or  coupled with a decrease in the weighted average yield of basis points to

as noted earlier  a shift in the composition of deposits from lower cost savings deposits to higher cost certificates of deposits contributed to the increase in the cost of deposits 
interest expense on other short term borrowings totaled  for the year ended march   a decrease of  from fiscal  due primarily to a decrease in the weighted average rate of basis points to for the fiscal year ended march   due to the federal reserve interest rate reductions over the past year  offset by an increase in the average balance of million

net interest income net interest income totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of  or  from the amount for fiscal the average interest rate spread decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the net interest margin remained unchanged at for both fiscal and these ratios were affected by the increase in the yield on average interest earning assets of basis points and the cost of deposits increase of basis points 
as noted earlier  a shift in the composition of deposits from lower cost savings deposits and now accounts to the higher cost of money market investor and certificates of deposit accounts contributing to the larger increase in the cost of deposits 
provision for losses on loans management recorded a  provision for losses on loans for the year ended march   an increase of  over the  recorded for the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to the increase in non performing loans as discussed above 
management evaluated three non performing commercial loans and elected to charge an additional  through the provision for loan losses based on updated appraisals and the evaluations of these loans 
the company generally has not recognized significant losses on non performing loans secured by residential mortgages

general  administrative and other expense general  administrative and other expense increased by  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to fiscal the increase in general  administrative and other expense is primarily due to an increase in employee compensation expense of  or due primarily to employee merit increases from year to year and severance expense due to a restructuring of operations 
franchise tax expense increased by  or  due to a tax return amendment causing a reduction in expense of  in fiscal an increase of  or  in other operating expense was primarily attributable to a  increase in accounting fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley regulation  as the company elected to outsource its internal controls assessment in preparation for an audit of internal controls  coupled with online banking expense increase of  due to increased usage 
federal income taxes the federal income tax expense was  for the year ended march   reflecting a decrease of  from fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from a  decrease in pre tax income

the ohio franchise expense reduction of  was due to a tax return amendment and the treasury buybacks in prior years 
net interest income was reduced by  mainly due to the runoff of the lower interest earning savings and now accounts and the growth of higher earning money market investor and certificates of deposit accounts

the yield increase is primarily due to the federal reserve raising the federal funds rate basis points over the past year 
these rate increases have beneficially affected the yields earned on the company s investment securities and interest bearing deposits 
the company has purposefully invested excess funds in shorter term securities and adjustable rate loans rather than long term fixed rate loans

these decreases were partially offset by an increase in other service fees  charges and other operating income of  or  and trust income of  the decline in gain on sale of loans is primarily due to a significant reduction in origination volume  amplified by management s decision during fiscal to retain certain fixed rate mortgage loans to facilitate growth in the portfolio 
general  administrative and other expense general  administrative and other expense decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to fiscal the decrease in general  administrative and other expense was primarily due to a reduction in employee compensation expense of  or  due to employee attrition coupled with management s initiative to enhance the bank s sales culture  eliminating several positions

while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank manages the pricing of deposits to maintain a desired level of deposits and cost of funds 
in addition  the bank invests excess funds in federal funds and other short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
federal funds sold and other liquid assets outstanding at march   and  amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
for additional information about cash flows from the company s operating  financing and investing activities  see the statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
a major portion of the bank s liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of operating  investing and financing activities 
the primary sources of cash are net income  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from deposits and advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb  and sales of securities 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if the bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate funds internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank  which provide an additional source of funds 
at march   the company had million in outstanding advances from the fhlb 
at march   management believes the company has additional borrowing capacity from the fhlb totaling million based on the bank s one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the bank has the ability to pledge 
index investments and mortgage backed securities which would allow the bank the ability to borrow a total of million 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at march  payments due by period less more than than year years years years total in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations advances from the federal home loan bank certificates of deposit maturities amount of commitments expiring per period commitments to originate loans letters of credit credit card overdraft lines of credit home equity commercial lines of credit one to four family and multi family loans total contractual obligations impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management interest rate sensitivity analysis the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that interest earning assets reprice at a different time than interest bearing liabilities 
as part of their effort to monitor and manage interest rate risk  the bank uses the net portfolio value npv methodology adopted by the ots as part of its interest rate sensitivity regulations 
the application of npv methodology illustrates certain aspects of the bank s interest rate risk 
generally  npv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning and other assets and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the npv  which would result from a theoretical change in market interest rates 

index asset and liability management interest rate sensitivity analysis continued presented below  as of march  and  is an analysis of the bank s interest rate risk as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained  and basis point basis point equals 
increases and a and basis point decrease in market interest rates 
due to the current interest rate environment  the changes in npv are not estimated for a decrease of basis points 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the npv approach 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayment on loans and mortgage backed securities and early withdrawal levels from certificates of deposit would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in making the risk calculations 
as of march  net portfolio value change in net portfolio value as of pv of assets interest rates basis points amount change change npv ratio change in thousands bp  bp bp   bp   bp  bp   bp  as of march  net portfolio value change in net portfolio value as of pv of assets interest rates basis points amount change change npv ratio change in thousands bp  bp bp   bp   bp  bp   bp  the company s policy in recent years had been to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk generally by better matching the maturities of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and by originating adjustable rate mortgage arm loans and other adjustable rate or short term loans  as well as by purchasing short term investments and mortgage backed securities 
however  particularly in the current interest rate and credit market environment  borrowers typically prefer fixed rate loans to arm loans 
accordingly  arm loan originations were very limited during the fiscal year ended march  the company has sought to lengthen the maturities of its deposits by promoting longer term certificates and the company was successful in lengthening the maturities of its certificate of deposit four to five year maturity by million  or 
the net effect of this continuing shift in customer preference for longer duration loans and shorter duration deposits has been to expose the company to increased interest rate risk 
the company has an asset liability management committee alco  which is responsible for reviewing the company s asset liability policies 
the committee meets and reports monthly to the board of directors on interest rate risks and trends  as well as liquidity and capital ratios and requirements 
the bank has operated within the framework of its prescribed asset liability risk ranges for each of the last three years
