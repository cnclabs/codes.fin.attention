item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan  predict  potential  believe  should and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appearing throughout our k are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily regarding our operations 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including those set forth under business item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing innovative therapies that target the molecular mechanisms that cause cancer 
with our collaborators  we are developing small molecule drugs with the goal of changing the way cancer is treated tm 
we are applying our expertise to develop and commercialize oral anticancer therapies designed to prevent cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis by inhibiting proteins that signal or support tumor growth 
by exploiting the genetic differences between cancer cells and normal cells  we aim to develop and market novel anticancer agents that minimize damage to healthy tissue 
our first commercially available product  nexavar sorafenib tablets  being developed with our collaborator  bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals inc  or bayer  is approved by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  for advanced kidney cancer and liver cancer 
nexavar is a novel  orally available kinase and angiogenesis inhibitor and is one of a new class of anticancer treatments that target signaling pathways important to the proliferation of cancer cells 
in december nexavar became the first newly approved drug for patients with advanced kidney cancer in over a decade 
subsequently  in the fourth quarter of  nexavar was approved as the first and is currently the only systemic therapy for the treatment of patients with liver cancer 
nexavar is now approved in more than countries for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer and in more than countries for the treatment of liver cancer 
with our collaborator  bayer  we are commercializing nexavar sorafenib tablets  for the treatment of patients with advanced kidney cancer and liver cancer 
nexavar has been approved and is marketed for these indications in the united states and in the european union  as well as other territories worldwide 
in the united states  bayer and onyx co promote nexavar 
outside of the united states  bayer manages all commercialization activities 
in  worldwide net sales of nexavar as recorded by bayer were million 
for the year ended december   worldwide net sales of nexavar as recorded by bayer were million 
in collaboration with bayer  we initially focused on demonstrating nexavar s ability to benefit patients suffering from a cancer for which there were no or few established therapies 
with the approval of nexavar for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer and liver cancer  the two companies have established the nexavar brand and created a global commercial oncology presence 
in order to benefit as many patients as possible  we and bayer are investigating the administration of nexavar with previously approved anticancer therapeutics in more common cancers  with the objective of enhancing the anti tumor activity of existing therapies through combination with nexavar 
the first pivotal trial in one of the more frequently occurring cancers is the phase trial administering nexavar in combination with standard chemotherapy for patients with non small cell lung cancer 
although this trial was stopped because an independent dmc analysis concluded that it did not meet its primary end point of improved overall survival  we continue to have other trials in non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
we and bayer are also planning a broad clinical program in breast cancer  as well as other tumor types 
we and bayer are developing and marketing nexavar under our collaboration and co promotion agreements 
we fund of the development costs for nexavar worldwide  excluding japan 
with bayer  we co promote nexavar in the united states and share equally in any profits or losses 
outside of the united states  excluding japan  bayer has exclusive marketing rights and we share profits equally 
in japan  bayer funds all product development  and we will receive a royalty on any sales 
our agreement with bayer also provides that we receive creditable milestone based payments totaling million  all of which have been received 
these payments are repayable by us to bayer from a portion of our share of any quarterly collaboration profits and royalties after deducting certain contractually agreed upon expenditures 
as of december    of this amount was paid back to bayer based on the profitability of the three months ended september  we have had significant losses since inception 
our ability to achieve continued and sustainable profitability is uncertain and is dependant on a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the level of patient demand for nexavar  the ability of bayer s distribution network to process and ship product on a timely basis  investments in sales and marketing efforts to support the sales of nexavar  bayer and our investments in the research and development of nexavar  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  and expenditures we may incur to acquire additional products 
our operating results will likely fluctuate from fiscal quarter to fiscal quarter and from year to year  and are difficult to predict 
since inception  we have relied on public and private financings  combined with milestone payments from our collaborators to fund our operations and may continue to do so in future periods 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our development efforts  the results of the nexavar clinical trials  the marketing of nexavar as a treatment for patients in approved indications  our dependence on collaborative parties  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
for a discussion of these and some of the other risks and uncertainties affecting our business  see item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we consider certain accounting policies related to net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business  stock based compensation and research and development expenses to be critical policies 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
significant estimates used in included assumptions used in the determination of stock based compensation related to stock options granted 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations  because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business relates to our collaboration with bayer for the development and marketing of nexavar 
it consists of our share of the pretax collaboration profit loss generated from our collaboration agreement with bayer net of the reimbursement of our research and development and marketing expenses related to nexavar 
under the collaboration  bayer recognizes all revenue from the sale of nexavar worldwide 
the net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business is  in effect  the net amount due to or received from bayer to balance the companies economics under the nexavar collaboration 
under the terms of the collaboration  the companies share all research and development  marketing and non united states sales expenses  excluding japan 
some of the revenue and expenses recorded to derive the net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business during the period presented are estimates of both parties and are subject to further adjustment based on each party s final review should actual results differ materially from these estimates 
if we underestimate activity levels associated with the collaboration of nexavar at a given point in time  we could be required to record significant additional expenses in future periods 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the statement of financial accounting standards  or fas  no 
r  share based payment  fas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payments made to employees and directors including employee stock option awards and employee stock purchases made under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  based on estimated fair value 
we previously applied the provisions of accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under fas  accounting for stock based compensation  or fas we adopted fas r using the modified prospective transition method beginning january  accordingly  during the year ended december   we recorded stock based compensation expense for awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january  as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under fas were in effect for expense recognition purposes adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
for these awards  the company has continued to recognize compensation expense using the accelerated amortization method under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
for stock based awards granted after january   we recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method required under fas r 
the compensation expense for these awards was recognized using a straight line amortization method 
the net loss for the years ended december  and includes stock based compensation expense of million  or per share  and million  or per share  respectively  for the adoption of fas r 
as of december   the total unrecorded stock based compensation balance for unvested shares  net of expected forfeitures  was million  which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of years 
on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects  if any  of stock based compensation expense pursuant to fas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact to the apic pool and the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of fas r 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including  but not limited to  stock price volatility and stock option exercise behavior 
we expect to continue to use the black scholes model for valuing our stock based compensation expense 
however  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense will be affected by a number of items including our stock price  the number of stock options our board of directors may grant in future periods  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation adjustments and the related tax effect 
these valuation assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price  expected life and stock option exercise behaviors 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
research and development expense in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or fas  no 
 accounting for research and development costs  research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
not all research and development costs are incurred by us 
a significant portion of our research and development expenses  approximately in  in and in  relates to our cost sharing arrangement with bayer and represents our share of the research and development costs incurred by bayer 
such amounts were recorded based on invoices and other information we receive from bayer 
when such invoices have not been received  we must estimate the amounts owed to bayer based on discussions with bayer 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
prior to  research and development costs included in our research and development line item represented our share of development expenses under the collaboration with bayer 
beginning in  consistent with the terms of our collaboration agreement  our share of bayer s nexavar product development expenses are included in net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business 
thus  in and  only our direct research and development expenses are included in the research and development line item in our statement of operations 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for clinical trials and other consulting activities  costs are expensed upon the earlier of when non refundable amounts are due or as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial sites cooperative groups and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
we monitor service provider activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could be required to record significant additional research and development expenses in future periods 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
nexavar  our only marketed product  was approved in the united states in december in accordance with our collaboration agreement with bayer  bayer recognizes all revenue from the sale of nexavar 
as such  for the years ended december  and  we reported no revenue related to nexavar 
nexavar net sales  as recorded by bayer  for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   primarily from sales in the united states and the european union 
license revenue 
license revenue was zero in   in and million in license revenue in represents  recognized for selling the rights to certain viruses from our now discontinued therapeutic virus program to shanghai sunway biotech co 
ltd and  recognized for licensing rights to certain cytopathic viruses for therapy and prophylaxis of neoplasia to dnatrix 
license revenue in represented a payment from shanghai sunway biotech co 
ltd 
in exchange for the transfer to shanghai sunway of the intellectual property and know how related to onyx we have no ongoing performance obligations under any of these agreements 
net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business 
nexavar is currently marketed and sold in the united states  several countries in the european union and other countries worldwide 
we co promote nexavar in the united states with bayer under a collaboration agreement 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  we share equally in the profits or losses of nexavar  if any  in the united states  subject only to our continued co funding of the development costs of nexavar outside of japan and our continued co promotion of nexavar in the united states 
the collaboration was created through a contractual arrangement  not through a joint venture or other legal entity 
outside of the united states  excluding japan  bayer incurs all of the sales and marketing expenditures  and onyx reimburses bayer for half of those expenditures 
in addition  for sales generated outside of the united states  excluding japan  onyx reimburses bayer a fixed percentage of sales to reimburse them for their marketing infrastructure 
research and development expenditures on a worldwide basis  excluding japan  are equally shared by both companies regardless of whether we or bayer incurs the net expense 
in japan  bayer is responsible for all development and marketing costs and we will receive a royalty on net sales of nexavar 
in the united sates  bayer provides all product distribution and all marketing support services for nexavar  including managed care  customer service  order entry and billing 
we compensate bayer for distribution expenses based on a fixed percent of gross sales of nexavar in the united states 
we reimburse bayer for half of its expenses for marketing services provided by bayer for the sale of nexavar in the united states 
we and bayer share equally in any other out of pocket marketing expenses other than expenses for sales force and medical science liaisons that we and bayer incur in connection with the marketing and promotion of nexavar in the united states 
bayer manufactures all nexavar sold and is reimbursed at an agreed transfer price per unit for the cost of goods sold in the united states 
in the united states  we contribute half of the overall number of sales force personnel required to market and promote nexavar and half of the medical science liaisons to support nexavar 
onyx and bayer each bears its own sales force and medical science liaison expenses 
these expenses are not included in the calculation of the profits or losses of the collaboration 
net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business consists of our share of the pretax collaboration profit loss generated from our collaboration with bayer net of the reimbursement of our marketing and research and development costs related to nexavar 
under the collaboration  bayer recognizes all revenue from the sale of nexavar worldwide 
collaboration profit loss is derived by calculating net sales of nexavar to third party customers and deducting cost of goods sold  distribution costs  marketing costs including without limitation  advertising and education expenses  selling and promotion expenses  marketing personnel expenses  and bayer marketing services expenses  phase clinical trial costs  allocable overhead costs and research and development costs 
the net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business is  in effect  the net amount due to or received from bayer to balance the companies economics under the nexavar collaboration 
as noted above  united states sales force and medical science liaison expenditures incurred by both companies are borne by each company separately and are not included in the calculation 
some of the revenue and expenses recorded to derive the net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business during the period presented are estimates of both parties and are subject to further adjustment based on each party s final review should actual results materially differ from these estimates 
if we underestimate activity levels associated with the collaboration of nexavar at a given point in time  the company could be required to record significant additional expense in future periods 
net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business decreases with increased nexavar net revenue and as the differential between bayer s and our shared nexavar expenses declines 
conversely  if nexavar net revenue declines or if the differential between bayer s and our shared nexavar expenses increases  net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business will increase 
when the combined collaboration is consistently profitable  that is  when nexavar net revenue is consistently greater than bayer s and our shared nexavar expenses  we expect to report a net profit from unconsolidated joint business on our revenue line 
we expect bayer s and our shared nexavar research and development expenses to increase in future periods 
we also expect bayer s and our shared cost of goods sold  distribution  selling and general administrative expense to increase as we and bayer continue to expand nexavar marketing and sales activities 
due to the uncertainty in bayer s revenue from the sale of nexavar and the relative expenses of bayer s and our shared nexavar expenses  it is not possible to predict our net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business for future periods 
for the year ended december   net expense due from unconsolidated joint business was million 
this amount is recorded as a contra expense in our statement of operations as the collaboration is not yet and may not become consistently profitable 
for the year ended december   net expense due to unconsolidated joint business was million 
the change is primarily due to an increase in nexavar revenue recognized by bayer  the reduction of combined research and development expenses  partially offset by an increase in the combined commercial expenses for nexavar 
net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business for the years ended december  and is calculated as follows year ended december  in thousands product revenue  net combined cost of goods sold  distribution  selling  general and administrative combined research and development combined collaboration loss onyx s share of collaboration loss reimbursement of onyx s direct development and marketing expenses onyx s net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  a net decrease of million  or  from million in research and development expenses include stock based compensation of million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development was due to offsetting factors 
the costs include increased costs for the startup of the phase breast trials 
offsetting this increase for a net decrease in research and development expenses is reduced costs in melanoma spending as patients come off study from this program 
we expect bayer s and our shared nexavar research and development expenses to increase in future periods as the companies develop nexavar for indications beyond advanced kidney and liver cancer 
onyx and bayer are continuing to expand their investment in the development of nexavar by conducting clinical trials to test nexavar s efficacy in more prevalent tumor types  such as lung cancer and breast cancer  in combination with already approved anti cancer therapies 
research and development expenses were million  including stock based compensation expense of million in  a net decrease of million  or  from million in we did not record expenses for employee stock based compensation prior to our adoption of fas r on january  the decrease was primarily due to the change in presentation of our statement of operations to reflect the co promotion agreement by including the net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business line item 
our share of bayer s nexavar product development expenses is included in net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business for the years ended december  and in years prior to  bayer s nexavar product development expense was included in research and development expense 
in the current presentation which began in  only our direct research and development expenses are included in the research and development line item 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential product candidates 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and includes proof of concept in animals and phase  and clinical studies in humans  each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product in development and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product 
the information in the column labeled phase of development estimated completion is only our estimate of the timing of completion of the current in process development phases based on current information 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of completion of each clinical phase of our development programs due to the risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical product candidates 
the clinical development portion of these programs may span as many as seven to ten years  and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainty of future preclinical and clinical study results and uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as marketing 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing and cost of completing a product development phase  see item a risk factors of this annual report on form k

costs in were comprised of a 
stock based compensation for consultants  b 
consulting fees for consultants retained in connection with the orderly wind down of the virus programs and preservation of related assets for potential future divestiture or commercialization  and c 
outside services related to stability testing and storage of virus product related to the programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  a net increase of million  or  from million in selling  general and administrative expenses include stock based compensation of million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to onyx incurring more of the shared marketing expenses in the united states and a planned increase in personnel in our commercial and administrative functions needed to support onyx s growth and other salary related expenses  including bonuses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  including stock based compensation expense of million  in  a net increase of million  or  from million in we did not expense employee stock based compensation prior to our adoption of fas r on january  in addition to the stock based compensation expense  the increase was primarily due to the establishment of our united states nexavar sales force in the second half of and our marketing expenses relating to the nexavar launch 
offsetting this increase is a change in accounting presentation of our statement of operations to reflect the co promotion agreement by including net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business 
our share of bayer s nexavar related marketing expenses is included in the net expense due to from unconsolidated joint business line item 
in years prior to  our share of nexavar related marketing expenses was included in the company s selling  general and administrative line item 
under the current presentation only our direct selling  general and administrative expenses are included in the selling  general and administrative expenses line item 
our direct selling  general and administrative expenses increased in due to the adoption of fas r  as well as the payroll related costs of our sales force and medical science liaisons who were hired in the second half of selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits  selling and promotions  consulting  other third party costs  corporate functional expenses and allocations for overhead and occupancy costs 
interest income 
we had interest income of million in  an increase of million from  primarily due to higher average cash balances in compared to our average cash balances in benefited from our june sale of equity securities from which we received approximately million in net cash proceeds  and our april sale of equity securities to azimuth from which we received approximately million 
we had net interest income of million in  an increase of million from  primarily due to higher interest rates in compared to in addition  our average cash balances in benefited from our october and november sale of equity securities from which we received approximately million in net cash proceeds 
interest expense was immaterial for the periods presented 
other income 
in april  we redeemed our investment in syrrx  inc as a result of the acquisition of syrrx by takeda pharmaceutical company limited 
we received cash of  as a result of the redemption  which resulted in a gain of  this amount was recorded as other income 
no similar items were recorded in other fiscal years presented 
income taxes since our inception  we have incurred operating losses and as a result have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   our net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes were approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will begin to expire in additionally  utilization of net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they can be used 
please refer to note of the accompanying financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 
related party transactions we had a loan with a former employee of which approximately  was outstanding at december  this loan bore interest at per annum 
in   of principal and interest was forgiven and the remaining loan balance of  was repaid in october in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have incurred losses  and we have relied primarily on public and private financing  combined with milestone payments we have received from our collaborators to fund our operations at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short and long term marketable securities of million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities in of million is primarily due to our public offering completed in june  which raised cash proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  of million  our april sale of equity securities to azimuth from which we received approximately million in net cash proceeds and the exercise of stock options during the twelve month period ended december  from which we received million 
this increase was partially offset by million of cash used to fund our operations 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities in of million is primarily due to net cash used in operating activities of million 
this use of cash was partially offset by net cash proceeds of from our october and november sales of equity securities under our committed equity financing  million from stock option exercises and the million milestone based advance received from bayer in january our cash used in operations was million in  million in and million in in  the cash used primarily related to the net loss of the year end 
in  the cash used primarily related to the net loss and payments of the year end and first  second and third quarter payables to bayer  our collaboration partner 
expenditures for capital equipment amounted to million in   in and  in capital expenditures were primarily for equipment to accommodate our employee growth 
we currently expect to make capital expenditures of up to million in primarily for leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment and information technology software 
in september  we secured a commitment for up to million in a common stock purchase agreement with azimuth opportunity ltd 
or azimuth 
during the two year term of the commitment  onyx may sell at its discretion registered shares of its common stock to azimuth at a discount to the market price ranging from to 
onyx will determine  at its sole discretion  the timing and amount of any sales of stock  subject to certain conditions 
under this commitment  azimuth has purchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  or million  to date  leaving million remaining on the line 
in april  azimuth purchased  shares of our common stock for a purchase price of million resulting in approximately million in net cash proceeds received by us 
in october and november  azimuth purchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock under the purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we received million in net proceeds from the sale of these shares after deducting our offering expenses 
due to the recent adverse developments in the credit markets  the company may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of its investments in auction rate securities  which are currently rated aaa and are classified as short term investments 
as of december   the company held million in auction rate securities million of which have experienced failures in the auction process 
these developments could result in the reclassification of such securities to long term investments in future periods 
we believe that  even after allowing for the reclassification of these securities to long term assets and the possible requirement to hold all such securities for an indefinite period of time  our remaining cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
we believe that our existing capital resources and interest thereon will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations beyond however  if we change our development plans  including acquiring additional product candidates or complementary businesses  we may need additional funds sooner than we expect 
in addition  we anticipate that our co development costs for the nexavar program may increase over the next several years as we continue to fund our share of the clinical development program and prepare for the potential product launches throughout the world 
while these costs are unknown at the current time  we may need to raise additional capital to continue the co funding of the program in future periods beyond we intend to seek any required additional funding through collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other available financing sources 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating leases  net of sublease income this table does not include any payments under research and development collaborations  as the amount and timing of such payments are not known 
this table also does not include the obligation to repay the million outstanding balance of creditable milestone based payments  which we received from bayer  as of december  because the repayment of this amount is contingent upon the collaboration or onyx generating profits after deducting certain contractually agreed upon expenditures 
in  we amended our existing operating lease to occupy  square feet of office space in addition to the  square feet already occupied in emeryville  california  which serves as our corporate headquarters 
the lease expires on march  when we moved into this new facility in december  we vacated our  square foot facility in richmond  california 
the lease for this facility expired in april  and we did not renew this lease 
we also have a lease for  square feet of space in a secondary facility in richmond  california which we are currently subleasing through september recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 fair value measurements  fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under united states generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
fas applies under other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  fas does not require any new fair value measurement 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of fas will have on its financial statements and cannot estimate the effect of such adoption at this time 
in february  the fasb issued fas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fas fas 
under fas  a company may elect to measure eligible financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of fas will have on its financial statements and cannot estimate the effect of such adoption at this time 
in june  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  issued issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf  which concluded that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
the capitalized amounts should be expensed as the related goods are delivered or services are performed 
such capitalized amounts should be charged to expense if expectations change such that the goods will not be delivered or services will not be delivered 
the provisions of eitf are effective for new contracts entered into during fiscal years beginning after december  the consensus may not be applied to earlier periods and early adoption is not permitted 
the company does not expect that the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations 
in december  the eitf issued issue no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
by policy  we minimize risk by placing our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer  limit duration by restricting the term and hold investments to maturity except under rare circumstances 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  auction rate notes and investment grade government and non government debt securities 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  as of december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately  the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december average average fair value interest fair value interest maturity in millions rate maturity in millions rate cash equivalents  fixed rate months months marketable securities  fixed rate months months as of december   our investment portfolio included approximately million of aaa rated investments in auction rate securities  which are classified as short term investments 
the underlying assets of these securities are student loans substantially backed by the federal government 
subsequent to december   million in auction rate securities held by the company in our investment portfolio failed  and there is no assurance that currently successful auctions on the other auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to reclassify these securities to long term assets and we will be required to reassess the carrying value of these investments 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our investments in the future  and we currently believe these securities are not significantly impaired  primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business for the next twelve months 
we did not hold any derivative instruments as of december   and we have not held derivative instruments in the past 
however  our investment policy does allow us to use derivative financial instruments for the purposes of hedging foreign currency denominated obligations 
our cash flows are denominated in united states dollars
