growth strategies we anticipate that our growth will come from disciplined expansions at selected properties and through strategic acquisitions and new developments 
we continuously review the operating performance of each of our existing properties and the feasibility of enhancing their performance through targeted capital expenditure programs 
in doing so  we assess the anticipated relative costs and benefits of the projects under consideration  the availability of cash flows and debt financing to fund capital expenditures and competitive and other relevant factors 
for example  we believe there are substantial further growth opportunities that will be realized from the expansions currently underway at our properties in st 
charles  black hawk and vicksburg and contemplated at council bluffs and east chicago 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding our ongoing and planned internal capital improvement projects 
in addition to internal expansion opportunities  we selectively evaluate external expansion opportunities to broaden our overall distribution and increase scale and diversification 
we focus on the potential acquisition of existing casino entertainment properties that can be improved through the implementation of our development and operational expertise 
we also consider new development opportunities in existing and emerging domestic and select international markets 
longer term  we may consider large development projects in major national markets 
although our preference is to own and operate each of our gaming properties  we may also evaluate expansion opportunities involving management contracts or joint ventures

competition st 
charles ameristar st 
charles competes with five other gaming operations located in the metropolitan st 
louis area 
two of these competitors are located in the state of illinois 
unlike the state of missouri  illinois does not impose a per person  per two hour session buy in limit  does not require a casino issued identification card to enter a casino and allows credit play 
however  illinois casinos are limited in the number of gaming positions allowed and are subject to a higher rate of gaming taxes than missouri casinos 
there were several major capital improvements or expansions in the st 
louis market in in december  a competitor opened an approximately million casino entertainment complex at laclede s landing in downtown st 
louis  approximately miles from ameristar st 
charles 
the complex features a mix of restaurants  conference space and a  square foot casino 
the facility includes a new room hotel and a remodeled and rebranded room hotel  both of which opened in february the existing casino in downtown st 
louis was purchased by the same company and continues to operate 
long term plans for this casino have not yet been announced

louis gaming operator is also currently in the process of completing site work for a casino development project in lemay  which is located in the southeastern portion of st 
louis county  approximately miles from our st 
charles property 
the lemay project is expected to include a million hotel and casino entertainment complex and is currently slated for opening in mid in east st 
louis  illinois  located across the mississippi river from downtown st 
louis  missouri  a gaming operator is progressing on a million  multi phased casino barge project that is a substantial upgrade to the previous facility 
the initial phase was a million expansion project that consisted of  square feet of gaming space that replaced a previously existing  square foot casino 
the new casino opened to the public in august subsequent phases that have been announced include additional restaurants and hotel rooms  a new entertainment facility and a parking garage 
estimated completion dates for these phases have not been announced 
the addition of the gaming licenses in downtown st 
louis and in lemay  as well as the upgrade to the east st 
louis facility in illinois  has resulted in increased competition for ameristar st 
charles 
the state of illinois has one dormant gaming license that it has announced it intends to reissue in the greater chicago area 
while we do not anticipate any new competition in the illinois portion of the st 
louis market  if illinois law is changed in the future to allow the operation of slot machines at the existing pari mutuel racetrack near east st 
louis  this would result in additional competition for ameristar st 
charles 
kansas city ameristar kansas city competes with three other gaming operations located in and around kansas city  missouri 
a competitor in riverside  missouri  located approximately miles from ameristar kansas city  completed a million hotel with rooms in april the kansas city market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with no competing markets within miles 
the diverse amenity base of the kansas city area casinos should serve to mitigate the impact of outer market table games play on the kansas city region 
the state of kansas has passed legislation that permits the development of two casinos in the kansas city  kansas area 
of the four kansas city  missouri casino operators  ameristar is located the farthest away from the proposed new casino development locations in kansas 
in february  the constitutionality of the state s gaming law was upheld by the shawnee county  kansas district court 
this decision is being appealed to the kansas supreme court  with a ruling expected in mid if the constitutionality of the kansas gaming law is upheld  the development of new casino gaming operations in kansas city  kansas will result in significant increased competition for ameristar kansas city 
in january  a native american casino with bingo based class ii slot machines opened in kansas city  kansas 
the casino is located approximately miles from ameristar kansas city 
the extent of any adverse impact on ameristar kansas city is currently unknown 
in january  the missouri gaming commission adopted a resolution to permit the submission of gaming license applications for a potential new riverboat casino in sugar creek  missouri  approximately seven miles from ameristar kansas city 
if the commission were to grant a gaming license for this location  the additional competition would materially adversely affect ameristar kansas city s business 
council bluffs ameristar council bluffs operates one of three gaming licenses issued for the council bluffs gaming market pursuant to an operating agreement with iowa west racing association 
the two other competitors are operated by a single company and consist of another riverboat casino and a pari mutuel racetrack casino 
in march  the competing racetrack casino opened an million expansion of its land based facility  which includes  square feet of gaming space  a  space parking garage and several other non gaming amenities 
in  the competitor re branded the casino and began to offer table games  poker and video poker in addition to slot machines 
the expansion and the additional gaming options offered by the racetrack 
table of contents casino have resulted in increased competition for ameristar council bluffs 
the council bluffs market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with the nearest competing gaming jurisdiction located approximately miles away 
in  a referendum on the statewide ballot that would have legalized video keno machines in nebraska was defeated  and another measure that would have legalized casino gaming in that state was ruled invalid by the nebraska supreme court 
in the future  the state of nebraska may again consider legalization of casino gaming which  if passed  would likely result in increased competition for ameristar council bluffs 
in december  the national indian gaming commission the nigc approved the request of the ponca tribe of nebraska to have a five acre parcel owned by the tribe in carter lake  iowa  located five miles from ameristar council bluffs  approved for the operation of gaming 
the nebraska attorney general has filed an action in federal court challenging the nigc s decision  and the iowa attorney general is reportedly contemplating a similar action 
if the tribe is allowed to conduct gaming at this location  the additional competition would adversely affect our council bluffs business 
resorts east chicago resorts east chicago currently competes with seven other gaming operations in what is called the chicagoland gaming market  which includes northwest indiana 
these competitors are located within miles of resorts east chicago 
illinois casinos are subject to higher gaming taxes and gaming position limitations in comparison to indiana casinos 
located miles from downtown chicago  illinois  resorts east chicago currently draws approximately of its customer base from illinois  with the remaining coming from northwest indiana and surrounding areas 
the operator in hammond  indiana is nearing completion of its million new vessel project  which is expected to open in september additionally  the operator in michigan city  indiana  located approximately miles from east chicago  has announced a million hotel complex expansion  which is expected to be completed in legislation regarding the possible significant expansion of gaming in illinois is currently being considered by illinois lawmakers 
if enacted  this legislation could lead to a significant level of additional competition in the chicagoland market 
vicksburg ameristar vicksburg competes with three other gaming operations located in vicksburg 
in july  one of our competitors was acquired by a privately owned company 
the new owner has made limited exterior renovations and some minor interior changes 
another competitor opened a new buffet in june several potential gaming sites still exist in or near vicksburg and from time to time potential competitors have proposed the development of additional casinos 
in early  the mississippi gaming commission granted preliminary approval for the fifth and sixth casino licenses in the vicksburg market 
one developer has proposed building a million casino facility that would include a room hotel  parking garage and other non gaming amenities 
as originally announced  construction of this project was to begin in early the announced commencement date was subsequently changed to late  but development has not yet begun  and no new date has been announced 
the second project  a million casino facility with limited amenities  is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of in addition  proposals have been made from time to time to develop other native american casinos in louisiana and mississippi  some of which could be competitive with the vicksburg market if completed

vicksburg is also subject to competition from four casinos and one slots only racetrack in shreveport and bossier city  louisiana  located approximately miles from vicksburg  as well as casinos located along the mississippi gulf coast 
black hawk ameristar black hawk competes with approximately other gaming operations located in the black hawk central city gaming market in colorado 
ameristar has the largest single gaming floor and parking garage of any casino in the black hawk market 
of the other casinos in the market  only four are considered large competitors  with over  square feet of gaming space 
ameristar s primary competitor is one of the first major casinos encountered when entering black hawk from denver via route this competitor s primary casino is connected via a skywalk to an adjacent casino the operator also owns  thereby offering increased availability of hotel rooms  parking capacity and gaming positions to customers 
the black hawk central city gaming market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with no competing markets within miles 
however  there have been several proposals for the development of a native american casino located in the denver metropolitan area 
in addition  a ballot initiative to authorize two racetrack casino operations in the denver area is being considered by the owners of the tracks 
it is unclear at this time whether this proposal will be placed on the november ballot 
both native american and racetrack gaming have been defeated in past ballot initiatives 
should additional gaming developments occur in the denver metropolitan area  the black hawk central city market would face increased competition 
jackpot the jackpot properties compete with four other hotels and motels three of which also have casinos in jackpot 
there were no major capital improvements or expansions in the jackpot market in in  a private development company proposed to construct a room casino in jackpot 
it is unclear at this time whether the developer will obtain the necessary local permit approvals and secure financing for this project 
we are not aware of any other expansion plans by existing or potential competitors in jackpot in the near future 
in the state of idaho  casinos on native american land operate video lottery terminals vlts  which are similar to slot machines 
one casino near pocatello has approximately vlts and is operated by the shoshone bannock tribes 
in  the federal court of appeals ruled that the shoshone bannock tribes could operate an unlimited number of vlts at their casino 
in addition  casino gaming on native american lands in both western washington and northeastern oregon has been in operation for several years and casinos also operate in alberta  canada

our total indebtedness increased from million as of december  to billion as of december   primarily due to additional borrowings to fund the acquisition of resorts east chicago in september as we proceed with our ongoing and planned capital improvement projects  we expect our total debt to increase further 
without any change to our senior credit facilities or obtaining subordinated debt  we may exceed the maximum permitted senior leverage ratio in we anticipate that any amendment to the senior credit facilities would result in an increase in additional costs and or fees 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important adverse consequences to our business  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions  particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited as is now the case  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  stock repurchases  dividends and general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and 
table of contents placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors 
the agreement governing our senior credit facilities contains covenants that may restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow money  pay dividends  make capital expenditures and effect a consolidation  merger or disposal of substantially all of our assets 
although the covenants in our senior credit facilities are subject to various exceptions that are intended to allow us to operate without undue restraint in certain anticipated circumstances  we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest 
in addition  our long term debt requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities 
if an event of default under our senior credit facilities occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
in addition  our senior credit facilities are secured by first priority security interests on substantially all of our real and personal property  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
if we are unable to pay all amounts declared due and payable in the event of a default  the lenders could foreclose on these assets 
we are subject to the risk of rising interest rates 
all of our borrowings under our senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 
as of december   we had billion outstanding under our senior credit facilities 
if short term interest rates rise  our interest cost will increase  which will adversely affect our net income and available cash 
many factors  some of which are beyond our control  could adversely affect our ability to successfully complete our construction and development projects as planned 
general construction risks delays and cost overruns 
construction and expansion projects for our properties entail significant risks 
these risks include shortages of materials including slot machines or other gaming equipment  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental or geological problems  weather interference  floods  hurricanes  fires or other casualty losses  unanticipated cost increases  delays or increased costs in obtaining required governmental permits and approvals  and construction period disruption to existing operations 
our anticipated costs and construction periods for construction projects are based upon budgets  conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects  consultants and contractors 
the cost of any construction project undertaken by us may vary significantly from initial expectations  and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns on any project 
if we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis  the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate cash flows from operations or other financing is available 
the completion date of any of our construction projects could also differ significantly from initial expectations for construction related or other reasons 
we cannot assure you that any project will be completed on time  if at all  or within established budgets 
significant delays or cost overruns on our construction projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in this regard  on february   we reported that the cost of our black hawk hotel project has increased by approximately million to million over our previous budget and the opening has been delayed until the second half of and that our st 
charles hotel project is now expected to be completed in may  later than originally announced 
from time to time  we may employ fast track design and construction methods in our construction and development projects 
this involves the design of future stages of construction while earlier stages of construction are underway 
although we believe the use of fast track design and construction methods may reduce the overall construction time  these methods may not always result in such reductions  often involve greater construction costs than otherwise would be incurred and may increase the risk of disputes with contractors  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
construction dependent upon available financing and cash flows from operations 
the availability of 
table of contents funds under our senior credit facilities at any time will be dependent upon  among other factors  the amount of our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda during the preceding four full fiscal quarters 
our future operating performance will be subject to financial  economic  business  competitive  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our future consolidated ebitda and the resulting availability of operating cash flows or borrowing capacity will be sufficient to allow us to undertake or complete current or future construction projects 
as a result of operating risks  including those described in this section  and other risks associated with a new venture  we cannot assure you that  once completed  any development project will increase our operating profits or operating cash flows 
worsening economic conditions or geopolitical circumstances may adversely affect our business 
we believe our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the economic slowdown and high energy prices currently being experienced in the united states  as we are dependent on discretionary spending by our customers 
any worsening of current economic conditions or further significant increases in energy prices could cause fewer people to spend money at our properties and could continue to adversely affect our revenues 
other geopolitical events  such as terrorism or the threat of terrorism  may deter customers from visiting our properties 
we have limited opportunities to develop new properties 
the casino gaming industry has limited new development opportunities 
most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses 
although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming  in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations  such as pari mutuel racetracks 
moreover  it is not clear whether the tax  land use planning and regulatory structures that may be applicable to any new gaming opportunity would make the development and operation of a casino financially acceptable 
we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities that do arise  and many of the companies competing for such opportunities will have greater resources and name recognition than we do 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand our business through new development 
our business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking 
legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has recently been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions  including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
on january   a statewide smoking ban that includes casino floors went into effect in colorado 
we expect this ban will have some negative impact on business volume at our black hawk property  the magnitude of which we cannot yet predict 
in january  the city council of kansas city  missouri enacted an ordinance prohibiting smoking in most indoor public places within the city 
the ordinance  which goes into effect on march   contains an exemption for casino floors 
there will also be a separate proposal on the april  ballot in the city of kansas city to prohibit smoking in most indoor public places  including restaurants  which also contains an exemption for casino floors 
legislation continues to be considered in iowa that would ban smoking 
in january  a bill was introduced in the indiana legislature to ban smoking in most indoor public places  excluding casinos and bars 
if additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in jurisdictions in which we operate  particularly if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market  our business could be materially adversely affected 
the estate of craig h

craig h

neilsen and kanofsky serve as the co trustees of the foundation  and they also serve on the foundation s five person board of directors 
as officers and directors of aci  executors of the estate and trustees and directors of the foundation  messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky may be subject to certain conflicts of interest 
in light of their control over a majority of our common stock  messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky jointly have the ability to elect the entire board of directors over time and  except as otherwise provided by law or our articles of incorporation  to approve or disapprove other matters that may be submitted to a vote of the stockholders 
as a result  actions requiring stockholder approval that may be supported by a majority of the other stockholders  including a merger or sale of our assets or the issuance of a significant number of additional shares of common stock to finance acquisitions or other growth opportunities  could be blocked by messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky 
in addition  the estate s ownership affects the liquidity in the market for our common stock and sales by the estate could affect the price of our common stock 
messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky  as co executors of the estate  disclosed in a schedule d amendment filed with the securities and exchange commission in october that  on behalf of the estate  they will continue to review the estate s liquidity needs and other factors impacting the estate s investment in our common stock and may evaluate strategic alternatives to the estate s holdings in the company  including possible sales of some or all of our common stock held by the estate or one or more transactions that could influence or change control of the company 
some of the factors influencing the estate s investment decisions with respect to our common stock may not be relevant to other holders of our common stock 
a change in control could result in the acceleration of our debt obligations 
certain changes in control could result in the acceleration of our senior credit facilities 
this acceleration could be triggered in the event the estate or its beneficiaries  including the foundation  sells a substantial number of shares of our common stock  which they might have to do in order to pay estate tax liabilities or satisfy legal requirements applicable to shareholdings by private foundations 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay any indebtedness that is accelerated as a result of a change in control  and this would likely materially adversely affect our financial condition 
our business may be materially impacted by an act of terrorism or by additional security requirements that may be imposed on us 
the us department of homeland security has stated that places where large numbers of people congregate  including hotels  are subject to a heightened risk of terrorism 
an act of terrorism affecting one of our properties  whether or not covered by insurance  or otherwise affecting the travel and tourism industry in the united states  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our business may become subject to increased security measures designed to prevent terrorist acts 
our business may be adversely affected by our ability to retain and attract key personnel 
we depend on the continued performance of our entire senior executive team 
if we lose the services of any of our key executives or our senior property management personnel and cannot replace such persons in a timely manner  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel  including competition from numerous native american gaming facilities that are not subject to the same taxation regimes as we are and therefore may be willing and able to pay higher rates of compensation 
we currently have a number of 
table of contents vacancies in key corporate and property management positions 
if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our properties or at our corporate level  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
as we recruit personnel  we expect successful candidates to exhibit a collaborative  communicative and collegial nature 
we also employ a high degree of centralization in a highly decentralized industry 
we use multi faceted recruitment  assessment and interviewing approaches that include several levels of interactions and interviews over a period of time 
these factors create risk in attracting management personnel in a timely fashion  as well as hiring candidates we expect to be successful within our company 
adverse weather conditions or natural disasters in the areas in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
adverse weather conditions  particularly flooding  heavy snowfall and other extreme conditions  as well as natural disasters  can deter our customers from traveling or make it difficult for them to visit our properties 
if any of our properties were to experience prolonged adverse weather conditions  or if multiple properties were to simultaneously experience adverse weather conditions  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we have very limited insurance coverage for earthquake damage at our properties 
several of our properties  particularly ameristar st 
charles  are located near historically active earthquake faults 
in the event one of our properties were to sustain significant damage from an earthquake  our business could be materially adversely affected 
any loss from service of our riverboat and barge facilities for any reason could materially adversely affect us 
our riverboat and barge facilities could be lost from service due to casualty  mechanical failure  extended or extraordinary maintenance  floods or other severe weather conditions 
the ameristar vicksburg site has experienced ongoing geologic instability that requires periodic maintenance and improvements 
although we have reinforced the cofferdam basin in which the vessel is dry docked on a concrete foundation  further reinforcements may be necessary 
we are also monitoring the site to evaluate what further steps may be necessary to stabilize the site to permit operations to continue 
a site failure would require ameristar vicksburg to limit or cease operations 
the loss of a riverboat or barge facility from service for any period of time likely would adversely affect our operating results and borrowing capacity under our long term debt facilities in an amount that we are unable to reasonably estimate 
it could also result in the occurrence of an event of a default under our credit agreement 
we could face severe penalties and material remediation costs if we fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations 
as is the case with any owner or operator of real property  we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  emission and disposal of hazardous materials 
failure to comply with environmental laws could result in the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by government agencies or courts  which could adversely affect our operations 
we do not have environmental liability insurance to cover most such events  and the environmental liability insurance coverage we maintain to cover certain events includes significant limitations and exclusions 
in addition  if we discover any significant environmental contamination affecting any of our properties  we could face material remediation costs or additional development costs for future expansion activities

louis  missouri  ameristar kansas city serving the kansas city  missouri metropolitan area  ameristar council bluffs serving omaha  nebraska and southwestern iowa  resorts east chicago serving the chicagoland area  ameristar vicksburg serving jackson  mississippi and monroe  louisiana  ameristar black hawk serving the denver  colorado metropolitan area  and cactus petes and the horseshu in jackpot  nevada serving idaho and the pacific northwest 
we acquired resorts east chicago on september   and its operating results are included only from the acquisition date 
our financial results are dependent upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts those patrons spend per visit 
management uses various metrics to evaluate these factors 
key metrics include slots handle table games drop measurements of gaming volume  win hold percentages the percentage of handle or drop that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue  hotel occupancy rate the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period  average daily room rate average price of occupied hotel rooms per day  including those occupied on a complimentary basis  revpar revenue per available room is a summary measure of hotel results that combines average daily room rate and hotel occupancy rate  market share share of gross gaming revenues in each of our markets other than jackpot and our share of gaming devices in the jackpot market nevada does not publish separate gaming revenue statistics for this market  fair share percentage a percentage of gross gaming revenues based on the number of gaming positions relative to the total gaming positions in the market  admissions the number of patrons who enter our casinos in jurisdictions that record admissions  and win per admission the amount of gaming revenues generated per admission 
our operating results may be affected by  among other things  competitive factors  gaming tax increases  the commencement of new gaming operations  charges associated with debt refinancing or property acquisition and disposition transactions  construction at existing facilities  general public sentiment regarding travel  overall economic conditions affecting the disposable income of our patrons and weather conditions affecting our properties 
consequently  our operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily comparable and may not be indicative of future periods results 

table of contents the following significant factors and trends should be considered in analyzing our operating performance ameristar black hawk 
for seven consecutive quarters  ameristar black hawk has experienced significant growth in business volume and strong financial results following its rebranding in april our initial investment to upgrade the property s casino and restaurants  along with our focus on guest service and high quality food and gaming experiences  are key drivers of our continued success at black hawk 
the property s operating income increased million and the related operating income margin improved percentage points over the prior year 
our black hawk property s market share has increased by since the rebranding  improving from an market share to a market share for the quarter ended december  upon their completion scheduled for the second half of  the hotel and spa currently under construction will further position the property as an ameristar class facility that offers resort destination amenities and services that we believe are unprecedented in the denver gaming market 
on january   a statewide smoking ban extended to casino floors in colorado 
we expect this ban will have some negative impact on business volume at our black hawk property  the magnitude of which we cannot yet predict 
general economic conditions 
we believe the current softness in the united states economy began to adversely impact several of our markets in mid our vicksburg and council bluffs markets contracted and  respectively  when compared to  and our st 
louis  kansas city and chicagoland markets experienced nominal growth over the prior year 
the year ended december  represented the first time the council bluffs market contracted since our entry into that market in the vicksburg market declined in total gaming revenues year over year for the first time since in addition to the general downturn in the economy  the vicksburg market was negatively affected by the recapture of business by gulf coast casinos that have reopened following hurricane katrina in acquisition of resorts east chicago 
on september   we completed the acquisition of resorts east chicago  a casino hotel located in northwest indiana  serving the chicagoland area 
this acquisition has allowed us to enter the third largest commercial gaming market in the united states  and we believe it will create cash flow diversification and enhance our distribution channels 
following the acquisition  we began making initial improvements to the property  including changing the slot machine mix and layout of games and making enhancements to the food and beverage venues 
we currently expect that capital expenditures for these upgrades to the property will be in the range of million to million 
one time expenses in connection with the integration  enhancement and rebranding are expected to total between million and million  inclusive of the million incurred in we are beginning to redirect the property s marketing and promotional activities to maximize resorts east chicago s revenue and profitability  replicating the strategies that have proven successful at ameristar s other properties 
upon completion of the property upgrades and the implementation of our operating and marketing programs  we anticipate launching the ameristar brand in the chicagoland market no later than the third quarter of the property s competitiveness in this market is expected to progressively increase as the implementation of our operational and marketing approaches and the facility upgrades are completed 
separately  we are also developing preliminary plans for a major expansion of the facility to significantly enlarge and improve the gaming area  enhance access to the casino  provide additional structured parking and upgrade the non gaming amenities 
the timing and scope of such project will depend on various factors  including legislative developments related to the possible expansion of casino gaming in illinois 
capital investments in properties 
as discussed under liquidity and capital resources  we currently have major capital improvement projects in progress at our st 
charles  vicksburg and black hawk properties 
additionally  we currently expect to commence a major capital improvement project at our council bluffs property in  although the timing of this project is dependent on various factors 
upon completion  each of these projects is expected to improve the competitiveness  revenues and operating cash flow of these respective properties 
during construction  the operating performance of these properties may be subject to varying adverse impacts from construction disruption 
ameristar kansas city 
the ability to execute on an efficient operating model contributed to our kansas city property achieving operating income growth while experiencing a decrease in net revenues from the prior year 
ameristar kansas city s operating income margin increased percentage points over the same prior year period despite softer market conditions  an increase in 
table of contents adverse weather during the fourth quarter and a major expansion of a competitor s property 
debt and interest expense 
during  our net borrowings under our senior credit facility totaled million  of which million was utilized to fund the acquisition of resorts east chicago 
at december  and  our principal debt outstanding totaled billion and billion  respectively 
our total debt leverage ratio increased from as of december  to at december  we expect our net interest expense to increase for the foreseeable future due to the higher debt balance and larger interest rate add ons primarily resulting from our financing of the east chicago acquisition 
additionally  as we continue to progress on our major construction projects  we expect that our debt will increase further 
when we place those assets in service over the next two years  we will no longer capitalize the interest on the associated debt  which will also cause our net interest expense to rise

in  slot revenues increased million at the jackpot properties and our black hawk property benefited from a full year of operating results following its april rebranding 
in addition  the black hawk property benefited from reduced construction disruption following the completion of the initial phase of our expansion activities in the first quarter of the increases were partially offset by decreases from net revenues at our vicksburg  council bluffs and kansas city properties 
ameristar vicksburg s decline in net revenues was mostly attributable to the business recapture by the gulf coast casinos that continued throughout  significant construction related disruption at the property and general economic weakness in the region

operating income in  consolidated operating income increased million over  while consolidated operating income margin decreased by percentage point from the prior year 
the growth in operating income was substantially attributable to ameristar black hawk s strong financial performance and east chicago s contribution of million

charles hotel pre opening expenses and million in costs associated with the acquisition  integration and rebranding of the east chicago property 
consolidated operating income was also adversely affected by stock based compensation expense  which increased from million in to million in additionally  consolidated operating income was negatively impacted by million in additional property tax expense in the fourth quarter of for the east chicago property  which was the result of a significant increase in the assessed valuation of the real property issued by the county assessor in july while we have appealed the new tax assessment  we expect to continue to recognize significantly higher than anticipated property tax expense at east chicago in and future years

table of contents year ended december  versus year ended december  net revenues consolidated net revenues for the year ended december  increased over the growth was primarily attributable to increases over the prior year of at ameristar black hawk and at ameristar vicksburg  partially offset by a decrease at ameristar council bluffs 
the black hawk property benefited from the rebranding and reduced construction disruption following the completion of the initial phase of our expansion activities in the first quarter of our vicksburg property s improved financial performance and the growth in the overall vicksburg market are mostly attributable to the third quarter closure of the mississippi gulf coast casinos following hurricane katrina 
consolidated casino revenues for increased million over the prior year  principally due to a million increase in slot revenues at ameristar black hawk  which now features an additional slot machines on its expanded casino floor 
we further believe consolidated casino revenues increased in part as a result of the continued successful implementation of our targeted marketing programs  as evidenced by an overall increase in rated play at our properties over for the years ended december  and  promotional allowances as a percentage of casino revenues remained unchanged at 
our strategy to maximize profitability through efficient promotional spending during the second half of offset the increased promotional spending during the first half of that was primarily caused by competitive pressures at our council bluffs and missouri properties 
operating income in  consolidated operating income increased million  or  over  while consolidated operating income margin decreased by percentage point from the prior year 
the growth in operating income was substantially attributable to ameristar black hawk s and ameristar vicksburg s strong financial performance 
ameristar black hawk s financial results included million in rebranding costs 
the financial performance of our black hawk and vicksburg properties was partially offset by the results of our council bluffs property  which experienced declines in operating income and the related margin from the prior year as a result of enhanced competition 
consolidated operating income was adversely affected by the million in stock based compensation expense we were required to recognize beginning in consolidated operating income was also impacted by an million increase in depreciation and amortization expense over  primarily due to million in depreciation expense from the capital improvements placed in service as part of the ameristar black hawk expansion 
we anticipate that depreciation expense will continue to rise as a result of our ongoing major capital projects at st

the interest savings resulting from the lower interest rates were partially offset by an increase from of million in the weighted average total debt balance outstanding 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate was in and in the federal income tax statutory rate was in both years 
the rise in our effective tax rate is mostly attributable to increased pre tax income generated by our properties located in states with higher income tax rates

the increase in operating cash flows from to was mostly attributable to contributions to consolidated operating income by our east chicago and black hawk properties and positive changes in several of our working capital assets and liabilities 
the decline in operating cash flows from to was attributable in part to increases in income tax cash payments and debt service payments and the decrease in net income as discussed above

we opened the first guest suites of the hotel during january and had a total of suites in operation as of february  over each of the next several months  to suites are expected to be added until completion in may the hotel s well appointed  oversized suites offer what we believe are the area s most upscale accommodations 
the total cost of these ongoing and completed projects is expected to be approximately million 
additionally  construction work on the roadway project to improve the primary access to ameristar st 
charles was substantially completed in december the new boulevard reduces long standing access constraints to the property by accommodating more traffic at peak periods  as well as upgrading the aesthetics of the approach to the property  including improved lighting and landscaping 
construction disruption impacted business volumes and operating results at ameristar st 
charles during the fourth quarter of  but we believe this project will provide an important advantage for the property after opening the hotel  particularly in light of a competitor opening a new facility in downtown st 
louis in december we organized a transportation development district tdd and a community improvement district in st 
charles  missouri to acquire land and develop and construct improvements for the roadway improvement project 
the approximate estimated cost of the project is million and is being funded by proceeds of million from tax exempt bonds issued by the tdd and advances to the tdd by the company  which will be repaid through an additional two percent sales tax on non gaming revenues at ameristar st 
charles over a period of years 
we have also added several enhanced amenities to the st

both the expanded gaming facility and the new  space parking garage are expected to open in june two new restaurants  a vip club and retail space are expected to be completed in the third quarter of a million renovation to the room hotel was completed in december we expect the expansion and the recently completed renovation to further strengthen the property s long standing dominant position in the market 
we continue to evaluate design alternatives for the council bluffs expansion project 
the current plan includes doubling the casino floor by adding approximately  square feet to the facility  with a budget of approximately million and a scheduled completion date in the second half of by reducing capacity constraints during peak periods and providing an enhanced  more spacious casino experience  we expect this project will increase revenues at the property and grow the market overall 
however  the timing of this project is dependent on various factors  including market conditions  our borrowing capacity and possible additional competition in the council bluffs market 
the construction of our four diamond quality hotel is progressing at ameristar black hawk 
excavation and rock removal was completed in the fourth quarter of the story tower s well appointed  oversized rooms will feature upscale furnishings and amenities 
the tower will include a versatile meeting and ballroom center and will also have black hawk s only full service spa  an enclosed rooftop swimming pool and indoor outdoor whirlpool facilities 
once completed  ameristar black hawk will offer destination resort amenities and services that we believe are unprecedented in the denver gaming market 
the hotel s completion date is expected to be the second half of  and the cost of the hotel is now expected to be between million million  representing an increase of million to million over the previous budget 
the revised cost estimate is mostly attributable to increases in materials costs and unforeseen site conditions that necessitated the relocation of incoming utilities 
the hotel at cactus petes is currently undergoing renovation 
the project is expected to be completed by memorial day at a cost of approximately million 
for the years ended december   and  cash flows provided by  or used in  financing activities were impacted by debt borrowings  principal payments on long term debt  dividend payments  proceeds from employee stock option exercises and purchases of treasury stock 
financing cash flows during were impacted by the february  redemption of our senior subordinated notes with borrowings under our revolving loan facility 
additionally  in november  we borrowed million as a term loan under our new credit facility  of which million was used to repay the principal amount of loans outstanding under our prior senior credit facilities  with the balance being held to provide funding for future capital needs

for the year ended december   we repurchased million shares at a cost of million 
liquidity on september   we amended our senior credit facility to increase the total amount of permitted incremental loan commitments from million to million 
the amendment also increased the maximum permitted leverage ratio and senior leverage ratio both as defined in the senior credit facility for fiscal quarters ending on and after september   raised the interest rate add on for our term loan by basis points and permitted us to acquire resorts east chicago for an amount including related transaction costs and expenses not to exceed million  without reducing the amount we could spend for other permitted acquisitions 
the incremental loans are subject to the same interest rates and terms of payment as the existing revolving loans 
on september   we acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of rih acquisitions in  llc rih from resorts international holdings  llc 
rih owns and operates resorts east chicago 

table of contents pursuant to the purchase agreement dated as of april   as subsequently amended  the purchase price is subject to a post closing working capital adjustment as provided in the purchase agreement 
we paid million  net of cash acquired  for rih 
we financed the purchase of rih by additional borrowings under our revolving loan facility 
we incurred approximately million in acquisition costs that were included in the purchase price and million in capitalized debt issuance costs  which will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the revolving credit facility 
at december   our principal debt outstanding primarily consisted of billion under the revolving loan facility and million under the term loan facility 
as of december   the amount of the revolving loan facility available for borrowing was million  after giving effect to million of outstanding letters of credit 
all mandatory principal repayments have been made through december  the agreement governing the senior credit facilities requires us to comply with various affirmative and negative financial and other covenants  including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  restrictions on dividend payments and other restrictions and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios and tests 
as of december  and  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
as of december   in addition to the million available for borrowing under the senior credit facilities  we had million of cash and cash equivalents  approximately million of which were required for daily operations 
our capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million 
we anticipate spending approximately million on maintenance capital expenditures including the acquisition of slot machines and other long lived assets  approximately million in capital expenditures related to the east chicago property rebranding and approximately million on internal expansion projects 
actual capital expenditures will depend on the start date of certain projects and the progress of construction through year end 
as described in more detail above  our current major internal expansion projects include completion of the construction of the room  all suite hotel with an indoor outdoor swimming pool and a  square foot full service spa at ameristar st 
charles  construction of the room  four diamond quality hotel with related amenities at ameristar black hawk  the casino expansion project at ameristar vicksburg  the planned council bluffs casino expansion  and the cactus petes hotel renovation project 
historically  we have funded our daily operations through net cash provided by operating activities and our significant capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flows  bank debt and other debt financing 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents and availability under our senior credit facilities will be able to support our operations and liquidity requirements  including all of our currently planned capital expenditures and dividend payments on our common stock 
however  if our existing sources of cash are insufficient to meet such needs  or if we fail to remain in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior credit facilities  we will be required to seek additional financing  scale back our capital plans and or seek an amendment to the senior credit facilities 
any loss from service of our riverboat and barge facilities for any reason could materially adversely affect us  including our ability to fund daily operations and to satisfy debt covenants 
our ability to borrow funds under the senior credit facilities at any time is primarily dependent upon the amount of our ebitda  as defined for purposes of the senior credit facilities  for the preceding four fiscal quarters

as noted above  a significant operating use of cash in is interest payments 
our cash interest payments  excluding capitalized interest  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash interest payments may increase in as a result of a possible rise in interest rates and an expected increase in the average outstanding debt balance from anticipated borrowings under the billion revolving loan facility to fund our capital improvement projects 
for more information  see note long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business  including construction contracts for projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole 
our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts 
in december  we assumed several agreements with the missouri highway transportation development district development district that had been entered into in order to assist the development district in the financing of a highway improvement project in the area around the ameristar kansas city property prior to our purchase of that property 
in order to pay for the highway improvement project  the development district issued revenue bonds totaling million in principal amount with scheduled 
table of contents maturities from through we have issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit with a bank in support of obligations of the development district for certain principal and interest on the revenue bonds 
the amount outstanding under this letter of credit was million as of december  and may be subsequently reduced as principal and interest mature under the revenue bonds 
additionally  we are obligated to pay any shortfall in the event that amounts on deposit are insufficient to cover the obligations under the bonds as well as any costs incurred by the development district that are not payable from the taxed revenues used to satisfy the bondholders 
through december   we had paid million in shortfalls and other costs 
as required by the agreements  we anticipate that we will be reimbursed by the development district for these shortfall payments from future available cash flow  as defined  and have recorded a corresponding receivable as of december  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million  which reduced the amount available to borrow under our revolving loan facility 
we do not have any other guarantees  contingent commitments or other material liabilities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions  particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates  where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and  generally to a lesser extent  cash flows 
senior management and the audit committee of our board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates  and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets  salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and the extent to which we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy  which we believe is representative of the useful life of each category of assets 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors we consider in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had approximately million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet resulting from our acquisition of resorts east chicago in september and the missouri properties in december as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we completed our annual assessment for impairment and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
the assessment requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine its estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
customer rewards programs our customer rewards programs allow customers to earn certain point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services based on the volume of the customers gaming activity 
customers can accumulate reward points over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the programs 
the reward credit balance is forfeited if a customer does not earn any reward credits over any subsequent 
table of contents month period 
as a result of the ability of the customer to bank the reward points  we accrue the expense of reward points  after giving effect to estimated forfeitures  as they are earned 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  were accrued under the programs 
the value of these point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services are netted against revenue as a promotional allowance 
cash coupons our former  current and future gaming customers may be awarded  on a discretionary basis  cash coupons based  in part  on their play volume 
the coupons are provided on a discretionary basis to induce future play  are redeemable within a short time period generally seven days and are redeemable only on a return visit 
there is no ability to renew or extend the offer 
we recognize a reduction in revenue as a promotional allowance for these coupons when the coupons are redeemed 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation and employee medical coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
at december  and  our estimated liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims totaled million and million  respectively 
we utilize actuaries who consider historical loss experience and certain unusual claims in estimating these liabilities  based upon statistical data provided by the independent third party administrators of the various programs 
we believe the use of this method to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals  however  changes in health care costs  accident or illness frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities 
accounting for share based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
these fair values are calculated by using the black scholes merton option pricing formula  which requires estimates for expected volatility  expected dividends  the risk free interest rate and the term of the option 
sfas no 
r revised sfas no

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application transition method 
under this transition method  the future compensation cost related to all equity instruments granted prior to but not yet vested as of adoption is recognized based on the grant date fair value  which is estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
the grant date fair value of the awards is generally recognized as expense over the service period 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  we are required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited and update that number based on actual forfeitures 
previously  we had recognized the impact of forfeitures as they occurred 
with respect to the determination of the pool of windfall tax benefits  we elected to use the transition election of fasb staff position no 
fas r the short cut method as of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively  as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
no such expense was recorded in as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share based compensation arrangements granted under the company s stock incentive plans 
this unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
income taxes our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate 
we assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of fin  which we adopted on january  fin prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
as a result  our income tax recognition policy related to uncertain income tax positions is no longer covered by sfas no 
fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to sfas no 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step i occurs when we conclude that a tax position  based on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step ii is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained 
under step ii  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement 
fin s use of the term more likely than not is consistent with how that term is used in sfas no 
ie  the likelihood of occurrence is greater than 
the tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are to be recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard 
if it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the more likely than not standard  it is required that the tax position be derecognized 
fin specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions 
as applicable  we will recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our senior credit facilities 
as of december   we had billion outstanding under our senior credit facilities  bearing interest at variable rates 
the senior credit facilities bear interest equal to libor in the case of eurodollar loans or the prime interest rate in the case of base rate loans  plus an applicable margin  or add on 
at december   the average interest rate applicable to the senior credit facilities was 
an increase of one percentage point in the average interest rate applicable to the senior credit facilities outstanding at december  would increase our annual interest cost by approximately million 
substantially all of our long term debt is subject to variable interest rates 
we continue to monitor interest rate markets and  in order to control interest rate risk  may enter into interest rate collar or swap agreements or other derivative instruments as market conditions warrant 
we may also choose to refinance a portion of our variable rate debt through the issuance of long term fixed rate debt
