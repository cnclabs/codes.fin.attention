item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a special note regarding forward looking statements the following discussion and analysis should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and and accompanying notes set forth elsewhere in this report 
all financial information is presented in us dollars 
some of the statements set forth in this section are forward looking statements relating to our future results of operations 
our actual results may vary from the results anticipated by these statements 
please see information concerning forward looking statements on page overview our mission is to make the internet easier and more effective for users 
we accomplish this by reducing the complexity our customers experience as they acquire  deliver or use internet services such as domain name registration  hosted email and other internet services 
our primary distribution channel is a global distribution network of more than  resellers  in more than countries who offer our services to their own customers 
this distribution channel is comprised primarily of web hosting companies  isps  and other providers of internet services who typically provide their customers  the end users of the internet  with a critical component for establishing and maintaining an online presence 
we also offer internet services to consumers and small businesses through our retail web sites domaindirect 
com  netidentity 
com and itsyourdomain 
com 
in addition  we hold a domain name portfolio that is available for sale or lease  the generation of revenue as part of our pay per click advertising program and support our personalized email programs through our portfolio of surname based domain names 
tucows 
com remains one of the most popular software download sites on the internet 
our business model has been characterized by non refundable  up front payments  which lead to recurring revenue and positive operating cash flow 
we are an accredited registrar with icann and manage over million domains 
net revenues we generate net revenues primarily through the provision of domain registration and other internet services 
additional revenue is generated from the sale of domain names and advertising and other services 
to assist us in forecasting growth and to help us monitor the effectiveness of our operational strategies we categorize our revenue as follows traditional domain registration services historically traditional domain registration has been the largest portion of our business and encompasses all of our services as an accredited registrar related to the registration  renewal  transfer and management of domain names through our global reseller distribution network 
in addition  traditional domain registration fuels other revenue categories as it often is the initial service for which a customer will engage us  enabling us to follow on with other services  and it allows us to add to our domain portfolio by purchasing names registered through us  once they expire 
on august   in advance of the announced october registry fee increases  we modified our pricing structure for traditional domain names to provide greater visibility into the various fees that make up the cost of a domain name  by breaking out the cost of the registry and icann fees separately from our management fee 
the management fee provides our resellers with access to our provisioning and management tools to enable them to register and administer domain names and access to additional services like whois privacy and managed dns services  enhanced domain name suggestion tools and access to our premium domain name services 
in addition  through our acquisition of its your domain in july  we have contractual relationships with third party resellers to sell our domain name registration and other internet services under their own brands 
we pay our resellers an amount based on the difference between the pricing of their sale of the given service and the wholesale rate upon which we agree

with respect to the sale of domain registrations  we earn fees in connection with each new  renewed and transferred in registration and from providing provisioning services to resellers and registrars on a monthly basis 
domain registrations are generally purchased for terms of one to ten years  with a majority having a one year term 
except for certain large customers with whom we have negotiated alternative arrangements  payments for the full term of service  or billed revenue  is received at the time of activation of service 
all fees received in connection with domain name registration are non refundable and where appropriate are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
domain portfolio services we derive revenue from our domain name portfolio of over  domain names by making them available as part of our pay per click advertising or parked pages program and by making them available for sale or lease 
parked pages are domain names registered with us that do not yet contain an active website 
when a user types one of these domain names into the command line of the browser direct navigation  they are presented with dynamically generated links which are pay per click advertising 
every time a user clicks on one of the links listed on a web page  it generates revenue for us through our partnership with third parties who provide syndicated pay per click results 
portfolio names are sold through our premium domain name service  auctions or in negotiated sales 
in evaluating these names for sale  we consider the potential foregone revenue from pay per click advertising as well as other factors 
the name will be offered for sale if based on our evaluation the name is deemed non essential to our business  and management believes that the proceeds from this sale is strategically more beneficial to the company 
portfolio names that have been acquired from third parties or through acquisition are included as intangible assets with indefinite lives on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we also offer the same services to our customers allowing them to make available names registered by them for monetization on a similar basis 
for customer names  in the case of premium names or names sold or leased  we earn a referral fee while for names offered through our pay per click advertising program we participate on a revenue share basis 
we recognize revenue from these services  net of any fees payable to resellers or customers  immediately upon completion of the service or in the case of advertising from direct navigation  on a monthly basis once the advertising has been served 
email services we derive revenue from our hosted email service through our global distribution network 
our email service currently offers providers the option of either  provisioning and managing mailboxes for their customers using our complete end to end email solution or of using the spam and virus filtering portion of our service in conjunction with their current email infrastructure 
our fully hosted email service consists of pop  imap  wap and webmail access  spam and virus filtering and gb of mail storage 
in addition  effective february   our resellers can offer our personalized email service to their customers through our global distribution network 
our personal names service allows resellers the opportunity to sell email addresses based on our domain portfolio of surname domain names 
each personal names service account comes with our complete end to end email solution together with a custom domain name eg amy 
smith 
net that can be tied to a website  blog or any other web service 
we earn fees for email services when they are activated 
email services are generally purchased monthly and at month end  are either deducted  on a pre authorized basis  from reseller s deposit account or are invoiced 
retail services we generate revenues from the provisioning and management of internet services on a retail basis  to consumers and small businesses through our domain direct  netidentity and its your domain websites 
these services include domain registration and other internet services such as email  personalized email through our portfolio of surname based domain names  blogware  hosting and website creation 
depending on the service offered  we typically receive standard fees for our services that are published on the respective websites 
in addition  we offer referral commissions  based on a percentage of net registration revenues  to participants in our affiliate program 
services are generally purchased for terms of one to ten years  with a majority having a one year term with some services being offered on a monthly basis 
payments for the full term of all services  or billed revenue  are received at the time of activation of service and where appropriate are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
other services other internet services currently consist of digital certificates  billing  provisioning and customer care software solutions  blogware and website building tools which are used by our resellers to create bundles of internet services for their end users 
we earn fees when a service is activated 
other internet services are generally purchased for terms of one month to three years 
payments for other internet services are for the full term of all services at the time of activation of service and where appropriate are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
we also generate advertising and other revenue  or content revenue  through our online libraries of shareware  freeware and online services presented at our website  http tucows 
com 
our software libraries advertising revenue is generated from third party advertisers and from software developers who rely on us as a primary source of distribution 
software developers use our author resource center  or arc  to submit their products for inclusion in our software libraries and to purchase promotional placement of their software in the library categories  as well as purchase other promotional services on a cost per click through or flat rate basis 
software developers are able to promote their software through advertising services including keyword search placements  banners  promotional placements  expedited reviews and premium data services 
revenue is also generated from companies who contract with us to provide them with co branded content 
advertising and other revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which it is presented 
critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and methods 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties made by management that may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   or fiscal  includes further information on the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the application of these estimates  including those related to the recoverability of investments  useful lives of intangible assets  valuation of goodwill  product development costs  revenue recognition and deferred revenue and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition policy we earn revenues from the following services traditional domain registration services  domain portfolio services  email services  retail services and other services 
with respect to the sale of domain registrations and other internet services  we earn registration fees in connection with each new  renewed and transferred in registration and from providing provisioning services to resellers and registrars on a monthly basis 
we also enter into revenue arrangements in which a reseller may purchase a combination of services multiple element arrangements 
when fair value exists for all elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements 
fair value is established by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
for arrangements where fair value exists only for the undelivered elements  we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue  related to the delivered items  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
payments for the full term of all services  or billed revenue  are received at the time of activation of service and where appropriate are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
revenue from the sale of domain names consists primarily of amounts earned for the transfer of rights to domain names that are currently under the company s control 
collectibility of revenues generated is subject to a high level of uncertainty  accordingly revenues are recognized only as received 
we also generate advertising and other revenue through our online libraries of shareware  freeware and online services presented at our website  http tucows 
com  as well as from traffic and search sessions originating on our portfolio of domain names 
advertising and other revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which it is presented 
to the extent that the minimum number of impressions we guarantee to customers is not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions are achieved 
changes to contractual relationships in the future could impact the amounts and timing of revenue recognition 
in those cases where payment is not received at the time of sale  additional conditions for recognition of revenue apply 
the conditions are i that the collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and ii that we have no further performance obligations 
we record expected refunds  rebates and credit card charge backs as a reduction of revenues at the time of the sale based on historical experiences and current expectations 
should these expectations not be met  adjustments will be required in future periods 
we establish reserves for possible uncollectible accounts receivable and other contingent liabilities which may arise in the normal course of business 
historically  credit losses have been within our expectations and the reserves we have established have been appropriate 
however  we have  on occasion  experienced issues which have led to accounts receivable not being fully collected 
should these issues occur more frequently  additional reserves may be required 
product development costs we account for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  as more fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal our policy on capitalizing internally developed software costs determines the timing of its recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or depreciation of property and equipment 
management reassesses these judgments on an ongoing basis 
changes in management s assessment could impact the recognition of development costs in our accounts 
valuation of intangible assets  goodwill and long lived assets our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we may incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas  which requires that we test goodwill  identifiable intangibles and long lived assets for impairment at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas we determine if the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets or goodwill are impaired based on a projected discounted cash flow model using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
management will base its estimates in preparing the discounted cash flows on historical experience and on various other assumptions  including current market trends and developments  ongoing customer developments and general economic factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment on at least an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances warrant 
these impairment tests involve the use of discounted cash flow analyses to assess the fair value of the indefinite lived assets and the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets 
these analyses involve estimates of future cash flows  estimated periods of use and applicable discount rates 
if the fair values of these assets as determined above were less than the related carrying values  impairment losses would have been recognized  as applicable 
management has determined that there is no impairment of the carrying value of these surname domain names and direct navigation domain names at december  the company has chosen december st as the date of its annual impairment test 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level 
while the ceo  who is the company s chief operating decision maker  monitors the sales of various products  operations are managed and financial performance evaluated based upon the sales and production of multiple products employing common network costs  research and development resources  sales and administrative support  and facilities 
this allows the company to leverage its costs in an effort to maximize return 
the company believes that any allocation of such shared expenses to various products would be impractical and arbitrary and it currently does not make such allocations internally 
as such  the company considers itself a single reporting unit 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  the provisions of sfas require the application of a fair value based test at the reporting unit level 
we performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of december   and  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  long lived intangible assets with determinable economic life are tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
we determined that there were no events or circumstances that affected the recoverability of long lived assets 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
effective january   we adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit to assess if the amount is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
as we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  historical and future levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered 
in the event that it is determined that the deferred tax assets to be realized in the future would be in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should it be determined that all or part of a recorded net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future  an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination would be made 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the probability that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered to assess its realizability 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we will increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable income 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  impacting net income or net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
accounting for stock based employee compensation on january   we adopted the fair value based method for measurement and cost recognition of employee stock based compensation arrangements under the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment or sfas r  using the modified prospective application transitional approach 
previously  we had elected to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method based upon accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees or apb and related interpretations 
the intrinsic value method generally did not result in any compensation cost being recorded for employee stock options since the exercise price was equal to the market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
under the modified prospective application transitional approach  stock based compensation is recognized for awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled subsequent to the date of adoption of sfas r 
in addition  stock based compensation is recognized  subsequent to the date of adoption of sfas r  for the remaining portion of unvested outstanding awards granted prior to the date of adoption 
prior periods have not been adjusted and we continue to provide pro forma disclosure as if it had accounted for employee share based payments in all periods prior to the adoption of sfas r in accordance with the fair value provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which is presented below 
we measure stock based compensation costs on the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award 
we have elected to treat awards with graded vesting as a single award when estimating fair value 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the employee requisite service period  which in our circumstance is the stated vesting period of the award  provided that total compensation cost recognized at least equals the pro rata value of the award that has vested 
compensation cost is initially based on the estimated number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 
this estimate is adjusted to the vesting date once actual forfeitures are known 
had we adopted the fair value based method for accounting for stock based compensation in all prior periods presented  the pro forma impact on net income and net income per share would be as follows year ended december  net income  as reported  add stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net income  net of tax deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all rewards  net of tax  net income  pro forma  basic earnings per common share  as reported basic earnings per common share  pro forma refer to note share based payments in these consolidated financial statements for details of stock options and stock based compensation cost recorded during fiscal results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net revenues the following table presents our net revenues  by revenue source year ended december  traditional domain registration services   domain portfolio services   email services   retail services   other services   increase over prior period  increase percentage the following table presents our revenues  by revenue source  as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  traditional domain registration services domain portfolio services email services retail services other services total net revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  or fiscal deferred revenue from domain name registrations and other internet services at december  increased to million from million at december  no customer accounted for more than of revenue during fiscal and at december   one customer accounted for of accounts receivable 
significant management judgment is required at the time of recording of revenue to assess whether the collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
on an ongoing basis we assess the ability of our customers to make required payments 
based on this assessment  we expect the carrying amount of our outstanding receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  to be fully collected 
traditional domain registration services net revenues from traditional domain registration services for fiscal compared to fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was primarily as a result of increased volumes from new and existing customers 
the market for domain name and other internet services remains intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
effective august  as part of our ongoing initiatives to improve our competitive position and to provide wholesale domain resellers a transparent cost breakdown  we invested in a new cost plus domain pricing structure and a reduction in our domain name pricing 
these steps have contributed to our average selling price declining and are likely to adversely impact our revenue and profitability in the short term 
they also may or may not result in increased volumes  which would adversely impact our revenues and profitability in the longer term 
during fiscal  the number of domain names that we processed increased by  to million new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations  compared to fiscal this increase resulted primarily from our continuing to compete aggressively to attract new clients and retain existing customers and by the incremental registrations we generated as a result of our acquisition of its your domain  or iyd  in july while we anticipate that the number of new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations will incrementally increase  the volatility in the market could affect the growth of domain names under our management 
at december   the total number of domain names under our management increased by million to million  compared to the total number of domain names under our management as at december  partly as a result of the names we acquired in our acquisition of iyd in july as of december   we provided provisioning services on a monthly basis to accredited registrars who use our technical systems to process domain registrations with their own accreditation 
as a result of the insolvency of one of our accredited registrars during fiscal   of the names we had under management for this registrar have now transferred to another registrar 
as of december   we managed an incremental million domain names on behalf of other accredited registrars  compared to million inclusive of the  names from the insolvent registrar for accredited registrars at december  domain portfolio services net revenues from our domain portfolio services for fiscal compared to fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
this increase resulted primarily from sales of names from our portfolio of domain names amounting to million during fiscal these sales included a million sale of approximately  domain names during the fiscal quarter ended june  in addition  the revenue we earned from the delivery of third party advertisements on parked pages during fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
the market for monetization of domain names is rapidly evolving and there is no guarantee that we will be able to grow revenue at the rate achieved in fiscal  nor that we will be able to continue to acquire the same caliber of names for our portfolio from future expiring domains or that names we acquire in future will provide the same revenue impact as past acquisitions 
email services net revenues from email services for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease resulted primarily from our losing enterprise customers that were acquired as part of hosted messaging business of critical path  inc in january that were not part of our strategic focus and who were receiving pricing that was not competitive in the marketplace 
since our primary interest is in the reseller customers in the critical path inc customer base  we felt the proper course of action would be for us to continue to support enterprise customers for as long as they choose to utilize our service and to assist any enterprise customer who wished to migrate either in house or to another supplier to do so 
retail services net revenues from retail services for fiscal compared to fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
the primary contributor to this increase was an increase of million from our provisioning personalized email through our portfolio of surname based domain names through the netidentity website 
as this website was acquired as part of the mailbank 
com inc acquisition in june  fiscal was the first full year of our offering this service 
we also saw increased revenue from retail domain registration and other internet services of million  the result of a combination of acquisitions and organic growth 
other services other services currently include revenue from digital certificates  billing  provisioning and customer care software solutions  blogware and website building tools  or other internet services  which are used by our resellers to create bundles of internet services for their end users and content 
other revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease was primarily the result of a decline in content of million being offset by increases in other internet services  mainly in digital certificates  blogware and billing  provisioning and customer care software solutions 
the decrease in content revenue primarily reflects the contraction in the yields from our syndicated google feeds and to a lesser extent slower advertising through our website 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes the costs associated with providing domain registration  other internet services  the costs of domain name sales  advertising and other revenue and network costs 
cost of revenues for traditional domain registrations represents the amortization of registry fees on a basis consistent with the recognition of revenues from our customers  namely ratably over the term of provision of the service 
registry fees  the primary component of cost of revenues  are paid in full when the domain is registered  and are initially recorded as prepaid domain registry fees 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
costs of revenues for domain portfolio services represent the amortization of registry fees for domains added to our portfolio over the renewal period which is generally one year  the value ascribed under intangible assets to any domain name sold and any impairment charges that may arise from our assessment of the domain name intangible assets 
as the total names in our portfolio continue to grow this will become a more significant component of our cost of revenues 
payments for domain registrations are payable for the full term of service at the time of activation of service and are recorded as prepaid cost of goods sold and are expensed ratably over the term of provision of service 
costs of revenues for retail services include the amortization of registry fees on a basis consistent with the recognition of revenues from our customers  namely ratably over the term of provision of the service and includes the amortization of registry fees payable to renew the domains in our surname portfolio 
registry fees  the primary component of cost of revenues  are paid in full when the domain is registered  and are recorded as prepaid domain registry fees 
cost of revenues for retail services also includes monthly license fees payable for hosting services 
costs of revenues for other services include the fees paid to third party service providers  primarily for digital certificates and printing services in connection with our billing  provisioning and customer care software solutions 
fees payable for digital certificates are amortized on a basis consistent with the provision of service  generally one year 
monthly printing fees are included in cost of revenues in the month they are incurred 
network costs include personnel and related expenses  depreciation and amortization  communication costs  equipment maintenance  stock based compensation and employee and related costs directly associated with the management and maintenance of our network 
communication costs include bandwidth  co location and provisioning costs we incur to support the supply of all our services 
the following table presents our cost of revenues  by revenue source  for the periods presented year ended december  traditional domain registration services   domain portfolio services   email services   retail services   other services   network  other costs   network  depreciation and amortization costs  increase over prior period  increase percentage the following table presents our cost of revenues  as a percentage of total cost of revenues for the periods presented year ended december  traditional domain registration services domain portfolio services email services retail services other services network  other costs network  depreciation and amortization costs cost of revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal costs for traditional domain registration services increased by million as a result of higher volumes of domain registrations and our responding to the continuing competitive nature of the domain name market 
costs for domain portfolio services increased by million  primarily the result of the amortization of renewal costs of domain names in our portfolio of generic domain names  which are recognized ratably over the term of the renewal 
retail and other services costs increased by million essentially as a result of increased volumes and network costs increased by million 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million in costs for email services  which reflect lower licensing and royalty costs payable to third party service providers 
network costs for fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was primarily the result of the additional labor  bandwidth and co location costs of million that we incurred as we continue to carry multiple systems at our data centers and includes the  of transitional costs relating to the transfer of operational knowledge from critical path inc employees  in connection with the acquisition of the hosted messaging assets of critical path inc that we incurred in fiscal these increases were offset in part by a reversal in march of a contingency of million that was accrued for a planned network operation initiative that the company did not pursue 
additional depreciation of million relating to information technology assets and increased amortization of million relating to our acquisitions  also contributed to the increased cost of revenues 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenue was primarily the result of the proportionately greater network costs incurred to support and manage our expanded internet service offerings  most notably our hosted email platform 
amortization of intangible assets consists of amounts arising in connection with the acquisition of technology from each of the boardtown corporation in april  the hosted messaging business of critical path  inc in january  mailbank 
com inc 
in june and innerwise  inc in july the technology purchased in connection with the acquisition of boardtown corporation is amortized on a straight line basis over seven years  and for innerwise  inc over three years  while the technology acquired in connection with each of the acquisitions of the hosted messaging assets of critical path  inc and the in house software of mailbank 
com inc is amortized on a straight line basis over two years 
prepaid domain registration and other internet services fees at december  increased by million  or  to million 
we expect network costs to increase as our network expands geographically and network activity increases 
these increases will be partially offset during fiscal as we begin the process of rationalizing some of the multiple systems we support and thereby reducing our overall footprint at our data centers 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs 
these costs include commissions and related expenses of our sales  product management  public relations  call center  support and marketing personnel 
other sales and marketing expenses include customer acquisition costs  advertising and other promotional costs 
year ended december  sales and marketing   increase over prior period  increase percentage percentage of net revenues sales and marketing expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million during fiscal the increase during fiscal was primarily the result of additional people costs of million  predominantly in customer service and marketing as we continue to invest in customer service improvements 
these increases were partially offset by our incurring lower traveling costs of million as our united kingdom office becomes more effective 
we believe that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we adjust our marketing programs and sales and customer support strategies to meet future opportunities in the marketplace 
technical operations and development technical operations and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and related expenses required to support the development of new or enhanced service offerings and the maintenance and upgrading of existing infrastructure 
this includes expenses incurred in the research  design and development of technology that we use to register domain names  email  retail  domain portfolio and other internet services  as well as to distribute our digital content services 
editorial costs relating to the rating and review of the software content libraries are included in the costs of product development 
in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and primarily include personnel costs for employees directly related to the development project 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
year ended december  technical operations and development   decrease over prior period  decrease percentage percentage of net revenues technical operations and development expenses for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million compared to million during fiscal this decrease during fiscal primarily resulted from people related costs  including contract and outside service costs  decreasing by million  principally as a result of the steps we took to streamline our operations in flint  michigan and the lower investment we need to make in the multiple systems that we are in the process of consolidating 
in addition  during fiscal we did not incur any transitional costs relating to the acquisition of the hosted messaging assets of critical path inc compared to million during fiscal these decreases were partially offset by our incurring million in transitional costs relating to the acquisition of innerwise  inc during fiscal and to a lesser extent by capitalized personnel costs for employees directly related to the application development stage of development projects decreasing by million during fiscal when compared to fiscal we expect technical operations and development expenses to increase slightly  in absolute dollars  going forward as our business continues to grow and as we further develop our applications and services

income taxes the following table presents our provision for income taxes  and effective tax rate for the periods presented year ended december  provision for recovery of income taxes   decrease over prior period  decrease percentage percentage of net revenues our provision for income taxes increased by million for fiscal and primarily relates to our alternative minimum tax obligations for fiscal no provision for income taxes other than for alternative minimum tax has been recorded for fiscal because we had net operating losses to offset against our operating income in our major operating jurisdictions 
we operate in various tax jurisdictions  and accordingly  our income is subject to varying rates of tax 
losses incurred in one jurisdiction cannot be used to offset income taxes payable in another 
our ability to use income tax loss carryforwards and future income tax deductions is dependant upon our operations in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arise 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december  the implementation of fin had no impact on tucows opening deficit 
as a result of the adoption of fin on january   we had approximately  of total gross unrecognized benefits 
at december   our unrecognized tax benefits have increased to  which if recognized would favorably affect the income tax rate in future periods 
the increase since adoption is primarily due to the non recognition of current year refundable research and development tax credits and foreign exchange 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit in tax expense 
we did not have any interest and penalties accrued as of january  and december  as the unrecognized tax benefit relates entirely to refundable tax credits 
we believes it is reasonably possible that  of the unrecognized tax benefit will decrease in the next twelve months as it is anticipated that the canadian tax authorities will review the company s research and development claim for the credits within that period

in accordance with terms of the purchase agreement  we may also use the escrow account as a source of recovery for any indemnification claims we may have against the former shareholders of iyd 
this incremental increase in funds we have in escrow was partially offset by million that was returned to us upon the release of the escrow accounts originally established in connection with the acquisition of boardtown corporation and by an additional payment of million being made to critical path as a result of their satisfaction of certain post closing conditions in the asset purchase agreement relating to customer retention

subsequent event on february  tucows entered into a series of forward plus contracts with a notional value of million  whereby  is converted into canadian dollars on a semi monthly basis through december  these forward plus contracts are designed to hedge our expected canadian dollar requirements over the period 
on each expiry date  we will sell us  and buy canadian dollars at the current exchange rate at a worst case rate  the base rate  of us cdn 
we benefit from a lower us cdn exchange rate on each of the expiry dates  as long as the limit rate us cdn has not been reached between the transaction inception and expiry date 
should the limit rate be reached at any point during this period  then all remaining forward plus contracts will be fixed at the base rate of us cdn for delivery on the respective value dates 
see additional discussion under quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in connection with the forward plus contracts that we entered into in february off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have not entered into any off balance sheet financial arrangements and have not established any special purpose entities as of december  nor have we guaranteed any debt or commitment of other entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  is presented in the table below 
purchase obligations include amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years operating lease obligations    purchase obligations    loan payable     note payable   total     item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in canada and sell these services in north america and europe 
our sales are primarily made in us dollars  while a major portion of expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of canadian and us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
based on the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material interest rate risk exposure at december  although we have a functional currency of us dollars  a substantial portion of our fixed expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
our policy with respect to foreign currency exposure is to manage financial exposure to certain foreign exchange fluctuations with the objective of neutralizing some of the impact of foreign currency exchange movements 
accordingly  we have entered into foreign exchange forward plus contracts to mitigate the exchange rate risk on portions of our canadian dollar exposure 
these contracts  entered into in february  will be utilized over the period ending december  on february  tucows entered into a series of forward plus contracts with a notional value of million  whereby  is converted into canadian dollars on a semi monthly basis for the period ending december  these forward plus contracts are designed to hedge the company s expected canadian dollar requirements over the period 
on each expiry date  the company will sell us  and buy canadian dollars at a worst case rate  the base rate  of us cdn  but can benefit from a lower us cdn exchange rate on each of the expiry dates  as long as the limit rate us cdn has not been reached between the transaction inception and expiry date 
should the limit rate be reached at any point during this period  then all remaining forward plus contracts will be fixed at the base rate of us cdn for delivery on the respective value dates 
as we do not comply with the documentation requirements for hedge accounting  we account for the fair value of the derivative instruments within the consolidated balance sheet as a derivative financial asset or liability and the corresponding change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we have no other freestanding or embedded derivative instruments 
the impact of the fair value adjustment on unrealized foreign exchange forward contracts for fiscal was a net gain of approximately  and for fiscal  the impact was a net loss of approximately  which is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations in general and administrative expenses 
as of december   we had no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis model for foreign exchange exposure over fiscal the analysis used a modeling technique that compares the us dollar equivalent of all expenses incurred in canadian dollars  at the actual exchange rate  to a hypothetical adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
foreign currency exchange rates used were based on the market rates in effect during fiscal the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a decrease in net income for fiscal of approximately million 
there can be no assurances that the above projected exchange rate decrease will materialize 
fluctuations of exchange rates are beyond the actions to hedge or mitigate these risks
