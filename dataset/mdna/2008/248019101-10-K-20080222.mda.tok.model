table of contents theft 
we also enhanced our stored value gift card program and launched deluxecalling sm  a service providing a first point of contact with new indirect loan consumers on behalf of our financial institution clients 
this service leverages our core competency of call center expertise and provides incremental revenue and increased customer retention for our financial institution clients 
providing products and services that differentiate us from the competition is expected to help offset the decline in check usage and the pricing pressures we are experiencing in our check programs 
as such  we are also focused on accelerating the pace at which we introduce new products and services 
in addition to these value added services  we continue to offer our knowledge exchange tm series  a suite of resources and events for our financial institution clients focused on the customer experience 
in addition to our initiatives to retain customers and introduce new products and services  we continue our efforts to simplify processes  eliminate complexity in this business and lower our cost structure 
our efforts are focused on using lean principles to streamline call center and check fulfillment activities  redesign services into standardized flexible models  eliminate multiple systems and work streams and strengthen our ability to quickly develop and bring new products and services to market 
direct checks our focus within direct checks is to enhance our share of the direct to consumer channel by continuing to implement the following strategies maintain our level of marketing spend  which was increased from previous years  maximize the lifetime value of customers by selling new features and accessories  and continue to optimize our cost and expense structure 
beginning in  we increased our advertising circulation of free standing inserts under a new direct mail advertising contract which will remain in effect for the next several years 
this has been an effective form of new customer acquisition in this channel 
we also intend to increase the portion of our advertising expense designated for customer retention by utilizing reactivation and email campaigns 
we continue to develop improved call center processes  provide additional products to direct checks small business customers and explore other avenues to increase sales to existing customers 
in late  we introduced the ezshield tm product  a fraud protection service that provides reimbursement to consumers for forged signatures or endorsements and altered checks

cost reduction initiatives we are pursuing aggressive cost reduction and business simplification initiatives  including reducing shared services infrastructure costs  streamlining our call center and check fulfillment activities  eliminating system and work stream redundancies  and strengthening our ability to quickly develop new products and services and bring them to market 
we believe significant cost reduction opportunities exist in the reduction of stock keeping units skus  the standardization of products and services and improvements in sourcing third party goods and services 
these opportunities collectively are expected to reduce our annual cost structure by at least million  net of required investments  by the end of the baseline for these anticipated savings is the annual diluted earnings per share guidance for of to  which we provided in our press release on july  regarding second quarter results 
we expect all three of our business segments to benefit from cost reductions 
we estimate that approximately of the million target will come from our shared services infrastructure organizations 
we expect information technology will provide the greatest percentage of these savings through lowering data center costs  improving mainframe and server utilization and reducing the cost of networking and voice communications 
we estimate that approximately of the million target will come from fulfillment  including manufacturing and supply chain  and we estimate that approximately of the million target will come from reorganizing our sales and marketing functions 
overall  approximately one third of the savings are expected to affect cost of goods sold  with the remaining two thirds impacting selling  general and administrative sg a expense 
through december   we estimate that we have realized approximately million of our million target 
we anticipate that we will realize an additional million of the million target in and the remaining million in 
table of contents business challenges the market for our two largest products  checks and business forms  is very competitive 
these products are mature and their use has been declining 
according to our estimates  the total number of checks written in the united states has been in decline as a result of alternative payment methods  including credit cards  debit cards  automated teller machines and electronic payment systems 
according to a federal reserve study released in december  approximately billion checks are written annually 
this includes checks which are converted to automated clearing house ach payments 
the check remains the largest single non cash payment method in the united states  accounting for approximately of all non cash payment transactions 
this is a reduction from the federal reserve study released in december when checks accounted for approximately of all non cash payment transactions 
the federal reserve estimates that checks written declined approximately four percent per year between and according to our estimates  the use of business checks is declining at a rate of two to four percent per year 
the total transaction volume of all electronic payment methods exceeds check payments  and we expect this trend to continue 
in addition to the decline in check usage  the use of business forms is also under pressure 
continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions 
for example  off the shelf business software applications and electronic transaction systems have been designed to automate several of the functions performed by business forms products 
because check usage is declining and financial institutions are consolidating  we have been encountering significant pricing pressure when negotiating contracts with our financial institution clients 
our traditional financial institution relationships are typically formalized through supply contracts averaging three to five years in duration 
as we compete to retain and acquire new financial institution business  the resulting pricing pressure  combined with declining check usage in the marketplace  has reduced our revenue and profit margins 
we expect this trend to continue 
direct checks and portions of small business services have been impacted by reduced consumer response rates to direct mail advertisements 
our own experience indicates that direct to consumer media response rates are declining across a wide variety of products and services 
additionally  our consumer response rates are declining further due to the decline in check usage and the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products 
we estimate that general economic conditions negatively impacted our results of operations in the latter half of the year  primarily in small business services 
the rate of small business formations and small business confidence impact small business services 
the index of small business optimism published by the national federation of independent business nfib in december continued to be below average 
according to estimates of the small business administration s office of advocacy  new small business formations were down slightly in as compared to  the most recent date for which information is available 
consumer spending and employment levels may also have some impact on our personal check businesses 
although both trended negatively during the last half of  we did not experience a significant negative impact in our personal check businesses 
we expect that general economic conditions will have some negative impact on our results of operations  primarily in small business services in the first half of the year 
a prolonged downturn in general economic conditions could result in additional declines in our revenue and profitability 
outlook for we anticipate that consolidated revenue will be between billion and billion for  as compared to billion for despite the decline in check usage and economic uncertainty  we expect to deliver near flat revenue performance in as compared to we anticipate that growth in small business services will be in the very low single digits  while declines in financial services will be in the low to mid single digits and declines in direct checks will be in the high single digits 
we expect that revenue from our expansion initiatives will grow modestly during the latter half of the year 
we expect that diluted earnings per share will be between and  compared to for we expect that operating income will increase from due to our cost reduction initiatives  partially offset by the impact of revenue declines in our personal check businesses  continued investments in new products and enablers  such as e commerce  and other cost increases 
we estimate that our effective tax rate for will be approximately  compared to for 
table of contents we anticipate that operating cash flow will be between million and million in  compared to million in we expect that increased earnings and working capital improvements throughout the year will be offset by higher payments for employee performance based compensation in the first quarter 
we estimate that capital spending will be approximately million in  with investment focused on cost reduction and key enablers such as e commerce 
our priorities for the use of cash include paying down our credit facility in and investing both organically and in acquisitions to augment growth 
we will also consider other opportunities to enhance shareholder value  including modest share repurchase opportunities and evaluating our dividend policy

we do not anticipate retiring outstanding long term debt as we believe that is not the best use of our financial resources at this time 
however  we may  from time to time  consider retiring outstanding debt through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
any such repurchases or exchanges would depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
we currently have a million commercial paper program in place which is supported by two committed lines of credit 
given our current credit ratings  the commercial paper market is not available to us 
as necessary  we utilize our million committed lines of credit to meet our working capital requirements 
the credit agreements governing the lines of credit contain customary covenants requiring a ratio of 
table of contents earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense of times  as well as limits on levels of subsidiary indebtedness

our current long term debt rating determined by standard poor s ratings services s p is bb with a stable outlook

our credit agreements do not include covenants or events of default tied directly to our credit ratings 
the million notes we issued in may place a limitation on restricted payments  including increases in dividend levels and share repurchases 
this limitation does not apply if the notes are upgraded to an investment grade credit rating 
contract acquisition costs other non current assets include contract acquisition costs of our financial services segment 
these costs  which are essentially pre paid product discounts  are recorded as non current assets upon contract execution and are amortized  generally on the straight line basis  as reductions of revenue over the related contract term 
cash payments made for contract acquisition costs were million in  million in and million in changes in contract acquisition costs for the last three years were as follows in thousands balance  beginning of year additions amortization refunds from contract terminations balance  end of year the number of checks being written has been in decline since the mid s  which has contributed to increased competitive pressure when attempting to retain or acquire clients 
both the number of financial institution clients requesting contract acquisition payments and the amount of the payments increased in the mid s  and has fluctuated significantly from year to year 
although we anticipate that we will selectively continue to make contract acquisition payments  we cannot quantify future amounts with certainty 
the amount paid depends on numerous factors such as the number and timing of contract executions and renewals  competitors actions  overall product discount levels and the structure of up front product discount payments versus providing higher discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
when the overall discount level provided for in a contract is unchanged  contract acquisition costs do not result in lower net revenue 
the impact of these costs is the timing of cash flows 
an up front cash payment is made rather than providing higher product discount levels throughout the term of 
table of contents the contract 
beginning in  we sought to reduce the use of up front product discounts by structuring new contracts with incentives throughout the duration of the contract 
we plan to continue this strategy 
liabilities for contract acquisition payments are recorded upon contract execution 
these obligations are monitored for each contract and are adjusted as payments are made 
contract acquisition payments due within the next year are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
these accruals were million as of december  and million as of december  accruals for contract acquisition payments included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were million as of december  and million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements  guarantees and contractual obligations it is not our general business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements or to guarantee the performance of third parties 
in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language 
these indemnifications encompass such items as product or service defects  including breach of security  intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and or employment related matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by our breach of the terms of the contract 
in disposing of assets or businesses  we often provide representations  warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including  for example  unknown damage to the assets  environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate  liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities  and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition 
we do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  we have no reason to believe that any likely liability under these indemnities would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  annual results of operations or annual cash flows 
we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications related to environmental matters 
further information can be found under the caption note other commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report

these contracts are primarily for information technology services 
additionally  purchase obligations include amounts due under direct checks direct mail advertising agreements and direct checks and financial services royalty agreements 
we routinely issue purchase orders to numerous vendors for the purchase of inventory and other supplies 
these purchase orders are not included in the purchase obligations presented here  as our business partners typically allow us to cancel these purchase orders as necessary to accommodate business needs 
certain of the contracts with third party service providers allow for early termination upon the payment of early termination fees 
if we were to terminate these agreements  we would have incurred early termination fees of million as of december  other long term liabilities consist primarily of amounts due for our postretirement benefit plans and liabilities for uncertain tax positions  deferred compensation and workers compensation 
of the million reported as other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   million is excluded from the obligations shown in the table above 
the excluded amounts include the following benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans we have contributed funds to these plans for the purpose of funding our obligations 
thus  we have the option of paying benefits from the assets of the plans or from the general funds of the company 
additionally  we expect the plan assets to earn income over time 
as such  we cannot predict when or if payments from the general funds of the company will be required 
as of december   three of our postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by a total of million 
payments for uncertain tax positions due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended time often needed to resolve income tax uncertainties  we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount or timing of cash payments that may be required to settle these liabilities 
our liability for uncertain tax positions  including accrued interest and penalties  was million as of december  a portion of the amount due under our deferred compensation plan under this plan  employees begin receiving payments upon the termination of employment or disability  and we cannot predict when these events will occur

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
the estimates and judgments utilized are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee of our board of directors at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
during the first quarter of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no

application of critical accounting policies goodwill and indefinite lived trade names as of december   goodwill was comprised of the following in thousands acquisition of nebs in june acquisition of designer checks  inc in february acquisition of the johnson group in october acquisition of direct checks in december acquisition of dots and pixels  inc in july acquisition of all trade computer forms  inc in february goodwill 
table of contents further information regarding the acquisitions which occurred during the past three years can be found under the caption note acquisitions and disposition of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis and between annual evaluations if events or circumstances occur which could indicate impairment 
as discussed earlier under segment results  our direct checks segment has been impacted by the decline in check usage  lower customer retention and lower direct mail consumer response rates 
to date  we have been able to offset to a large degree the impact of the resulting volume decline through cost management efforts and revenue from new accessories and services 
the impairment analysis completed during the third quarter of indicated no impairment of goodwill 
we also have two indefinite lived trade names  totaling million as of december   related to the nebs acquisition 
we continually evaluate the remaining useful lives of these assets to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if we subsequently determine that one or both of these assets has a finite useful life  we will first test the asset for impairment and then amortize the asset over its estimated remaining useful life 
indefinite lived trade names are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis and between annual evaluations if events or circumstances occur which could indicate that the asset is impaired 
the annual impairment analysis completed during the third quarter of found no indication of impairment 
the valuation determined that the fair value of these assets was million  compared to the carrying value of million 
in determining the fair value  we assumed a discount rate of and royalty rates of and 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the assets by million and a one percentage point decrease in the royalty rates would reduce the indicated fair value of the assets by million 
we are currently reassessing our branding strategy 
once this assessment is complete  we will evaluate the impact  if any  on the carrying value of our trade name intangible assets 
an impairment loss may be required if future events cause a decrease in the indicated fair value of these assets 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
if these estimates and assumptions change  we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected taxable income  statutory tax rates and tax credits allowed in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in interim reporting periods  we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate based on the facts available at the time 
changes in the mix or estimated amount of annual pre tax income could impact our estimated effective tax rate in interim periods 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our results of operations  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the interim period the unusual or one time item occurred 
the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ie  our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the expense in our statements of income 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return  but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million as of december  and million as of december   including valuation allowances of million as of december  and million as of december  the valuation allowances relate to canadian operating loss carryforwards which we do not expect to realize 

table of contents on january   we adopted fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the new standard defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
further information regarding the impact of adopting this new standard can be found under the caption note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was million  excluding accrued interest and penalties 
if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in our consolidated financial statements  million would affect our effective tax rate 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of december   million of interest and penalties was accrued  excluding the tax benefits of deductible interest 
examinations of our federal income tax returns for years prior to have been closed 
federal income tax returns for through have been examined by the internal revenue service irs  while our federal income tax returns for through remain subject to irs examination 
in general  income tax returns for the years through remain subject to examination by major state and city tax jurisdictions 
in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or city  all years remain subject to examination by the tax jurisdictions 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution would result in reduced income tax expense 
changes in unrecognized tax benefits during can be found under the caption note income tax provision of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
within the next months  it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will change in the range of a decrease of million to an increase of million as we attempt to settle certain federal and state matters or as federal and state statutes of limitations expire 
we are not able to predict what  if any  impact these changes may have on our effective tax rate or cash flows 
during  we reduced our income tax provision million for net accrual reversals related to settled issues  primarily resulting from the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various state income tax jurisdictions 
also during  we reduced our income tax provision million for the true up of certain deferred income tax balances

our net postretirement benefit expense was million for and million for and our business segments record postretirement benefit expense in cost of goods sold and sg a expense  based on the composition of their workforces 
our postretirement benefit expense and liability are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the expected health care cost trend rate and the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 
we analyze the assumptions used each year when we complete our actuarial valuation of the plan 
if the assumptions utilized in determining our postretirement benefit expense and liability differ from actual events  our results of operations for future periods could be impacted 

table of contents discount rate the discount rate is used to reflect the time value of money 
it is the assumed rate at which future postretirement benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate assumption is based on the rates of return on high quality  fixed income instruments currently available whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize yield curve approaches to discount each cash flow stream at an interest rate specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow 
the present value of each cash flow stream is aggregated and used to impute a weighted average discount rate 
additionally  we consider moody s high quality corporate bond rates when selecting our discount rate 
in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   we assumed a discount rate of 
a point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease our annual postretirement benefit expense by approximately million and would increase or decrease our postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets the long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for expected benefit payments 
we base this assumption on an evaluation of our historical trends and experience  taking into account current and expected market conditions 
in measuring the net postretirement benefit expense for  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
a point change in this assumption would increase or decrease our annual postretirement benefit expense by approximately million 
expected health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend rate represents the expected annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided due to factors other than changes in the demographics of plan participants 
in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   our initial health care inflation rate for was assumed to be for participants under the age of and for participants over the age of our ultimate health care inflation rate was assumed to be in and beyond for participants under the age of and in and beyond for participants over the age of a one percentage point increase in the health care inflation rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and the service and interest cost components of our annual postretirement benefit expense by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the health care inflation rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and the service and interest cost components of our annual postretirement benefit expense by million 
average remaining life expectancy of plan participants in determining the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants  our actuaries use a mortality table which includes estimated death rates for each age 
we use the rp combined healthy participant mortality table in determining this assumption 
when actual events differ from our assumptions or when we change the assumptions used  an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss results 
unrecognized gains and losses are reflected in postretirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of plan participants  which is currently years 
as of december  and  our unrecognized net actuarial loss was million and million  respectively  and was comprised of the following in thousands claims experience health care cost trend discount rate assumption return on plan assets other unrecognized net actuarial loss restructuring accruals over the past several years  we have recorded restructuring accruals as a result of facility closings and other cost management efforts 
cost management is one of our strategic objectives and we are continually seeking ways to lower our cost structure 
the acquisition of nebs resulted in even larger restructuring accruals as we combined the two companies and exited certain activities 
these accruals primarily consist of employee termination benefits payable under our ongoing severance benefit plan 
we record accruals for employee termination 
table of contents benefits when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
as such  judgment is involved in determining when it is appropriate to record restructuring accruals 
additionally  we are required to make estimates and assumptions in calculating the restructuring accruals  as many times employees choose to voluntarily leave the company prior to their termination date or they secure another position within the company 
in these situations  the employees do not receive termination benefits 
to the extent our assumptions and estimates differ from our actual costs  subsequent adjustments to restructuring accruals have been and will be required 
we reversed previously recorded restructuring accruals of million in  million in and million in primarily as a result of fewer employees receiving severance benefits than originally estimated
