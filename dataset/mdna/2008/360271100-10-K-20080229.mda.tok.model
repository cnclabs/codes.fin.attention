overview banking industry challenges there were a number of issues that the industry faced during and will continue to face in the coming months and years 
while these do not apply to all financial institutions  including the corporation  a general understanding of the operating environment for banks is helpful in understanding the corporation s financial performance in residential lending instability in the housing markets  in conjunction with increasing defaults on mortgage loans and decreasing values of residential real estate  had repercussions throughout the industry 
in addition to the contribution of changes in economic conditions  defaults were often related to higher risk subprime or non prime loans 
subprime refers to a type of mortgage that is made to borrowers with lower credit ratings who  therefore  do not qualify for loans with conventional terms  or prime loans 
rates are typically higher than prime loans to compensate lenders for the increased credit risk 
non prime refers to loans that are made to borrowers with credit characteristics that are between prime and subprime 
other defaults included loans originated with steep teaser or introductory rates that reset to market rates when the introductory period expired 
investment portfolios certain investment securities are backed by the high risk mortgage loans discussed above and the payments on such securities may not be guaranteed by a government sponsored agency 
as a result of the higher risk  the yields on these securities are typically higher than agency guaranteed mortgage backed securities 
in recent years  these securities increased in popularity as the loans underlying the securities also became more prevalent 
however  as defaults on these loans increased  the credit quality of the securities also deteriorated and many investors faced increasing credit losses 
net interest margin while not an issue limited solely to  the interest rate environment continued to present challenges to banks in maintaining and growing their net interest margin  or net interest income as a percentage of interest earning assets 
the term interest rate environment generally refers to both the level of interest rates and the shape of the u 
s 
treasury yield curve  which is a plot of the yields on treasury securities over various maturity terms 
typically  the shape of the yield curve is upward sloping  with longer term rates exceeding shorter term rates 
however  the yield curve continued to be flat during most of  meaning that there was little difference between the rates on shorter term financial instruments and those on longer term instruments 
for banks that depend on shorter term funding to invest longer term in investment securities or loans  this situation is not favorable 
beginning in september  the frb began implementing a series of decreases in short term rates to stimulate the economy 
asset quality for the past several years  the industry had been operating in an environment where credit losses and non performing assets were at historical lows 
during  due to a combination of the previously discussed residential mortgage issues and general economic conditions  the industry began to see a return to higher credit losses and higher non performing asset levels 
capital and liquidity losses from subprime lending and general credit issues have challenged many banks to maintain or grow capital to support their business 
in some cases  banks have lowered or eliminated dividends to shareholders in order to maintain capital 
these are some of the more significant factors that presented challenges to the industry during this most recent year 
the specific impact to the corporation of these and other issues are discussed throughout the overview and other sections of management s discussion  where appropriate 
summary financial results as a financial institution with a focus on traditional banking activities  the corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income  or the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and or maintaining or increasing the net interest margin  which is net interest income fully taxable equivalent as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
the corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through sales of assets  such as loans  investments  or properties 
offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans  operating expenses and income taxes 
the following table presents a summary of the corporation s earnings and selected performance ratios year ended december net income in thousands diluted net income per share return on average assets return on average equity return on average tangible equity net interest margin non performing assets to total assets calculated as net income  adjusted for intangible amortization net of tax  divided by average shareholders equity  excluding goodwill and intangible assets 
presented on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis  using a federal tax rate and statutory interest expense disallowances 
see also net interest income section of management s discussion 
the corporation s net income for decreased million  or  from due to an increase in other expenses of million  or  an increase in the provision for loan losses of million  or  and a million  or  decrease in other income  offset by a million  or  decrease in income tax expense and a million  or  increase in net interest income 
the increase in other expenses was primarily due to million in charges for contingent losses related to the corporation s mortgage banking operations at resource bank resource mortgage 
the increase in the provision for loan losses was due to an increased estimate of losses inherent in the corporation s loan portfolio  driven in part by an increase in the level of net charge offs and non performing loans in in comparison to the decrease in income tax expense was due to a decrease in income before income taxes in as well as a decrease in the effective tax rate 
the net interest income increase was driven by average balance sheet growth  partially offset by a basis point decline in net interest margin 
net interest margin decreased as a result of funding loan growth with borrowings and time deposits as opposed to lower cost core demand and savings accounts 
residential lending residential mortgages are originated and sold by the corporation through three channels fulton mortgage company fulton mortgage  which is a division of each of the corporation s subsidiary banks  excluding resource bank and the columbia bank  the columbia bank  which maintains its own mortgage lending operations  and resource mortgage  which is a division of resource bank 
fulton mortgage primarily originates prime loans that conform to published standards of government sponsored agencies  including the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
such loans are typically sold to these agencies  if servicing is retained by the corporation  or to other investors  if servicing is released 
for loans underwritten to agency standards  recourse risk or the requirement to repurchase these loans in the event of borrower default is minimal 
a much less significant portion of fulton mortgage s volume is originated under other investor programs  which do not conform to agency standards and  therefore  carry a somewhat higher recourse risk 
depending on balance sheet management decisions  some originated loans are held in portfolio 
these loans would typically be adjustable rate loans  to minimize interest rate risk 
total loans sold by fulton mortgage in and were million and million  respectively 
of this volume  less than of total loans sold was considered to be non prime for both and there were no losses incurred on loan repurchases by fulton mortgage in or the columbia bank sold residential mortgages totaling million and million in and  respectively 
as with fulton mortgage  the vast majority of these loans sold were prime loans that conformed to published standards of government sponsored agencies 
there were no losses incurred on loan repurchases by the columbia bank in or resource mortgage operated a significant national wholesale mortgage lending operation from the time the corporation acquired resource bank in through early loans were originated and sold under various investor programs  including some that allowed for reduced documentation and or no verification of certain borrower qualifications  such as income or assets 
while few of the loans originated and sold by resource mortgage were considered to be subprime  significant volumes of non prime loans were originated and sold 
total loans sold by resource mortgage in and were million and billion  respectively 
of this volume  less than of total loans sold in was considered non prime  compared to approximately in loans sold under these non prime investor programs included standard representations and warranties regarding the origination of the loans  as well as standard agreements to repurchase loans under specified circumstances  including early payment defaults by the borrowers or evidence of misrepresentation of borrower information 
during  the general market for these alternative loan products across the country had declined due to moderating real estate prices  increased payment defaults by borrowers and increased loan foreclosures 
as a result  resource mortgage experienced an increase in requests from secondary market purchasers to repurchase loans sold to those investors 
these repurchase requests resulted in the corporation recording million of charges during these charges  included in operating risk loss on the corporation s consolidated statements of income  represented the write downs that were necessary to reduce the loan balances to their estimated net realizable values  based on valuations of the properties  as adjusted for market factors and other considerations 
operating risk loss consists of losses incurred during the normal conduct of banking operations 
many of the loans the corporation repurchased or that may be repurchased are delinquent and will likely be settled through foreclosure and sale of the underlying collateral 
the following table presents a summary of approximate principal balances and related reserves write downs recognized on the corporation s consolidated balance sheet  by general category december  reserves principal write downs in thousands outstanding repurchase requests no repurchase request received sold loans with identified potential misrepresentations of borrower information repurchased loans foreclosed real estate oreo other n a total reserves write downs at december  principal balances had not been repurchased and  therefore  are not included on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  reserve balance included as a component of other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  principal balances  net of write downs  are included as a component of loans  net of unearned income on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  during  approximately million of loans held for sale were reclassified to portfolio because there was no longer an active secondary market for these types of loans 
the write down amount adjusts these loans to lower of cost or market upon transfer to portfolio 
of the million of repurchased loans outstanding as of december   approximately million were classified as non performing loans  net of write downs 
the following presents the change in the reserve write down balances for the year ended december  in thousands total reserves write downs  beginning of year additional charges to expense charge offs total reserves write downs  end of year included in the million of charges recorded in was million of losses for two unrelated groups of loans totaling million for which management identified potential misrepresentations of borrower information 
as of december   the corporation had received repurchase requests for million of these loans 
in addition   of these loans were originated for sale  but later transferred to portfolio 
in order to limit additional losses associated with the potential repurchase of previously originated and sold residential mortgage loans and home equity loans  the corporation exited the national wholesale residential mortgage business at resource mortgage  where the majority of the repurchased loans were generated 
in addition  in the third quarter of  resource bank  including resource mortgage  began reporting directly to fulton bank  and the corporation intends to legally merge resource into fulton bank in the first quarter of see note a  significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details of bank subsidiary consolidations 
during the third quarter of  the audit committee of the corporation s board of directors engaged outside counsel to review whether there were additional potentially material occurrences of misrepresentations of borrower information that should be considered in determining the level of loss reserves 
the investigation involved sampling and analyzing data on loans originated by resource mortgage  examining underlying loan documentation on selected loans identified as a result of this analysis together with other records of the corporation  and conducting interviews of relevant employees 
based on the results of the review  completed in november  the audit committee and management concluded that no changes to the consolidated financial statements were necessary as of the end of the third quarter of management believes that the reserves recorded as of december  for the known resource mortgage issues are adequate  based on the results of the aforementioned review  the assessment of collateral values and other market factors 
however  continued declines in collateral values or the identification of additional loans to be repurchased could necessitate additional reserves in the future 
investment portfolio the corporation s investment strategy for debt securities has historically been conservative  to minimize potential credit losses 
mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations in the portfolio are generally guaranteed by government sponsored agencies  minimizing the amount of principal at risk of loss 
during  the corporation sold million of collateralized mortgage obligations  which were not agency guaranteed securities  for a total loss of  as a result of these sales  as of december   the investment portfolio includes only mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations whose timely principal payments are guaranteed by government sponsored agencies 
net interest margin changes in the interest rate environment can impact both the corporation s net interest income and its non interest income 
during and for a majority of  the yield curve was relatively flat and  at times  downward sloping  with minimal differences between long and short term rates  negatively impacting the corporation s net interest income and net interest margin 
during the fourth quarter of  the yield curve began to steepen slightly as a result of decreases in short term interest rates 
however  for durations of seven years or less which is the term of the majority of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities there remained little difference in yields 
the following graph shows the u 
s 
treasury yield curves at the end of each of the last three years line graph the corporation s net interest margin was negatively impacted due to the corporation funding loan growth and investment purchases with higher cost short term borrowings and time deposits as opposed to lower cost savings and demand deposits 
the corporation experienced a basis point increase in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities from in to in as compared to a basis point increase in the yield on average interest earning assets from in to in 
as a result  the net interest margin decreased basis points on an annual basis and trended downward throughout much of and  as shown in the following table 
st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter year to date floating rate loans  short term borrowings and savings and time deposit rates are generally influenced by short term rates 
during  the federal reserve board frb lowered the overnight borrowing  or federal funds  rate three times  for a total decrease of basis points since december   ending at 
the corporation s prime lending rate had a corresponding decrease  from to  resulting in a decrease in the rates on floating rate loans as well as the rates on new fixed rate loans 
in addition  the decrease in short term rates also resulted in decreased funding costs  with short term borrowings immediately repricing to lower rates 
deposit rates also decreased  although to a lesser degree as practical limits exist on how low such rates can decline before they would no longer be attractive to depositors  relative to rates paid by competitors of the corporation 
in january  the frb lowered the federal funds rate an additional basis points 
the market risk section of management s discussion summarizes the expected impact of rate changes on net interest income 
asset quality asset quality refers to the underlying credit characteristics of borrowers and the likelihood that defaults on contractual loan payments will result in charge offs of account balances  which  in turn  result in provisions for loan losses recorded on the consolidated statements of income 
by its nature  risk in lending cannot be completely eliminated  but it can be controlled and managed through proper underwriting policies  effective collection procedures and risk management activities 
external factors  such as economic conditions  which cannot be controlled by the corporation  will always have some effect on asset quality  regardless of the strength of an organization s control policies and procedures 
the corporation has historically been able to maintain strong asset quality through different economic cycles and  in recent years  asset quality measures  such as net charge offs to average loans and non performing assets to total assets  have been at historically low levels 
during  these measures began to return to more normal levels as a result of economic factors and their impact on the overall lending environment  but also as a result of the repurchase of resource mortgage loans  almost all of which were placed on non accrual status or were foreclosed and recorded in other real estate owned 
at december   total non performing assets were million  or of total assets 
this represented an increase of million  or  from million at december  the resource mortgage repurchased loans increased non performing assets by approximately million at december   or of total assets 
management believes that its policies and procedures for managing asset quality are sound 
however  there can be no assurance about maintaining strong asset quality in the future 
continuing decreases in the values of underlying collateral or negative trends in general economic conditions could have a detrimental impact on borrowers ability to repay their loans 
capital and liquidity despite the decrease in net income in  the corporation s capital levels remain strong 
at december   total leverage  tier risk based and total risk based capital  as defined in banking regulations  were  and  respectively  as compared to  and  respectively  at december  these ratios continue to exceed the minimum required to be considered well capitalized under the regulations 
in addition  from a liquidity standpoint  the parent company and its subsidiary banks have access to sufficient funding sources to support operations 
the corporation has no plans to raise additional capital at this time 
equity markets as disclosed in the market risk section of management s discussion  equity valuations can have an impact on the corporation s financial performance 
in particular  bank stocks account for a significant portion of the corporation s equity investment portfolio 
economic uncertainty surrounding the financial institution sector as a whole has impacted the value of the corporation s financial institutions stock portfolio 
historically  gains on sales of these equities have been a recurring component of the corporation s earnings 
however  recent declines in values have resulted in decreases in realized investment securities gains 
during  the corporation s net gains on investment securities sales decreased million  or  with million of the decrease attributable to bank stocks 
as of december   the corporation s bank stock portfolio had a net unrealized loss of million  compared to a net unrealized loss of  at december  these declines in bank stock portfolio values may impact the corporation s ability to realize gains in the future 
expense control through consolidation and centralization during and  the corporation continued to implement changes to its operating structure to improve expense efficiency 
specifically  a number of subsidiary bank consolidations were completed 
in december  the former premier bank subsidiary was consolidated with fulton bank 
in february  the former first washington state bank subsidiary was consolidated with the bank 
in may  the former somerset valley bank subsidiary was consolidated with skylands community bank 
in july  the former lebanon valley farmers bank subsidiary was consolidated with fulton bank 
the corporation also plans to complete the consolidation of resource bank with fulton bank in the first quarter of  at which time the total number of subsidiary banks will have decreased from to the consolidated banks retain the local autonomy and decision making that has long been the corporation s operating model 
however  by combining these banks  additional resources are available to customers in their markets  and overlapping functions are eliminated 
during  the corporation also completed a workforce management initiative which resulted in the centralization of a number of fragmented back office functions  including finance  human resources and marketing  among others 
a separate initiative in the branch system further reduced staffing and the related expense 
the result of these initiatives  plus staffing decreases at resource mortgage mainly due to exiting the national wholesale residential mortgage business  was a decrease of full time equivalent employees  to  at december  from  at december  average full time equivalent employees decreased to  in from  in this decrease in employees will continue to benefit the corporation through lower salary and benefits costs in the future 
acquisitions the corporation has historically supplemented its internal growth with strategic acquisitions  primarily of high quality community banks operating in desirable markets 
upon acquisition  acquired organizations generally retain their status as separate legal entities unless consolidation with an existing subsidiary bank is practical  as was the case in the consolidations discussed in the previous section 
during  the corporation did not consummate or announce any bank acquisitions  as few opportunities meeting the corporation s requirements of a comparable corporate culture  strong performance and sound asset quality in high growth markets were available 
in addition  the prices being sought in many cases exceeded management s estimate of value 
the corporation will continue to focus on generating growth in the most cost effective manner 
results of operations in february  the corporation acquired columbia bancorp columbia  of columbia  maryland  a billion bank holding company whose primary subsidiary was the columbia bank 
results for in comparison to were impacted by a full year contribution by columbia in  compared to an eleven month contribution in in july  the corporation acquired svb financial services  inc svb of somerville  new jersey  a million bank holding company whose primary subsidiary was somerset valley bank 
results for in comparison to were impacted by both the columbia and svb acquisitions 
net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of the corporation s net income 
the ability to manage net interest income over changing interest rate and economic environments is important to the success of a financial institution 
growth in net interest income is generally dependent upon balance sheet growth and or maintaining or increasing the net interest margin 
the market risk section of management s discussion provides additional information on the policies and procedures used by the corporation to manage net interest income 
the following table provides a comparative average balance sheet and net interest income analysis for compared to and interest income and yields are presented on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis  using a federal tax rate and statutory interest expense disallowances

net interest income increased million  or  from million in to million in due to an increase in average interest earning assets  offset by a decline in net interest margin 
average interest earning assets grew  from billion in to billion in interest income increased million  or  primarily as a result of an increase in average interest earning assets  which contributed million to the increase  with the remaining growth in interest income due to the basis point  or  increase in average rates on interest earning assets 
columbia contributed approximately million to the increase in average interest earning assets 
the increase in average interest earning assets was primarily due to loan growth 
average loans increased by million  or  to billion in the following table presents the growth in average loans  net of unearned income  by type increase decrease dollars in thousands commercial industrial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial mortgage real estate residential mortgage real estate home equity real estate construction consumer leasing and other total loan growth was particularly strong in the commercial loan and commercial mortgage categories  which together increased million  or  with columbia contributing approximately million to the increase 
the remaining growth in commercial loans was across all commercial loan types  and throughout most subsidiary banks and geographical regions 
the remaining growth in commercial mortgages was primarily in adjustable rate mortgages 
the increases in residential mortgage loans of million  or  was due to growth in adjustable rate mortgage loans million  or a increase and the impact of the million of repurchased resource mortgage loans outstanding as of december  additional increases in loans were due to increases in construction loans of million  or  and home equity loans of million  or 
columbia contributed approximately million and million to the increases in construction loans and home equity loans  respectively 
the remaining increase in home equity loans was due to the repurchase of resource mortgage loans during and the introduction of a blended fixed floating rate product in late offsetting these increases was a million  or  decrease in average consumer loans 
the corporation s indirect automobile portfolio decreased million  or  while growth in credit card outstandings of million  or  somewhat offset this decline 
the average yield on loans during of represented a basis point  or  increase in comparison to the increase in the average yield on loans reflected a higher average rate environment  as illustrated by a higher average prime rate in as compared to 
average loans held for sale decreased million  or  as a result of lower volumes mainly due to the exit from the national wholesale mortgage business 
average investments decreased million  or  while the average yield on investment securities increased basis points from in to in the increase in yield was primarily attributable to the corporation s systematic reinvestment of normal portfolio cash flows  primarily from lower duration  significantly lower yielding balloon mortgage backed securities  into a combination of higher yielding mortgage backed pass through securities  conservative collateralized mortgage obligations  as well as longer term municipal securities 
also contributing to the increase in yield was a reduction in premium amortization  which is accounted for as an offset to interest income  from million in to million in the decrease in amortization reflects the cumulative impact of initiatives to reduce the premium levels of mortgage backed securities purchased during and and stable prepayment experience on relatively short duration mortgage backed securities purchased prior to that period 
the increase in interest income was offset by an increase in interest expense of million  or  to million in from million in interest expense increased million due to a million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities and million due to a basis point  or  increase in the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities primarily resulted from a change in deposit composition as non interest bearing demand and lower cost savings and money market deposits shifted toward higher cost certificates of deposit 
columbia contributed approximately million to the increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
the following table summarizes the change in average deposits  by type increase decrease dollars in thousands noninterest bearing demand interest bearing demand savings money market time deposits total the time deposit increase of million was due to normal growth and existing customers shifting funds from noninterest bearing and interest bearing demand and savings accounts to time deposits to take advantage of higher rates 
the net decrease in demand and savings accounts of million  or  was net of an approximately million increase related to the columbia acquisition 
growing core deposits continued to be a challenge for the corporation  and banks in general  as more attractive investment opportunities existed for consumers over the past two years  including equity markets and higher yielding time deposits 
the following table summarizes the changes in average borrowings  by type increase decrease dollars in thousands short term borrowings customer repurchase agreements short term promissory notes federal funds purchased other short term borrowings total short term borrowings long term debt fhlb advances other long term debt total long term debt total borrowings during  the corporation obtained additional funding  primarily as a result of loan growth  through an increase in borrowings 
average borrowings increased million  or  during  with columbia contributing approximately million to the increase 
the million  or  decrease in short term borrowings was mainly due to a decrease in federal funds purchased  offset by a net increase of million  or  in short term promissory notes and customer repurchase agreements 
average long term debt increased million  or  to billion 
the increase in long term debt was primarily due to increases in federal home loan bank fhlb advances as longer term rates were locked and durations were extended to manage interest rate risk  and partially due to the may issuance of million of ten year subordinated notes 
on an ending balance basis  however  short term borrowings increased million  or  as continued growth in loans and investments during the latter part of required additional funding that could not be generated by deposit growth 
see further discussion in the financial condition section of management s discussion 
vs 
net interest income increased million  or  from million in to million in  primarily as a result of increases in average balances of interest earning assets and partially as a result of increases in rates 
average interest earning assets grew  from billion in to billion in  with acquisitions contributing approximately billion to this increase 
interest income increased million  or  primarily as a result of the increase in average interest earning assets  which contributed million of the increase  with the remaining growth in interest income due to the basis point  or  increase in average rates on interest earning assets 
average loans  net of unearned income increased by billion  or  to billion in acquisitions contributed approximately billion to this increase in average balances 
loan growth was strong in the commercial mortgage and construction categories  which together increased million  or  over commercial loans grew million  or  in comparison to residential mortgage and home equity loans increased million  or  in comparison to due to promotional efforts and customers using home equity loans as a cost effective refinance alternative 
the average yield on loans during of represented an basis point  or  increase in comparison to this increase reflected the impact of a significant portfolio of floating rate loans  which repriced as interest rates rose  as they did in  and the addition of higher yielding new loans 
average investments increased million  or  in comparison to  with acquisitions contributing million 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  the investment balances increased million  or 
during the second half of  the corporation pre purchased approximately million of investment securities  based on expected cash inflows from maturities of investments over the subsequent six month period 
these were funded by a combination of short and longer term borrowings  a portion of which have been repaid with maturities of investments  while the remaining portion was repaid during the average yield on investment securities improved basis points to in from in the increase was due to the maturity of lower yielding investments  with reinvestment at higher rates 
also contributing to the increase was a reduction in premium amortization  which is accounted for as a reduction of interest income  from million in to million in  due to both a reduction in premiums on purchases of mortgage backed securities in and due to decreased prepayments on mortgage backed securities as interest rates rose 
the increase in interest income was offset by an increase in interest expense of million  or  to million in from million in the increase in interest expense was primarily due to a basis point  or  increase in the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities in in comparison to the remaining increase in interest expense was due to a billion  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities  partially due to acquisitions and partially due to internal growth 
the corporation experienced significant growth in certificates of deposit of million  or  as a result of the frb s rate increases during  making them an attractive investment alternative for customers and due to acquisitions contributing million 
the change in the composition of deposits contributed to the basis point  or  increase in the average cost of interest bearing deposits in comparison to average borrowings increased million  or  during  with acquisitions contributing million 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  average short term borrowings increased million  or  to billion 
the increase in short term borrowings was mainly due to an increase in federal funds purchased to fund loan growth  offset slightly by lower borrowings outstanding under customer repurchase agreements 
average long term debt increased million  or  to billion  with acquisitions contributing million 
the additional increase in long term debt was primarily due to the issuance of million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures in january  the impact of million of subordinated debt issued and outstanding since march and additional fhlb advances 
provision and allowance for credit losses the corporation accounts for the credit risk associated with lending activities through its allowance for credit losses and provision for loan losses

the amount of interest income on non accrual loans that was included in income was approximately million 
accrual of interest is generally discontinued when a loan becomes days past due as to principal and interest 
when interest accruals are discontinued  interest credited to income is reversed

the allocation is based on risk factors  collateral levels  economic conditions and other relevant factors  as appropriate 
the corporation also maintains an unallocated allowance  which was approximately at december  the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions that might exist at the balance sheet date  but are not specifically identifiable 
management believes such an unallocated allowance is reasonable and appropriate as the estimates used in the allocation process are inherently imprecise 
see additional disclosures in note a  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and critical accounting policies  in management s discussion 
management believes that the allowance for loan loss balance of million at december  is sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio on that date and is appropriate based on applicable accounting standards

increases in residential mortgage loans of million  or  and in home equity loans of million  or  also contributed to the increase in loans 
the growth in these types of loans resulted from originations of adjustable rate mortgages for portfolio and the repurchase of loans by resource mortgage 
approximately billion  or  of the corporation s loan portfolio was in commercial mortgage and construction loans at december   compared to at december  while the corporation does not have a concentration of credit risk with any single borrower or industry  repayments on loans in these portfolios can be negatively influenced by decreases in real estate values 
the corporation mitigates this risk through stringent underwriting policies and procedures

the increase over reflects the pre purchase of investments with cash proceeds that are expected to be received over the next six months  generally from us government sponsored agency mortgage backed securities 
this allowed the corporation to obtain rates more favorable than those expected in the near future 
the corporation classified of its investment portfolio as available for sale at december  and  as such  these investments were recorded at their estimated fair values 
the net unrealized loss on non equity available for sale investment securities decreased from million at december  to million at december   generally due to changes in interest rates 
at december   equity securities consisted of fhlb and other government agency stock million  stocks of other financial institutions million and mutual funds and other million 
historically  the financial institutions stock portfolio was a source of capital appreciation and realized gains million in  million in and million in 
however  this portfolio has experienced recent declines in value consistent with the industry as a whole  and as of december   the portfolio has net unrealized losses of million 
management evaluated the near term prospects of the issuers in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment 
based on that evaluation and the corporation s ability and intent to hold those investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a recovery of fair value  the corporation does not consider those investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  as of december   the corporation did not have any collateralized debt obligations in its investment portfolio  and all of its mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations were government sponsored agency guaranteed 
other assets cash and due from banks increased million  or 
because of the daily fluctuations that result in the normal course of business  cash is more appropriately analyzed in terms of average balances 
on an average balance basis  cash and due from banks decreased million  or  from million in to million in other earning assets decreased million  or  primarily due to a million  or  decrease in loans held for sale 
the decrease in loans held for sale was due to an increase in average longer term mortgage rates during and the first half of and the exit from the national wholesale residential mortgage business at resource mortgage

the decrease was due primarily to million of amortization expense related to intangible assets  and million of trade name intangible asset write offs recorded in see also note f  goodwill and intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other assets increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily due to a million increase in other real estate owned  due to the resource mortgage loan repurchases  a million increase in the deferred tax asset due to the reserve for resource mortgage loans which may be repurchased  and an increase of million related to a reclassification of the overfunded status of the corporation s defined benefit pension plan  which was curtailed in april these increases were offset by a million decrease in receivables related to investment security sales and maturities 
see also note l  employee benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the corporation s curtailment of the defined benefit pension plan 
deposits and borrowings deposits decreased million  or  to billion at december  during  total demand deposits decreased million  or  savings deposits decreased million  or  and time deposits increased million  or 
the increase in time deposits resulted from the price sensitivity of customers who have taken advantage of favorable interest rates offered on time deposits 
short term borrowings increased million  or  primarily due to a million increase in overnight fhlb advances and partially due to a million increase in short term promissory notes and customer repurchase agreements 
long term debt increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in fhlb advances to fund loan growth and investment purchases  as well as the corporation s issuance of million of ten year subordinated notes in may as a result of decreases in demand and savings deposits  in late the corporation increased its variable rate funding in the form of short term borrowings to support continued loan growth and to fund investment securities purchases 
this is in contrast to the trend of lower reliance on short term borrowings which occurred throughout the second half of and the first half of  which resulted in a decrease in short term borrowings on an annual average basis  as shown in the net interest income section of management s discussion 
other liabilities other liabilities increased million  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in accrued interest payable related to the increase in time deposit balances  a million increase in the reserve for potential repurchases of residential mortgage loans and home equity loans sold by resource mortgage  and a million increase related to the corporation s reclassification of its reserve for unfunded commitments from the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities as of december  shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased million  or  to billion  or of ending total assets  as of december  this growth was due primarily to net income of million  a million reversal of other comprehensive loss due to the curtailment of the defined benefit pension plan  an increase of million related to unrealized holding gains on investment securities  and million of stock issuances 
these increases were offset by million of dividends paid to shareholders and million of treasury stock purchases 
total treasury stock purchases were approximately million shares in  million shares in and million shares in the corporation had a stock repurchase plan in place for million shares which expired on december  through december    shares had been repurchased under this plan 
the dividend payout ratio  or dividends per share divided by diluted net income per share  of in increased from in this growth reflects a lower net income level  while maintaining a consistent dividend rate 
the corporation and its subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by various banking regulators 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
the regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and tier i capital to average assets as defined 
as of december   the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries met the minimum capital requirements 
in addition  all of the corporation s bank subsidiaries capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in the regulations

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has various financial obligations that require future cash payments 
these obligations include the payment of liabilities recorded on the corporation s consolidated balance sheet as well as contractual obligations for purchased services or for operating leases

variable obligations  such as those based on transaction volumes  are not included 
in addition to the contractual obligations listed in the preceding table  the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the financial or performance obligation of a customer to a third party 
commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash needs as they may expire without being drawn 
the following table presents the corporation s commitments to extend credit and letters of credit as of december  in thousands commercial mortgage  construction and land development home equity credit card commercial and other total commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit total letters of credit critical accounting policies the following is a summary of those accounting policies that the corporation considers to be most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  as they require management s most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowance for credit losses the corporation accounts for the credit risk associated with its lending activities through the allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents management s estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments  the balance of which is included in other liabilities 
the provision for loan losses is the periodic charge to earnings  which is necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to its proper balance 
the corporation assesses the adequacy of its allowance through a methodology that consists of the following identifying loans for individual review under statement in general  these consist of large balance commercial loans and commercial mortgages that are rated less than satisfactory based upon the corporation s internal credit rating process 
assessing whether the loans identified for review under statement are impaired 
that is  whether it is probable that all amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
for loans reviewed under statement  calculating the estimated fair value  using observable market prices  discounted cash flows or the value of the underlying collateral 
classifying all non impaired large balance loans based on credit risk ratings and allocating an allowance for loan losses based on appropriate factors  including recent loss history for similar loans 
identifying all smaller balance homogeneous loans for evaluation collectively under the provisions of statement in general  these loans include residential mortgages  consumer loans  installment loans  smaller balance commercial loans and mortgages and lease receivables 
statement loans are segmented into groups with similar characteristics and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on recent loss history and other relevant information 
reviewing the results to determine the appropriate balance of the allowance for credit losses 
this review gives additional consideration to factors such as the mix of loans in the portfolio  the balance of the allowance relative to total loans and non performing assets  trends in the overall risk profile of the portfolio  trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans and local and national economic conditions 
an unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the inherent imprecision in estimating and measuring loss exposure 
documenting the results of its review in accordance with sab the allowance review methodology is based on information known at the time of the review 
changes in factors underlying the assessment could have a material impact on the amount of the allowance that is necessary and the amount of provision to be charged against earnings 
such changes could impact future results 
accounting for business combinations the corporation accounts for all business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations statement 
purchase accounting requires the purchase price to be allocated to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
it also requires assessing the existence of and  if necessary  assigning a value to certain intangible assets 
the remaining excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the purchase price is established as the value of securities issued for the acquisition  cash consideration paid and certain acquisition related expenses 
the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are typically established through appraisals  observable market values or discounted cash flows 
management has engaged independent third party valuation experts to assist in valuing certain assets  particularly intangibles 
other assets and liabilities are generally valued using the corporation s internal asset liability modeling system 
the assumptions used and the final valuations  whether prepared internally or by a third party  are reviewed by management 
due to the complexity of purchase accounting  final determinations of values can be time consuming and  occasionally  amounts included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income are based on preliminary estimates of value 
goodwill and intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives 
some intangible assets have indefinite lives and are  therefore  not amortized 
all intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment if certain events occur 
any impairment write downs are recognized as expense on the consolidated statements of income 
goodwill is not amortized to expense  but is evaluated at least annually for impairment 
the corporation completes its annual goodwill impairment test as of october st of each year 
the corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities  as necessary  to defined reporting units 
a fair value is then determined for each reporting unit 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of the recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair values are less than the book values  an additional valuation procedure is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
the corporation determined that no impairment write offs were necessary during  and business unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates for the reporting units  selection of comparable market transactions  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance and cash flow projections could result in different assessments of the fair values of reporting units and could result in impairment charges in the future 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  an impairment test between annual tests is necessary 
such events may include adverse changes in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse actions by a regulator  unauthorized competition  the loss of key employees  or similar events 
the corporation has not performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the past three years as no such events have occurred 
however  such an interim test could be necessary in the future 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon income before income taxes  adjusted for the effect of certain tax exempt income and non deductible expenses 
in addition  certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate 
the corporation must also evaluate the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if any such assets are more likely than not to not be recovered  a valuation allowance must be recognized 
the corporation recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  for certain state net operating losses that are not expected to be recovered 
the assessment of the carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on certain assumptions  changes in which could have a material impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments 
the types of market risk exposures generally faced by financial institutions include interest rate risk  equity market price risk  foreign currency risk and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only equity market price risk and interest rate risk are significant to the corporation 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of equity investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation s equity investments consist of common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions  us government sponsored agency stocks and money market mutual funds 
the equity investments most susceptible to equity market price risk are the financial institutions stocks  which had a cost basis of approximately million and a fair value of million at december  gross unrealized gains and losses in this portfolio were approximately  and million at december   respectively 
although the carrying value of the financial institutions stocks accounted for only of the corporation s total assets  the corporation has a history of realizing gains from this portfolio 
however  significant declines in the values of financial institution stocks held in this portfolio have reduced the likelihood of realizing significant gains in the near term 
in addition  if the values of the stocks held in this portfolio continue to decline and there is an indication that the decline is other than temporary  the corporation may be required to write down the values of financial institution stocks in the future  depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the decrease in the fair value of each individual financial institution s stock 
management continuously monitors the fair value of its equity investments and evaluates current market conditions and operating results of the companies 
periodic sale and purchase decisions are made based on this monitoring process 
none of the corporation s equity securities are classified as trading 
future cash flows from these investments are not provided in the table on page as such investments do not have maturity dates 
the corporation has evaluated  based on existing accounting guidance  whether any unrealized losses on individual equity investments constituted other than temporary impairment  which would require a write down through a charge to earnings 
based on the results of such evaluations  the corporation recorded write downs of  in   in and  in for specific equity securities which were deemed to exhibit other than temporary impairment in value 
additional impairment charges may be necessary depending upon the performance of the equity markets in general and the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation

in addition to its equity portfolio  the corporation s investment management and trust services revenue could be impacted by fluctuations in the securities markets 
a portion of the corporation s trust revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios 
if securities values decline  the corporation s revenue could be negatively impacted 
in addition  the ability of the corporation to sell its equities brokerage services is dependent  in part  upon consumers level of confidence in the outlook for rising securities prices 
interest rate risk  asset liability management and liquidity interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas 
first  changes in rates have an impact on the corporation s liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow 
second  movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s net interest income and changes in the economic value of its equity 
the corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of key financial and senior management personnel  meets on a bi weekly basis 
the alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation  approving asset and liability management policies  and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions and earnings 
the primary goal of asset liability management is to address the liquidity and net interest income risks noted above 
from a liquidity standpoint  the corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the cash needs of its customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments and through the availability of deposits and borrowings 
the corporation also maintains secondary sources that provide liquidity on a secured and unsecured basis to meet short term needs 
the corporation s sources and uses of cash were discussed in general terms in the overview section of management s discussion 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide additional information 
the corporation generated million in cash from operating activities during  mainly due to net income and the proceeds from the sales of mortgage loans held for sale exceeding the originations of mortgage loans held for sale 
investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of billion in due to the purchase of investment securities and the net increase in loans exceeding the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
financing activities resulted in net cash proceeds of million in  compared to net cash proceeds of million in as net funds provided by additions of long tern debt and short term borrowings and increases in time deposits exceeded repayments of long term debt  decreases in demand and savings accounts  and shareholder dividends 
liquidity must also be managed at the fulton financial corporation parent company level 
for safety and soundness reasons  banking regulations limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from subsidiary banks to the parent company in the form of loans and dividends 
generally  these limitations are based on the subsidiary banks regulatory capital levels and their net income 
the parent company meets its cash needs through dividends and loans from subsidiary banks  and through external borrowings 
in  the parent company entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with an unaffiliated bank 
under the terms of the agreement  the parent company can borrow up to million with interest calculated based on a short term london interbank offering rate libor repriced daily 
the credit agreement requires the corporation to maintain certain financial ratios related to capital strength and earnings 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under this agreement 
the corporation was in compliance with all required covenants under the credit agreement as of december  in may  the corporation issued million of ten year subordinated notes  which mature on may  and carry a fixed rate of  and an effective rate of approximately as a result of issuance costs 
interest is paid semi annually in may and november of each year 
in january  the corporation purchased all of the common stock of a new delaware business trust  fulton capital trust i  which was formed for the purpose of issuing million of trust preferred securities at an effective rate of approximately 
in connection with this transaction  the parent company issued million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures to the trust 
these debentures carry the same rate and mature on february  in  the corporation issued million of ten year subordinated notes  which mature april  and carry a fixed rate of and an effective rate of as a result of issuance costs 
interest is paid semi annually 
these borrowings  most notably the revolving line of credit agreement  supplement the liquidity available from subsidiaries through dividends and provide some flexibility in parent company cash management 
management continues to monitor the liquidity and capital needs of the parent company and will implement appropriate strategies  as necessary  to remain well capitalized and to meet its cash needs 
at december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  federal funds sold  mortgages available for sale  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled billion  or of total assets 
this level of liquid assets compares to billion  or of total assets  at december  the following tables present the expected maturities of investment securities at december  and the weighted average yields of such securities calculated based on historical cost held to maturity at amortized cost maturing after one but after five but within one year within five years within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government sponsored agency securities state and municipal other securities total mortgage backed securities available for sale at estimated fair value maturing after one but after five but within one year within five years within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government securities us government sponsored agency securities state and municipal other securities total collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities weighted average yields on tax exempt securities have been computed on a fully tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of and statutory interest expense disallowances 
maturities for mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are dependent upon the interest rate environment and prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  the entire balance and weighted average rate is shown in one period 
includes small business administration securities  whose maturities are dependent upon prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  amounts are based upon contractual maturities 
the corporation s investment portfolio consists mainly of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations which have stated maturities that may differ from actual maturities due to borrowers ability to prepay obligations 
cash flows from such investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans  and are generally influenced by the level of interest rates 
as rates increase  cash flows generally decrease as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans decrease 
as rates decrease  cash flows generally increase as prepayments increase 
the following table presents the approximate contractual maturity and interest rate sensitivity of certain loan types  excluding consumer loans and leases  subject to changes in interest rates as of december  one one year through more than or less five years five years total in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural floating rate fixed rate total real estate mortgage floating rate fixed rate total real estate construction floating rate fixed rate total from a funding standpoint  even though the corporation has experienced notable changes in the composition and interest sensitivity of its core deposit base  it has been able to rely on this base to provide needed liquidity 
in addition  the corporation issues certificates of deposits in various denominations  including jumbo time deposits  repurchase agreements and short term borrowings as potential sources of liquidity 
contractual maturities of time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  are as follows in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months total each of the corporation s subsidiary banks is a member of the fhlb and has access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
at december   the corporation had billion in overnight and term advances outstanding from the fhlb with an additional million of borrowing capacity including both short term funding on its lines of credit and long term borrowings 
this availability  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity 
the following table provides information about the corporation s interest rate sensitive financial instruments

line of credit amounts are based on historical cash flow assumptions  with an average life of approximately years 
the preceding table and discussion addressed the liquidity implications of interest rate risk and focused on expected cash flows from financial instruments 
expected maturities  however  do not necessarily reflect the net interest income impact of interest rate changes 
certain financial instruments  such as adjustable rate loans  have repricing periods that differ from expected cash flows 
fair market value adjustments related to acquisitions are not included in the preceding table 
in addition to the interest rate sensitive financial instruments included in the preceding table  the corporation also had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million as of december  these swaps were used to hedge certain long term fixed rate certificates of deposit 
the terms of the certificates of deposit and the interest rate swaps are similar and were committed to simultaneously 
under the terms of the swap agreements  the corporation is the fixed rate receiver and the floating rate payer generally tied to the three month libor  a common index used for setting rates between financial institutions 
the combination of the interest rate swaps and the issuance of the certificates of deposit generates long term floating rate funding for the corporation 
as of december   the corporation s weighted average receive and pay rates were and  respectively 
included within the billion of floating rate loans above  are billion  or of the total  that float with the prime interest rate  billion  or  of adjustable rate loans  and million of loans which float with other interest rates  primarily libor 
the billion of adjustable rate loans include loans that are fixed rate instruments for a certain period of time  and then convert to floating rates 
the following table presents the percentage of adjustable rate loans  stratified by their initial fixed term percent of total adjustable rate fixed rate term loans one year two years three years four years five years greater than five years the corporation uses three complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk 
they are static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and estimates of economic value of equity 
using these measurements in tandem provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the corporation  level of risk as time evolves  and exposure to changes in interest rate relationships 
static gap provides a measurement of repricing risk in the corporation s balance sheet as of a point in time 
this measurement is accomplished through stratification of the corporation s assets and liabilities into repricing periods 
the sum of assets and liabilities in each of these periods are compared for mismatches within that maturity segment 
core deposits having no contractual maturities are placed into repricing periods based upon historical balance performance 
repricing for mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations includes the effect of expected cash flows 
estimated prepayment effects are applied to these balances based upon industry projections for prepayment speeds 
the corporation s policy limits the cumulative six month ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities rsa rsl to a range of to 
during the fourth quarter of  economic forecasts became heavily biased toward a more protracted period of declining interest rates 
as a result  the corporation undertook measures to mitigate the negative impact of declining interest rates on net interest income 
such measures included  but were not limited to  increased emphasis on shorter duration wholesale funding sources and decreased emphasis on higher rate  longer duration retail certificates of deposit 
while these efforts were successful in reducing the corporation s exposure to declining interest rates  greater than anticipated declines in retail certificates of deposits resulted in a cumulative six month gap position that was slightly outside of policy limits at december  the cumulative six month gap as of december  was a negative and the cumulative six month rsa rsl was 
by january   however  this policy exception was corrected 
it is important to note that static gap analysis does not give effect to prepayments or extensions of loans as a result of changes in general market rates 
moreover  the static gap position does not indicate the opportunities to reprice assets and liabilities within certain time frames  or account for timing differences that occur during periods of repricing 
consequently  the corportion also uses a simulation analysis to assess and manage its interest rate risk 
net interest income simulation results  as of december  indicated a very neutral position in both rising and declining interest rate environments 
the simulation analysis measures the potential change in earnings over a one year time horizon and in the economic value of portfolio equity  captures optionality factors such as call features embedded in the investment portfolio and actual or implied caps or floors embedded in loan and deposit product pricing  and includes assumptions as to the timing and magnitude of movements in interest rates associated with the corporation s variable rate funding sources 
a variety of interest rate scenarios are used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve 
these results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure the corporation s short term earnings exposure to rate movements 
the corporation s policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income to of the base case net interest income for a basis point shock in interest rates  for a basis point shock and for a basis point shock 
a shock is an immediate upward or downward movement of interest rates across the yield curve based upon changes in the prime rate 
the shocks do not take into account changes in customer behavior that could result in changes to mix and or volumes in the balance sheet nor do they account for competitive pricing over the forward month period 
the following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate shocks on net interest income annual change in net interest rate shock income change bp million bp million bp million bp million bp million bp million economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities 
upward and downward shocks of interest rates are used to determine the comparative effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment 
this measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer term repricing risks and options in the corporation s balance sheet 
a policy limit of of economic equity may be at risk for every basis point shock movement in interest rates 
as of december   the corporation was within economic value of equity policy limits
