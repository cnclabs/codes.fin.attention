item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
the company also reviews information regarding each claim for losses  including potential extra contractual liability  or amounts paid in excess of the policy limits  which may not be covered by the company s reinsurance contracts  the company s loss history and the industry s loss history  legislative enactments  judicial decisions and legal developments regarding damages  changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including inflation 
selective cannot be certain that the reserves it establishes are adequate or will be adequate in the future 
selective is subject to a variety of operational risks which could have a material adverse impact on selective s business results 
selective relies on complex financial models which have been developed internally and by third parties to analyze historical loss costs and pricing  trends in claim severity and frequency  the occurrence of catastrophe losses  and investment performance 
flaws in these financial models and or faulty assumptions used by these financial models could lead to increased losses and loss reserving 
examples of these various models are risk management solutions  the algo risk tool  and predictive modeling 
catastrophic events 
results of property and casualty insurers are subject to weather and other conditions 
while one year may be relatively free of major weather occurrences or other disasters  another year may have numerous such events  causing results to be materially worse than other years 
selective s insurance subsidiaries have experienced catastrophe losses and the company expects them to experience such losses in the future 
various natural and man made events can cause catastrophes  including  but not limited to  hurricanes  tornadoes  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  terrorism  explosions  severe winter weather  and fires  some of which may be related to climate changes 
the frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is determined by the severity of the event and the total amount of insured exposures in the area affected by the event 
although catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of property and casualty lines  most of the catastrophe related claims of selective s insurance subsidiaries historically have been related to commercial property and homeowners coverages 
selective s property and casualty insurance business is concentrated geographically in the eastern and midwestern regions of the united states 
new jersey accounts for of the company s total net premiums written 
selective s insurance subsidiaries seek to reduce their exposure to catastrophe losses through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
reinsurance  however  may prove inadequate if the modeling software used to analyze the insurance subsidiaries risk proves inadequate  a major catastrophic loss exceeds the reinsurance limit or the reinsurers financial capacity  or the frequency of catastrophe losses result in the insurance subsidiaries exceeding their one reinstatement 

table of contents the property and casualty insurance industry is cyclical 
historically  the results of the property and casualty insurance industry have experienced significant fluctuations due to economic conditions  interest rates  and other factors  such as  competition 
for example  the competitors pricing business below technical levels could force the company to reduce its profit margin in order to protect its best business 
selective has experienced the following fluctuations in commercial lines premium pricing  excluding exposure pure price  over the past several years during  pure price on commercial lines renewal business decreased  during  pure price on commercial lines renewal business decreased  during  pure price on commercial lines renewal business remained flat compared to  from  pure price on commercial lines renewal business was increasing in a range from to  and for several years prior to  selective experienced decreases in pure price in our commercial lines operations 
as an example of pricing and loss trends on the combined ratio  taking a pure price decline of and removing the expense that directly varies with premium volume yields an adverse combined ratio impact of approximately point  in addition to a claims inflation increase of  will cause the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio to increase approximately points  all else remaining equal 
the combination of claims inflation and price decreases could raise the combined ratio approximately points in this example  absent any initiatives targeted to address these trends 
the industry s profitability also is affected by unpredictable developments  including natural and man made disasters  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment that affect investment returns  inflationary pressures medical and economic that affect the size of losses  judicial  regulatory  legislative  and legal decisions that affect insurers liabilities  changes in the frequency and severity of losses  pricing and availability of reinsurance in the marketplace  and weather related impacts due to the effects of climate changes 
selective competes with regional and national property and casualty insurance companies  including public and mutual companies  some of which do not use independent agents and write directly with insureds 
many of these competitors are larger than selective and have greater financial and operating resources  as well as greater information scale 
the internet has also emerged as a significant place of new competition  both from existing competitors and from new competitors 
a new form of competition may enter the marketplace as reinsurers may attempt to diversify their insurance risk by writing business in the primary marketplace 
because selective sells its coverages through independent insurance agents who also are agents of its competitors  the company faces competition within each of its appointed independent insurance agencies 
selective also faces competition  primarily in the commercial insurance market  from entities that self insure their own risks 
many of selective s customers and potential customers are examining the benefits and risks of self insuring as an alternative to traditional insurance 
new competition from these developments could cause the supply or demand for insurance to change  which could adversely affect selective s results of operations and financial condition 
general economic conditions can adversely affect selective s business results and prospects 
changes in general economic conditions can impact selective s business 
for example  selective s contractor business represents of its insurance operations segment and is significantly impacted by changes in general economic conditions  including the downturn in the us housing market 
other economic conditions impacting selective s business include  but  are not limited to  recessions  increases in corporate  municipal and or consumer bankruptcies  changes in interest rate levels  a continued downturn in the us housing market  changes in domestic and international laws  including tax laws and bankruptcy laws  intervention by governments in financial markets  including the imposition of limits on the ability of mortgagees to foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans  wars  and terrorist acts could adversely affect the performance of the company s insured and investment portfolios  possibly leading to increases in losses and loss reserves in the insured portfolio and decreases in the value of the investment portfolio and  therefore  the company s financial strength 

table of contents acts of terrorism not covered by  or exceeding  reinsurance limits 
on november   the terrorism risk insurance act of legislation was signed into law 
this legislation was amended in december and extended through december  through the terrorism risk insurance extension act of collectively  these two acts will be referred to as tria 
on december   tria was extended for seven more years until december  this revised legislation ends the distinction between foreign and domestic acts of terrorism without increasing the level of damages necessary to trigger the program million 
this seven year period will provide the market with much needed stability 
tria requires sharing the risk of future losses from terrorism between private insurers and the federal government  and is applicable to almost all commercial lines of insurance 
insurance companies with direct commercial insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in this program 
tria rescinded all previously approved exclusions for terrorism 
policyholders for non workers compensation policies have the option to accept or decline the terrorism coverage selective offers in its policies  or negotiate other terms 
in  approximately of selective s commercial non workers compensation policyholders purchased terrorism coverage 
the terrorism coverage is mandatory for all workers compensation primary policies 
in addition   or ten of the twenty one primary states in which selective writes commercial property coverage mandate the coverage of fire following an act of terrorism 
these provisions apply to new policies written after enactment of tria 
a terrorism act must be certified by the secretary of treasury in order to be covered by tria 
each participating insurance company will be responsible for paying out a certain amount in claims a deductible before federal assistance becomes available 
this deductible  which is equal to approximately million in  is based on a percentage of commercial lines direct earned premiums for lines subject to tria from the prior calendar year 
for losses above an insurer s deductible  the federal government will cover  while the insurer contributes 
although the provisions of tria will serve to mitigate selective s exposure in the event of a large scale terrorist attack  the company s deductible is substantial 
selective s investments support its operations and provide a significant portion of its revenues and earnings 
like many other property and casualty insurance companies  selective depends on income from its investment portfolio for a significant portion of its revenues and earnings 
any significant decline in the company s investment income as a result of falling interest rates  decreased dividend payment rates  reduced returns in the company s other investment portfolio  primarily from alternative investments  or general market conditions would have an adverse effect on its results 
fluctuations in interest rates cause inverse fluctuations in the market value of the company s debt portfolio 
in addition  issuers of debt which the company holds in its investment portfolio may default in its financial obligations as a result of insolvency  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
any significant decline in the market value of its investments  excluding its held to maturity investments  would reduce the company s stockholders equity 
a significant decline in the market value of its equity and other investments would also reduce its policyholders surplus  which could impact the company s ability to write additional premiums 
in addition  selective s notes payable are subject to certain debt to capitalization restrictions  which could also be impacted by a significant decline in investment values 
for more information see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this form k 
changes in tax laws impacting marginal tax rates and or the preferred tax treatment of municipal obligations could adversely impact selective s business 
tax legislation which imposes a flat tax or otherwise changes the tax preference of municipal obligations under current law could adversely affect the market value of municipal obligations 
forty one percent of the company s investment portfolio is invested in tax exempt municipal obligations  as such  the value of the investment portfolio could be adversely affected by any such legislation 
additionally  any such changes in tax law could reduce the difference between tax exempt interest rates and taxable rates 
selective may be adversely impacted by a change in its ratings 
insurance companies are subject to financial strength ratings produced by external rating agencies  based upon factors relevant to policyholders 
ratings are not recommendations to buy  hold  or sell any of selective s securities 
higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a strong ability to pay claims 
a significant downgrade in ratings  from am best in particular  could i affect selective s ability to write new business with customers  some of whom are required under various third party agreements to maintain insurance with a carrier that maintains a specified minimum rating  ii be an event of default under selective s line of credit  or iii make it more expensive for selective to access capital markets 
selective is a holding company  and its subsidiaries may have a limited ability to declare dividends  and thus may not have access to the cash that is needed to meet its cash needs 
substantially all of selective s operations are conducted through its subsidiaries 
restrictions on the ability of the company s subsidiaries  particularly the insurance subsidiaries  to pay dividends or make other cash payments to the parent may materially affect its ability to pay principal and interest on its indebtedness and dividends on its common stock 

table of contents under the terms of selective s debt agreements and financial solvency laws affecting insurers  the company s subsidiaries are permitted to incur indebtedness up to certain levels that may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions  the payment of dividends  or the making of loans by the subsidiaries to the parent 
the company cannot assure that the agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of its subsidiaries will permit such subsidiaries to provide the parent with sufficient dividends  distributions  or loans to fund its cash needs 
sources of funds for the insurance subsidiaries primarily consist of premiums  investment income  and proceeds from sales and redemption of investments 
such funds are applied primarily to payment of claims  insurance operating expenses  income taxes and the purchase of investments  as well as dividends and other payments 
the insurance subsidiaries may declare and pay dividends to the parent only if they are permitted to do so under the insurance regulations of their respective state of domicile 
all of the states in which the insurance subsidiaries are domiciled regulate the payment of dividends 
some states  including new jersey  north carolina  and south carolina  require that selective give notice to the relevant state insurance commissioner prior to its insurance subsidiary domiciled in that respective state declaring any dividends and distributions payable to the parent 
during the notice period  the state insurance commissioner may disallow all or part of the proposed dividend upon determination that i the insurer s surplus is not reasonable in relation to its liabilities and adequate to its financial needs and those of the policyholders  or ii in the case of new jersey  the insurer is otherwise in a hazardous financial condition 
in addition  insurance regulators may block dividends or other payments to affiliates that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval upon determination that  because of the financial condition of the insurance subsidiary or otherwise  payment of a dividend or any other payment to an affiliate would be detrimental to an insurance subsidiary s policyholders or creditors 
selective s selective hr subsidiary may also declare and pay dividends  which are restricted by the operating needs of this entity as well as a professional employer organization licensing requirements to maintain a current ratio of at least selective depends on independent insurance agents and other third party service providers 
selective markets and sells its insurance products through independent  non exclusive insurance agencies and brokers 
agents and brokers are not obligated to promote selective s insurance products  and they may also sell the insurance products of the company s competitors 
as a result  selective s business depends in part on the marketing and sales efforts of these agencies and brokers 
as selective diversifies and expands its business geographically  it may need to expand its network of agencies and brokers to successfully market its products 
if these agencies and brokers fail to market selective s products successfully  its business may be adversely impacted 
also  independent agents may decide to sell their businesses to banks  other insurance agencies  or other businesses 
agents with a selective appointment may decide to buy other agents 
changes in ownership of agencies or expansion of agencies through acquisition could adversely affect an agency s ability to control growth and profitability  thereby adversely affecting selective s business 
in addition to independent insurance agents  selective also relies on third party service providers to conduct a portion of its premium audits  safety management services  and claims adjusting services 
selective s hr outsourcing business relies on third party service providers for products such as health coverage  flexible spending accounts  and k savings plans 
if these third party service providers fail to perform their respective services and or fail to provide their products successfully and or accurately  selective s business may be adversely impacted 
selective is heavily regulated in the states in which it operates 
selective is subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which the insurance subsidiaries transact insurance business 
the primary purpose of insurance regulation is to protect individual policyholders and not shareholders or other investors 
selective s business can be adversely affected by regulations affecting property and casualty insurance companies 
for example  laws and regulations can lead to mandated reductions in rates to levels that selective does not believe are adequate for the risks it insures 
other laws and regulations limit the company s ability to cancel or refuse to renew certain policies and require selective to offer coverage to all consumers 
changes in laws and regulations  or their interpretations  pertaining to insurance may also have an impact on selective s business 
selective s concentration of business may expose the company to increased risks of regulatory matters in the states in which the insurance subsidiaries write insurance that could be greater than the risks the company could be exposed to by transacting business in a greater number of geographic markets 

table of contents although the insurance industry is primarily regulated by individual states  federal initiatives  such as  the national flood insurance program  the optional federal charter  and the office of foreign assets control  can also impact the insurance industry 
proposals intended to control the cost and availability of healthcare services have been debated in the us congress and state legislatures 
although selective neither writes health insurance nor assumes any healthcare risk  rules affecting healthcare services can affect workers compensation  commercial and personal automobile  liability  and other insurance that it does write 
selective cannot determine whether  or in what form  healthcare reform legislation may be adopted by the us congress or any state legislature 
selective also cannot determine the nature and effect  if any  that the adoption of healthcare legislation or regulations  or changing interpretations  at the federal or state level would have on it 
examples of insurance regulatory risks include automobile insurance regulation in  new jersey instituted an urban enterprise zone uez program  which requires new jersey auto insurers to have a market share in certain urban territories that is in proportion to their statewide market share 
due to mandated urban rate caps  the premiums on these uez policies are typically insufficient to cover losses 
although the law that imposed these urban rate caps was repealed in  the caps continue to be enforced by the new jersey department of banking and insurance njdobi 
from time to time  legislative proposals are passed and judicial decisions are rendered related to automobile insurance regulation that could adversely affect selective s results of operations 
for example  in a new jersey supreme court decision eliminated the application of the serious life impact standard to personal automobile bodily injury liability cases under the verbal tort threshold of new jersey s automobile insurance cost reduction act aicra 
this decision allows claimants to file lawsuits for non economic damages without proving that the injuries sustained had a serious impact on their lives 
workers compensation insurance regulation because selective voluntarily writes workers compensation insurance  it is required by state law to support the involuntary market 
insurance companies that underwrite voluntary workers compensation insurance can either directly write involuntary coverage  which is assigned by state regulatory authorities  or participate in a sharing arrangement  where the business is written by a servicing carrier and the profits or losses of that serviced business are shared among the participating insurers 
selective currently participates through a sharing arrangement in all states  except new jersey  where it currently writes involuntary coverage directly 
historically  workers compensation business has been unprofitable whether written directly or handled through a sharing arrangement 
additionally  selective is required to provide workers compensation benefits for losses arising from acts of terrorism under its workers compensation policies 
the impact of any terrorist act is unpredictable  and the ultimate impact on selective will depend upon the nature  extent  location  and timing of such an act 
any such impact on selective could be material 
homeowners insurance regulation selective is subject to regulatory provisions that are designed to address potential availability and or affordability problems in the homeowners property insurance marketplace 
involuntary market mechanisms  such as the new jersey insurance underwriting association new jersey fair plan  generally result in assessments against the insurance subsidiaries 
the new jersey fair plan writes fire and extended coverage on homeowners for those individuals unable to secure insurance elsewhere 
insurance companies who voluntarily write homeowners insurance in new jersey are assessed a portion of any deficit from the new jersey fair plan based on their share of the voluntary market 
similar involuntary plans exist in most other states where selective operates 

table of contents certain coastal states have instituted  or are considering adopting  legislation or regulation to maintain or increase the availability of property insurance  particularly homeowners insurance  in those states 
for example  in florida combined its two high risk insurance pools  the windstorm and joint underwriting association  to create florida citizens property insurance corporation cpic 
cpic is a state regulated association and historically has provided property insurance to policyholders unable to obtain coverage in the private insurance market 
however  cpic has evolved from market of last resort to become the state s largest property insurer 
in may  a new insurance law passed in florida expanding the role of cpic and making its rates more competitive with the private market 
florida homeowners can now purchase coverage from cpic if the rates for a policy from a private insurer are more than higher than from a similar cpic policy 
cpic can now also offer high risk policyholders homeowners insurance as well as wind only coverage in other parts of the state  which is driving homeowners rates down in the private market 
in addition  effective january   an insurer writing homeowners insurance in another state  but not in florida  may not continue to write private passenger automobile insurance in florida unless such insurer is affiliated with an insurer writing homeowners insurance in florida 
at this time  none of selective s insurance subsidiaries write private passenger automobile insurance in florida 
certain other coastal states  including certain states in which selective s insurance subsidiaries transact homeowners insurance business  are considering legislation requiring that insurers that write homeowners insurance in any geographic area of a state must write homeowners insurance in all geographic areas of that state 
selective cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulation will be enacted  and the ultimate impact on selective will depend upon the specifics of the legislation or regulation and the state or states that adopt any such legislation or regulation 
credit scoring regulation selective uses certain aspects of credit scores when evaluating individual risks 
in june the united states supreme court interpreted the fair credit reporting act fcra concerning the meaning of the term adverse action as it relates to an insurance carrier s use of credit scoring when it quotes premium for a personal lines applicant or raises premium for an existing personal lines insured 
this interpretation requires insurance carriers to notify policyholders and applicants when their credit reports are the basis for adverse action  such as a rate increase 
an adverse action notification  according to the interpretation  would be required if a quoted rate is higher than it would have been in a credit neutral comparison  which compares the credit score based rate against a credit score neutral rate 
the interpretation does not require an insurance carrier to inform all policyholders that their credit reports have been reviewed in the underwriting process or that the rate they have received is higher than the best possible rate of the carrier 
in  states introduced bills seeking to limit or completely restrict the use of credit scores on individuals 
in addition  the federal trade commission produced a report in late stating the use of credit scores is an accurate predictor of risk and is not prejudicial to minority groups 
congress is expected to continue investigating this issue and many state legislatures and agencies will continue to monitor the impact credit scoring has on the insurance marketplace 
changes to regulation regarding the use of credit scores may impact the way in which the company prices business and or notifies policyholders or applicants of adverse actions resulting from the use of these score 
flood insurance regulation the federal government s nfip program currently covers flooding caused by storm surge where water is pushed toward the shore by the force of the winds swirling around a storm 
if this federal program is modified in an unfavorable manner  whereby flooding related to storm surge is no longer covered or is required to be covered by homeowners policies  such modification could have a material adverse effect on selective s flood and or homeowners results 
legislation exists that may force policies to cover claims related to windstorm damage and could lower the fee paid by the nfip to the servicing carrier 
the current repayment of claims by the nfip could also be restricted  with the current authorization expected to last only to regulation and legislation of agent compensation selective s insurance subsidiaries sell insurance products and services primarily through appointed independent insurance agents 
accordingly  selective seeks to compensate its agents consistent with market practices and pay commissions and other consideration for business agents place with selective s insurance subsidiaries 
selective discloses its compensation practices in notices to all policyholders and on selective s public website  while referring all specific questions about agent compensation to the agent that placed the business with selective 

table of contents because selective s agents also generally represent several of selective s competitors  selective s primary marketing strategy is to develop close relationships with each agent by i soliciting their feedback on products and services  ii advising them concerning company developments  and iii investing significant time with them professionally and socially  and  develop with each agent  and then carefully monitor  annual goals regarding i types and mix of risks placed with selective  ii amounts of premium or numbers of policies placed with selective  iii customer service levels  and iv profitability of business placed with selective 
at present  selective believes its agent compensation practices and disclosures meet current legal and regulatory requirements 
over the last two years  however  certain state attorneys general have investigated  and continue to investigate  various alleged anticompetitive practices engaged in by several insurance brokers and national insurance companies that compete with selective 
some of these investigations  mainly related to insureds that are much larger than selective s target customers  have resulted in consent orders under which brokers and several of selective s competitors have left uncontested the attorneys general s allegations that some of their compensation arrangements may have caused certain brokers to clandestinely steer clients to specific insurers without sufficient disclosure to the client 
the consent orders also have  to one degree or another  banned the use of such compensation arrangements by the offending brokers and insurers in several  but not all  lines of business 
given the regulatory scrutiny of compensation arrangements with brokers to date  it is possible that compensation arrangements between insurers and independent agents will come under further review and will be the subject of public policy debate and possible legislative reform 
selective monitors these developments but cannot determine the nature or effect  if any  that such a public policy debate or possible legislative reform will have on its agent compensation practices or business 
reinsurance regulation florida  a state in which selective does not write homeowners insurance  recently passed legislation i changing the funding and operation of the florida state sponsored insurer of last resort  citizens property insurance corporation  and the florida hurricane catastrophe fund fhcf  which is the florida state sponsored reinsurance facility  and ii prohibiting residential property insurers from including in rate calculations the additional costs of private reinsurance or loss exposure that duplicates fhcf coverage 
in the short term  such legislative action may increase overall private property reinsurance availability and reduce its costs outside of florida 
should other states in which selective writes business enact similar legislation  it is possible that selective may not be able to include the costs of reinsurance that it deems appropriate in its rates 
in such an event  selective may be forced  if permitted under applicable law  to exit certain markets 
if not permitted to exit such markets  selective may face unfair competitive situations  where state sponsored insurers implement rate freezes or decreases 
selective s ability to reduce its exposure to risks depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance 
selective transfers its risk exposure to other insurance and reinsurance companies through reinsurance arrangements 
through these arrangements  another insurer assumes a specified portion of the company s losses and loss adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of the insurance policy premiums 
the availability  amount  and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions  which may vary significantly 
any decrease in the amount of selective s reinsurance will increase its risk of loss 
selective also faces credit risk with respect to reinsurance 
in addition  reinsurers which the company has contracted with may default in their financial obligations as a result of insolvency  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
the inability of any of the company s reinsurers to meet their financial obligations could materially and adversely affect selective s operations  as the company remains primarily liable to its customers under the policies that it has reinsured 
class action litigation could affect selective s business practices and financial results 
selective s industries have been the target of class action litigation in areas including the following after market crash parts  urban homeowner underwriting practices  credit scoring and predictive modeling pricing  investment disclosure  health maintenance organization practices  discounting and payment of personal injury protection claims  and shareholder class action suits 

table of contents a change in selective s market share in new jersey could adversely impact the results of its private passenger automobile business 
new jersey insurance regulations require new jersey auto insurers to involuntarily write private passenger automobile insurance for individuals who are unable to obtain insurance in the voluntary market 
these policies are priced according to a separate rating scheme that is established by the assigned risk plan and subject to approval by njdobi 
the amount of involuntary insurance an insurer must write in new jersey depends on the insurer s statewide market share the greater the market share  the more involuntary coverage the insurer is required to write 
the underwriting of involuntary personal automobile insurance in new jersey has been historically unprofitable 
in addition to the assigned risk plan in new jersey  there are ongoing attempts to address rate disparities between different geographic regions in the state  as well as judicial attempts to address limitations of lawsuits 
selective depends on key personnel 
to a large extent  the success of selective s businesses is dependent on its ability to attract and retain key employees  in particular its senior officers  key management  sales  information systems  underwriting  claims  hr outsourcing  and corporate personnel 
competition to attract and retain key personnel is intense 
while selective has employment agreements with a number of key managers  the company generally does not have employment contracts with its employees and cannot ensure that it will be able to attract and retain key personnel 
in addition  selective s workforce is older  with an average age of approximately of selective s workforce is retirement eligible under selective s retirement and benefit plans 
selective faces risks from technology related failures 
selective s businesses are increasingly dependent on computer and internet enabled technology 
the company s inability to anticipate or manage problems with technology associated with scalability  security  functionality  or reliability could adversely affect its ability to write business and service accounts  and could adversely impact its results of operations and financial condition 
selective faces risks as a servicing carrier in the write your own wyo program of the united states government s national flood insurance program nfip 
flood insurance is offered through the nfip  which is managed by the mitigation division of fema under the us department of homeland security 
in  the destruction caused by the active hurricane season stressed the nfip with flood losses currently estimated by fema to be in excess of billion 
selective continues to monitor developments with the nfip regarding its ability to pay claims in the event of another large scale disaster 
congress controls the federal agency s funding authority and future limitations in this funding could occur 
effective october   the fee paid to selective by the nfip decreased points to of premiums written 
this fee structure is still in place as of december  however  during  the nfip is expected to further decrease the fee points to 
further reductions in this rate could occur through legislative activity 
the current program is also being reevaluated to include a cap on claim fees paid by the nfip 
while the final outcome of this legislation is unknown  this cap could impact the ultimate claim fee the company could receive in the event that there is a large catastrophe in an area in which selective is geographically concentrated 
selective faces risks in the hr outsourcing business 
selective hr s operations are affected by numerous federal and state laws and regulations relating to employment matters  benefits plans  and taxes 
in performing services for its clients  selective hr assumes some obligations of an employer under these laws and regulations 
regulation in the hr outsourcing business is constantly evolving  which could result in the modification of laws and regulations from time to time 
selective cannot predict what additional government initiatives  if any  affecting selective hr s business may be promulgated in the future 
consequently  the company also cannot predict whether selective hr will be able to adapt to new or modified regulatory requirements or obtain necessary licenses and government approvals 
selective is subject to the compliance requirements of the federal securities laws 
selective is subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws as a registrant under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
in the event selective was unable to comply with the federal securities laws  the company would likely be unable to access the public capital markets  which would make it more difficult to raise necessary capital and or increase the cost of capital 
if selective cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  the business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

table of contents selective employs anti takeover measures that may discourage potential acquirers and could adversely affect the value of its common stock 
selective owns all of the shares of stock of its insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the states of new jersey  new york  north carolina  south carolina  and maine 
state insurance laws require prior approval by state insurance departments of any acquisition or control of a domestic insurance company or of any company that controls a domestic insurance company 
any purchase of or more of selective s outstanding common stock would require prior action by all or some of the insurance commissioners of these states 
other factors also may discourage  delay  or prevent a change of control of selective  including  among others  provisions in the company s certificate of incorporation as amended  relating to supermajority voting and fair price to selective s business combinations  staggered terms for selective s directors  supermajority voting requirements to amend the foregoing provisions  selective s stockholders rights plan  and the ability of selective s board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock 
the new jersey shareholders protection act provides that selective  as a new jersey corporation  may not engage in business combinations specified in the statute with a shareholder having indirect or direct beneficial ownership of or more of the voting power of selective s outstanding stock an interested shareholder for a period of five years following the date on which the shareholder became an interested shareholder  unless the business combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation before the date the shareholder became an interested shareholder 
in addition  selective may not engage at any time in any business combination with any interested shareholder other than i a business combination approved by selective s board of directors prior to the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder  ii a business combination approved by two thirds of selective s shareholders other than the interested shareholder  or iii a business combination that satisfies certain price criteria 
these provisions also could have the effect of depriving selective stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price if a hostile takeover were attempted and may adversely affect the value of selective s common stock

item legal proceedings 
in the ordinary course of conducting business  selective and its subsidiaries are named as defendants in various legal proceedings 
most of these proceedings are claims litigation involving the insurance subsidiaries as either a liability insurers defending or providing indemnity for third party claims brought against insureds or b insurers defending first party coverage claims brought against them 
selective accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
selective s management expects that the ultimate liability  if any  with respect to such ordinary course claims litigation  after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense  will not be material to selective s consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
from time to time  the insurance subsidiaries are also involved in other legal actions  some of which assert claims for substantial amounts 
these actions include  among others  putative state class actions seeking certification of a state or national class 
such putative class actions have alleged  for example  improper reimbursement of medical providers paid under workers compensation and personal and commercial automobile insurance policies 
the insurance subsidiaries are also from time to time involved in individual actions in which extra contractual damages  punitive damages  or penalties are sought  such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims 
selective believes that it has valid defenses to these cases 
selective s management expects that the ultimate liability  if any  with respect to such lawsuits  after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses  will not be material to selective s consolidated financial condition 
nonetheless  given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions  and the inherent unpredictability of litigation  an adverse outcome in certain matters could  from time to time  have a material adverse effect on selective s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods

selective s ability to receive dividends  loans  or advances from its insurance subsidiaries is subject to the approval and or review of the insurance regulators in the respective domiciliary states of the insurance subsidiaries
