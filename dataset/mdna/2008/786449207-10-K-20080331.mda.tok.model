principles of accounting for ownership interests in partner companies we account for our interests in our partner companies and private equity funds using three methods consolidation  equity or cost 
the accounting method applied is generally determined by the degree of our influence over the entity  primarily determined by on our voting interest in the entity 
consolidation method 
we account for our partner companies in which we directly or indirectly own more than of the outstanding voting securities using the consolidation method of accounting 
we reflect the participation of other partner company stockholders in the income or losses of our consolidated partner companies as minority interest in the consolidated statements of operations 
minority interest adjusts our consolidated operating results to reflect only our share of the earnings or losses of the consolidated partner companies 
if there is no minority interest 
table of contents balance remaining on the consolidated balance sheets related to the respective partner company  we record of the consolidated partner company s losses  we record of subsequent earnings of the partner company to the extent of such previously recognized losses in excess of our proportionate share 
equity method 
we account for partner companies whose results are not consolidated  but over whom we exercise significant influence  using the equity method of accounting 
we also account for our interests in some private equity funds under the equity method of accounting  depending on our respective general and limited partner interests 
under the equity method of accounting  our share of the income or loss of the company is reflected in equity loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
we report our share of the income or loss of the equity method partner companies on a one quarter lag 
when the carrying value of our holding in an equity method partner company is reduced to zero  no further losses are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations unless we have outstanding guarantee obligations or have committed additional funding to the equity method partner company 
when the equity method partner company subsequently reports income  we will not record our share of such income until it equals the amount of our share of losses not previously recognized 
cost method 
we account for partner companies which are not consolidated or accounted for under the equity method using the cost method of accounting 
under the cost method  our share of the income or losses of such partner companies is not included in our consolidated statements of operations 
however  the effect of the change in market value of cost method partner company holdings classified as trading securities is reflected in other income loss  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
these judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly important because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include the following revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill impairment  impairment of ownership interests in and advances to companies  income taxes  commitments and contingencies  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition during  and  our revenue from continuing operations was primarily attributable to acsis since december  alliance consulting  clarient and laureate pharma 

table of contents acsis generates revenue from i software fees  which consist of revenue from the licensing of software  ii services revenue  which consist of fees from consulting  implementation and training services  plus customer support services  and iii hardware and reimbursed project expenses 
acsis recognizes software fees in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
acsis recognizes software license revenue when the following criteria are met a signed contract is obtained  delivery of the products has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
acsis generally recognizes license revenue using the residual method when there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement that is not accounted for using long term contract accounting 
for those contracts that contain significant customization or modifications  license revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
acsis recognizes revenue from professional consulting services under fixed price arrangements  using the proportional performance method based on direct labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated labor costs required to complete the project 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
acsis recognizes hardware revenue upon shipment by the vendor to the customer unless the hardware is an element of an arrangement that includes services involving significant customization or modifications to software  in which case  hardware revenue is bundled with the software and services  and recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
alliance consulting generates revenue primarily from consulting services 
alliance consulting generally recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services are performed  the service fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue from services is recognized as services are performed 
alliance consulting also performs certain services under fixed price service contracts related to discrete projects 
alliance consulting recognizes revenue from these contracts using the percentage of completion method  primarily based on the actual labor hours incurred to date compared to the estimated total hours of the project 
any losses expected to be incurred on jobs in process are charged to income in the period such losses become known 
changes in estimates of total costs could result in changes in the amount of revenue recognized 
clarient generates revenue from diagnostic services and recognizes such revenue at the time of completion of services at amounts equal to the contractual rates allowed from third parties including medicare  insurance companies and  to a small degree  private pay patients 
these expected amounts are based both on medicare allowable rates and clarient s collection experience with other third party payors 
laureate pharma s revenue is primarily derived from contract manufacturing work  process development services  and formulation and filling 
laureate pharma may enter into revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in order to meet its customers needs 
multiple element revenue agreements are evaluated under emerging issues task force eitf issue number  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria in eitf are treated as one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
revenue is generally recognized upon the performance of services 
certain services are performed under fixed price contracts 
revenue from these contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
when current cost estimates indicate a loss is expected to be incurred  the entire loss is recorded in the period in which it is identified 
changes in estimates of total costs could result in changes in the amount of revenue recognized 
impairment of long lived assets we test long lived assets  including property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
we evaluate the recoverability of an asset by comparing its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
if the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount  we measure any impairment loss as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the carrying value of net intangible assets at december  was million 
the carrying value of net property and equipment at december  was million 

table of contents impairment of goodwill we conduct an annual review for impairment of goodwill as of december st and as otherwise required by circumstances or events 
additionally  on an interim basis  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
factors that we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends or a decline in a company s stock price for a sustained period 
we test for impairment at a reporting unit level same as or one level below an operating segment as defined in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we assess whether goodwill of the reporting unit is impaired 
to determine fair value  we use a number of valuation methods including quoted market prices  discounted cash flows and revenue and acquisition multiples 
depending on the complexity of the valuation and the significance of the carrying value of the goodwill to the consolidated financial statements  we may engage an outside valuation firm to assist us in determining fair value 
as an overall check on the reasonableness of the fair values attributed to our reporting units  we will consider comparing the aggregate fair values for all reporting units with our average total market capitalization for a reasonable period of time 
in  the company conducted a goodwill impairment review related to its alliance consulting segment  due to underperformance relative to historical and expected operating results 
the company engaged an outside valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of alliance consulting using valuation methods which included discounted cash flows and revenue and acquisition multiples for comparable public companies 
the company determined that the carrying value of alliance consulting exceeded its fair value  indicating a potential impairment of goodwill 
the company then estimated the implied fair value of the alliance consulting goodwill 
the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill was million  which amount was recognized as an impairment loss within goodwill impairment in the consolidated statements of operations 
the carrying value of goodwill at december  was million 
our partner companies operate in industries which are rapidly evolving and extremely competitive 
it is reasonably possible that our accounting estimates with respect to the ultimate recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill could change in the near term and that the effect of such changes on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
while we believe that the current recorded carrying value of our goodwill is not impaired  there can be no assurance that a significant write down or write off will not be required in the future 
impairment of ownership interests in and advances to companies on a periodic basis but no less frequently than at the end of each quarter we evaluate the carrying value of our equity and cost method partner companies for possible impairment based on achievement of business plan objectives and milestones  the financial condition and prospects of the company and other relevant factors 
the business plan objectives and milestones we consider include  among others  those related to financial performance  such as achievement of planned financial results or completion of capital raising activities  and those that are not primarily financial in nature  such as hiring of key employees or the establishment of strategic relationships 
we then determine whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of our ownership interest in the company 
impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value 
the fair value of privately held partner companies is generally determined based on the value at which independent third parties have invested or have committed to invest in these companies or based on other valuation methods including discounted cash flows  valuation of comparable public companies and the valuation of acquisitions of similar companies 
the fair value of our ownership interests in private equity funds is generally 
table of contents determined based on the value of our pro rata portion of the funds net assets and estimated future proceeds from sales of investments provided by the funds managers 
the new carrying value of a partner company is not increased if circumstances suggest the value of the partner company has subsequently recovered 
our partner companies operate in industries which are rapidly evolving and extremely competitive 
it is reasonably possible that our accounting estimates with respect to the ultimate recoverability of the carrying value of ownership interests in and advances to companies could change in the near term and that the effect of such changes on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
while we believe that the current recorded carrying values of our equity and cost method companies are not impaired  there can be no assurance that our future results will confirm this assessment or that a significant write down or write off will not be required in the future 
total impairment charges related to ownership interests in and advances to our equity and cost method partner companies are included in the following table year ended december  accounting method in millions equity cost total impairment charges related to equity method partner companies are included in equity loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
impairment charges related to cost method partner companies are included in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that we believe recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future years 
if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
commitments and contingencies from time to time  we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions which arise in the normal course of business 
additionally  we have received distributions as both a general partner and a limited partner from certain private equity funds 
in certain circumstances  we may be required to return a portion or all the distributions we received as a general partner of a fund for a further distribution to such fund s limited partners the clawback 
we are also a guarantor of various third party obligations and commitments and are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of provision required for these commitments and contingencies  if any  which would be charged to earnings  is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the provision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
changes in the provision could increase or decrease our earnings in the period the changes are made 

table of contents stock based compensation as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  prior to january   we accounted for employee stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  we recorded no compensation expense for stock options issued to employees at fair market value 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
accordingly  we have not restated prior period amounts 
under this application  we are required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the expected term of the award and the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term 
changes in these assumptions and in the estimated forfeitures of stock option awards can materially affect the amount of stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  the requisite service periods for market based stock option awards are based on our estimate of the dates on which the market conditions will be met as determined using a monte carlo simulation model 
changes in the derived requisite service period or achievement of market capitalization targets earlier than estimated can materially affect the amount of stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
results of operations we present our four consolidated partner companies as separate segments acsis  alliance consulting  clarient and laureate pharma

these commitments will be funded over the next several years  including approximately million which is expected to be funded in the next months 
we do not intend to commit to new investments in additional private equity funds and may seek to further reduce our current ownership interests in  and our existing commitments to  the funds in which we hold interests 

table of contents the transactions we enter into in pursuit of our strategy could increase or decrease our liquidity at any point in time 
as we seek to acquire interests in technology and life sciences companies or provide additional funding to existing partner companies  we may be required to expend our cash or incur debt  which will decrease our liquidity 
conversely  as we dispose of our interests in partner companies from time to time  we may receive proceeds from such sales which could increase our liquidity 
from time to time  we are engaged in discussions concerning acquisitions and dispositions which  if consummated  could impact our liquidity  perhaps significantly 
in may  we entered into a loan agreement with warren v 
musser  our former chairman and chief executive officer 
in december  we restructured the obligation to reduce the amount outstanding to million  bearing interest rate of per annum  so that we could obtain new collateral  which is expected to be the primary source of repayment  along with additional collateral required to be provided to us over time

since and through december  we received a total of million in cash payments on the loan  of which thousand was received during the carrying value of the loan at december  was zero 
we have received distributions as both a general partner and a limited partner from certain private equity funds 
under certain circumstances  we may be required to return a portion or all the distributions we received as a general partner of a fund for further distribution to such fund s limited partners the clawback 
assuming for these purposes only that the funds were liquidated or dissolved on december  and the only distributions from the funds were equal to the carrying value of the funds on the december  financial statements  the maximum clawback we would be required to return for our general partner interest is million 
as of december   management estimated this liability to be approximately million  of which million was reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and million was reflected in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
our previous ownership in the general partners of the funds which have potential clawback liabilities range from 
the clawback liability is joint and several  such that we may be required to fund the clawback for other general partners should they default 
the funds have taken several steps to reduce the potential liabilities should other general partners default  including withholding all general partner distributions and placing them in escrow and adding rights of set off among certain funds 
we believe our liability for the default of other general partners is remote 
for the reasons we presented above  we believe our cash and cash equivalents at december   availability under our revolving credit facilities and other internal sources of cash flow will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the next months  including commitments to our existing companies and funds  possible additional funding of existing partner companies and our general corporate requirements 
our acquisition of new partner company interests is always contingent upon our availability of cash to fund such deployments  and our timing of monetization events directly affects our availability of cash 
consolidated partner companies each of our consolidated partner companies incurred losses in and may need additional capital to fund their operations 
from time to time  some or all of our consolidated partner companies may require additional debt or equity financing or credit support from us to fund planned expansion activities 
if we decide not to  or can t  provide sufficient capital resources to allow them to reach a positive cash flow position  and they are unable to raise capital from outside resources  they may need to scale back their operations 
if alliance consulting meets its business plans for  we believe they will have sufficient cash or availability under established lines of credit to fund their operations for at least the next twelve months 
we expect that acsis and laureate pharma will require additional capital in to fund their business plans 
as described below  we have renewed  expanded and extended a revolving line of credit to clarient 
alliance consulting  acsis and laureate pharma are among the six partner companies expected to be sold during the second quarter of as part of the bundle transaction

the mezzanine facility is subject to reduction back to million under certain circumstances involving the completion of replacement financing by clarient 
as reported in its form k for the year ended december   clarient s independent auditors have determined that there is substantial doubt about clarient s ability to continue as a going concern 
clarient s bank credit facility matures in february  at which time  clarient will need to extend  renew or refinance such debt and possibly secure additional debt or equity financing in order to fund anticipated working capital needs and capital expenditures and to execute its strategy 
there can be no assurance clarient will be able to maintain compliance with financial covenants in its credit facility which could result in the lender requiring repayment of the debt earlier than the scheduled maturity 
clarient has not had a history of complying with such covenants 
this facility is guaranteed by the company 
should clarient s sources of funding be inadequate  clarient management s plans would include seeking waivers from existing lenders  pursuing additional sources of funding or curtailment of expenses
