item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement on forward looking information hyperdynamics is including the following cautionary statement to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of for any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  hyperdynamics 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include statements concerning plans  objectives  goals  strategies  expectations  future events or performance and underlying assumptions and other statements which are other than statements of historical facts 
certain statements contained herein are forward looking statements and  accordingly  involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
our expectations  beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and are believed by us to have a reasonable basis  including without limitations  management s examination of historical operating trends  data contained in our records and other data available from third parties  but there can be no assurance that management s expectations  beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished 
in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein  the following are important factors that  in the view of hyperdynamics  could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements our ability to respond to changes in the oil exploration and production environment  competition  the availability of financing  and  if available  on terms and conditions acceptable to us  and the availability of personnel in the future to support our activities 
overview our corporate mission is to provide energy for the future by exploring for  developing new  and re establishing pre existing sources of energy worldwide 
through our domestic and international business segments  we produce oil in louisiana  usa and we explore for oil in guinea  west africa 
domestic operations our operations in louisiana produce oil and provide revenues and cash flows 
the business model is that the domestic production will provide sufficient cash flow to support our corporate overhead  so that capital raised can be devoted to work on our concession in guinea 
we have not yet experienced sufficient cash flow to accomplish the goal of covering overhead with net cash flows from oil production 
however  we did double oil production and triple our revenue in the past fiscal year ended june  the increase in production is attributable to our rabb acquisition of working interest in over  gross acres on july  we acquired the working interest with the knowledge that the wells we acquired would require significant workover and repair to re establish and optimize production 
we made the investment required and have seen the results 
in the quarter ended june   we averaged gross production of  barrels per month 
our production cost per barrel decreased over the quarter ended june  due to the completion of the workover work 
we expect the quarter ended september  to have lower production than the quarter ended june  due to the hurricane season 
however  once production that was disrupted by the storms returns to normal  we believe that we have established a reserve base that is large enough that economies of scale will reduce our cost per barrel and that the strong price of oil will support our revenues 
in order to maintain or increase our reserve base  we are continually evaluating new leases and opportunities for drilling 

table of contents international operations on september   our wholly owned subsidiary  scs corporation signed a production sharing contract the psc with the republic of guinea 
the psc gives us exclusive rights to explore  develop  and produce the petroleum resources in an area of approximately  square miles off the coast of guinea 
developments of our work on the psc over the past year include the following we have developed operational plans for our exploration efforts 
our staff has reinterpreted and clarified our past and  d seismic data and have identified approximately twenty five potential drilling targets 
we have decided to focus on the transform margin play offshore the republic of guinea 
over the last three years  this play has resulted in at least new field discoveries offshore west africa that we know of to date which total to an approximate number of eight billion barrels of proved oil equivalent reserves 
we moved forward with the exploration work to fulfill the first exploration period obligations of our psc 
we engaged a contractor to perform seismic work offshore guinea d seismic 
the survey area of  kilometers included specific quadrants of the original acquisition grid so that we could focus on areas that we had a particular interest in 
we focused efforts along the shelf slope complex of the transform margin running through the offshore guinea contract area so that we could better verify various potential drilling targets 
during the fourth quarter ended june  and the quarter ended september   we received the d seismic  reprocessed it  and interpreted it 
we also negotiated a contract with a contractor to acquire up to  square kilometers of d seismic data 
we believe that the d seismic data will provide us with a portfolio of drillable prospects 
sources of financing during the year ended june  the financing obtained during the year included in december  a warrant holder exercised warrants that provided  in new capital to the company 
on december   we filed an s registration statement to establish a shelf registration of securities to allow the company to obtain up to fifty million dollars  in new capital 
the s was declared effective in february on february   we borrowed  in a financing transaction from ya global investments  lp ya global 
on march   as part of the same financing transaction  we borrowed an additional  from ya global bringing the total borrowed to  the loans were non convertible unless we defaulted 
in connection with these loans  we executed mortgages on our louisiana oil and gas producing properties and filed a ucc financing statement on the assets of our subsidiary  trendsetter production company 
on may   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with two investors who purchased  shares of common stock 
they received  warrants with an exercise price of and the total net proceeds for the company was  after paying commission and expenses 
these funds were used to pay for the d seismic data acquisition and processing and for general business purposes 
this transaction triggered the repricing of warrants held by others  resulting in an additional expense of  analysis of changes in financial position our current assets decreased  or  from  on june  to  on june  the most significant factor in the decrease is the stock subscription receivable of  which was collected in july the proceeds from that and other capital raises funded our operations and the capital investments we made during the year 
our long term assets increased  or  from  on june  to  on june  we made significant investments in oil and gas properties in both the usa and in guinea see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we invested  in the guinea concession 
our major accomplishment with regard to the guinea concession was the completion of the acquisition of approximately  kilometers of d seismic data 
we invested  in our oil and gas properties in the usa 
we acquired existing reserves and we also conducted some drilling and development activity 
as a result of our investment in the domestic oil and gas properties  we increased our reserve base 
proved developed producing reserves attributable to our net revenue interest as of june  and  respectively  were  and  this represents an increase of  barrels 

table of contents our current liabilities increased  or  from  on june  to  on june  the main factor in the increase is accounts payable  particularly accounts payable relating to the investments we had made in oil and gas properties  which totaled  and joint interest billing amounts due for lease operating expense of  these outstanding balances were paid during the quarter ended september  we also accrued a legal settlement of  which we believe may begin a payout of  per month as early as january our long term liabilities increased  from  as of june  to  as of june   due to increases in asset retirement obligations see note of the consolidated financial statements and new debt see note of the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations 
based on the factors discussed below for each segment and for the corporate overhead  the net loss attributable to common shareholders decreased  or  from  or per share in to  or per share in the decrease in the net loss is due to a decrease in the net loss from operations for hyd of  and a decrease in the net loss from operations for corporate of  partially offset by an increase in the net loss from operations of scs of  the net loss chargeable to common shareholders includes a provision for preferred stock dividends of  in and  in reportable segments hyperdynamics has two reportable segments our international operations in guinea scs and our domestic louisiana operations hydr 
scs is engaged in oil and gas exploration activities pertaining to offshore guinea  west africa 
hydr is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production activities in louisiana  usa 
hyperdynamics evaluates performance based on profit or loss from operations 
the reportable segments are managed by separate management teams who are evaluated based on their segment s performance 
results of operations domestic hydr comparison for fiscal year and the following table summarizes certain production  cost  and revenue information twelve months ended june  numeric increase increase gross barrels sold net barrels sold revenues from oil and gas production lease operating costs average sales price per barrel 
table of contents revenues 
our revenue from oil and gas production increased due to higher oil production and higher sales prices for oil 
we have no revenues from gas production 
the production increase is almost entirely attributable to production from the oil wells acquired in the rabb acquisition in july lease operating costs include severance tax  which varies with revenue  of  during the year ended june  in comparison to  in this represents an increase of or  which is attributable to the increased revenues during the year ended june  the increase in other lease operating costs of  or  is primarily attributable to the expenses of operating the rabb properties acquired in july these expenses include significant repairs that we performed in an effort to increase future production 
during  we worked over or reworked twelve oil wells and four service wells for a cost of  our increase in routine lease operating expenses related to the operation of oil wells acquired in july averaged about  per month or about accretion expense 
in accordance with sfas  we discount the fair value of our asset retirement obligations and record accretion expense due to the passage of time using the interest method of allocation 
accordingly  the accretion expense is a function of the balance of the asset retirement obligation 
as of july  and  respectively  our asset retirement obligation was  and  respectively 
additional liabilities incurred during the current year were  and revisions in estimate of the asset retirement obligations increased the liability by an additional  total accretion expenses for the year ended june  was  compared to  in the increase is due to the higher asset retirement obligation balance 
as of june   the asset retirement obligation is  our depreciation  depletion and amortization was  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase of or  is due to higher depletion expenses attributable to additions to the full cost pool  partially offset by a decrease in the depletion rate per barrel of oil equivalent produced 
the full cost pool increased  with the rabb properties acquisition  improvements to the production facilities at our magee smith lease  development costs  drilling costs for three oil wells  and additional geological and geophysical expenses 
the depletion rate decreased because of the reserves added with the purchase of the rabb properties and the completion of a new successful well 
settlement expense for the year ended june  was and  in we were sued by an investor in working interest in some of our oil and gas properties in the year ended june  pursuant to the settlement agreement  we issued  warrants to purchase our common stock at an adjusted exercise price of per share 
the expenses are calculated using the fair value of the warrants as of the date they were granted as estimated by the black scholes option pricing model and based upon exercise price 
the expense occurred only once 
selling  general  and administrative related party was  for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  mike watts  the brother of kent watts  provides investor relations  public relations  financial consulting  and general advisory services in conjunction with a contract entered into during march for services he will deliver through march the  represents reimbursements for his expenses as authorized by his contract 
our selling  general and administrative expense decreased  or  from  to  for the years ended june  and june   respectively 
selling  general  and administrative expense includes administrative expenses  other operational costs  and gains or losses on sales and disposals of assets 
significant drivers in the change in selling  general  and administrative expenses were other operational costs for the year ended june  was  in comparison to  in this represents a decrease of  or  due to decreases in expenses related to repairs and maintenance  tools and yard costs  field labor and decrease in number of field employees 
during the quarter ended june   we restructured the field office and discharged all but one administrative employee 
thus  future operational costs should be minimal 
loss on sales of assets decreased by  we recognized a gain on sales of assets of  as opposed to a loss on disposal of assets of  in 
table of contents administrative expenses decreased by  the main driver in this decrease was legal and professional expenses  which decreased by  the reduction in legal costs is comprised of two factors they are reduced by a  reimbursement that we received in august from our insurance company for legal expenses associated with a suit that was settled during the year ended june  and a general reduction in legal expenses because we were not defending a lawsuit during the year ended june  in addition  we experienced a net decrease in administrative expenses of  our loss from operations from this segment was  and  for the years ended june and  respectively 
comparison for fiscal year and the following table summarizes certain production  cost  and revenue information twelve months ended june  increase decrease change gross barrels sold net barrels sold revenues from oil and gas production lease operating costs average sales price per barrel revenues 
our revenue from oil and gas production increased due to equipment upgrades and less downtime  which resulted in higher production of oil 
we had no gas production 
lease operating costs include severance tax  which varies with revenue  of  during the year ended june  in comparison to  in this represents an increase of or  the decrease in other lease operating costs of  or  was due to upgrades and maintenance of equipment resulting in higher performance 
our depreciation  depletion and amortization was  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this represents an increase of or  this is attributable to more depletion because of additions to the full cost pool during settlement expense for the year ended june  was  and in we were sued by an investor in working interest in some of our oil and gas properties 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  we issued  warrants to purchase our common stock at an adjusted exercise price of per share 
the expenses are calculated using the fair value of the warrants as of the date they were granted as estimated by the black scholes option pricing model and based upon exercise price 
our selling  general and administrative expense decreased  or  from  to  for the years ended june  and june   respectively 
selling  general  and administrative expense includes administrative expenses  other operational costs  and gains or losses on sales and disposals of assets 
the most significant drivers in the change in selling  general  and administrative expenses were other operational costs and a loss on sales of assets as follows other operational costs for the year ended june  was  in comparison to  in this represents a decrease of or  due to decreases in expenses related to repairs and maintenance  tools and yard costs  field labor and decrease in number of field employees 

table of contents loss on sales of assets decreased by  the decrease is due to two main factors 
we issued common stock in hyperdynamics to repurchase working interest in some oil and gas properties that had previously been sold in we recorded the amount received at the time the investor originally purchased the working interest as an adjustment to the full cost pool  effectively rescinding the sale 
the excess in the value of the stock over the original investment was recorded as a loss of  this was a one time charge 
additionally  we had a loss on disposal of assets of  in  whereas in we recognized a gain on sales of assets of our loss from operations from this segment was  and  for the years ended june and  respectively 
results of operations international scs comparison for fiscal year and revenues 
there were no revenues for the years ended june  and we have focused on the acquisition and interpretation of seismic data for our concession in guinea

critical accounting policies we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting as prescribed by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
accordingly  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of proved oil and natural gas properties  including the costs of abandoned properties  dry holes  geophysical costs  and annual lease rentals are capitalized 
all general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred 
sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change 
depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on proved reserves 
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  net of tax considerations 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin topic dc  we utilize the prices in effect on a date subsequent to the end of a reporting period in which the full cost ceiling limitation was exceeded at the end of a reporting period 
the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 

table of contents costs excluded costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves 
we review our unevaluated properties at the end of each quarter to determine whether the costs incurred should be transferred to the full cost pool and thereby subject to amortization 
we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
the assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
we assess our unevaluated properties on a country by country basis 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment  the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 
however  if proved reserves have not yet been established in a full cost pool  these costs are charged against earnings in the respective country 
for these international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
ceiling test the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule under full cost accounting rules for each cost center  capitalized costs of proved properties  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  shall not exceed an amount the cost ceiling equal to the sum of a the present value of future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves  based on current economic and operating conditions  discounted at percent  plus b the cost of properties not being amortized  plus c the lower of cost or estimated fair value of any unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  less d any income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the properties involved 
if capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is charged as an impairment expense 
as of june   we have capitalized  in oil and gas properties  which is subject to the ceiling test for impairment 
at june   there was no impairment indicated 
impairment at june    we had  of capitalized costs associated with our guinea operations 
based on an impairment analysis performed by an independent economist and the completion of work requirements under the production sharing contract between scs corporation and guinea  no impairment of these assets was indicated as of june  environmental obligations and other contingencies management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters  including  but not limited to  the stage of investigation  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
in future periods  a number of factors could significantly change our estimate of environmental remediation costs  such as changes in laws and regulations  or changes in their interpretation or administration  revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater  and changes in costs of labor  equipment and technology 
consequently  it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from our estimates 

table of contents proved reserves estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and sec guidelines 
our engineering estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of i the quality and quantity of available data  ii the interpretation of that data  iii the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and iv the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
changes in oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves 
we utilize independent reserve engineers to estimate our proved reserves 
asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligations represent our best estimate of the fair value of our future abandonment costs associated with our oil and gas properties  including the costs of removal and disposition of tangible equipment  site and environmental restoration 
we estimate the fair value of our retirement costs in the period in which the liability is incurred  if a reasonable estimate can be made 
the determination of the fair value of an asset retirement obligation generally involves estimating the fair value of the obligation at the end of the property s useful life and then discounting it to present value using our credit adjusted  risk free rate of return 
estimating future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding the expected removal and site restoration costs  timing and present value discount rates 
changes in the estimated useful life and the fair value of the asset retirement obligation are imprecise since the removal activities will generally occur several years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are political  environmental and safety considerations that may ultimately impact the amount of the obligations 
fair value of our debt and equity transactions many of our various debt and equity transactions require us to determine the fair value of a debt or equity instrument in order to properly record the transaction in our financial statements 
fair value is generally determined by applying widely acceptable valuation models  eg  the black scholes valuation model using the trading price of the underlying instrument or by comparison to instruments with comparable maturities and terms 
share based compensation effective july   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which was issued in december  using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations 
sfas no 
r requires recognition of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments in the financial statements over the period the employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award presumptively the vesting period 
sfas no 
r also requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we account for non employee share based awards in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquisition  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 

table of contents contingent obligations we have a contingent  note payable that is only payable with of the profits of scs corporation 
we have the right to pay this note off using common stock 
also  in conjunction with our purchase of hyd resources corporation in april  we have two contingent obligations to pay  these obligations are payable over the five years ending in april and they are payable only in the event that hyd resources is profitable 
the determination of net income will be made quarterly and the pay down of the obligations is of the net income per quarter 
disclosure of contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years installment obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total liquidity and capital resources liquidity our ratio of current assets to current liabilities current ratio was to one and to one at june  and  respectively 
however  current liabilities contain several items that are payable in stock or are the subject of deferred payment arrangements whereby the vendor will not get paid except out of future revenues or cash received from a joint venture partner 
dividends payable of  and dividends payable to related party of  are payable in stock 
approximately  of the accounts payable was paid with common stock after the balance sheet date 
accounts payable seismic data of  is payable only when we sell the data to third parties or if we get cash infusion for the guinea concession 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
additionally   is accrued in accounts payable to a vendor who  by the terms of his agreement  will not be paid until we obtain funding from a financial or joint venture partner for guinea 
finally   of the asset retirement obligation short term was transferred to the buyer of our kelly and norris leases during july this amounts to approximately  of the  reflected in current liabilities which either will not result in a cash outflow or will not be paid until we have adequate funds to pay them 
our negative working capital highlights our need for additional funding and cash flows from operations 
with the new acquisition of producing properties in june  and the steady progress made in growing our reserves and production revenues in fiscal  our domestic operations are providing growing cash flow from operations to help cover its monthly expenses 
without the expenses and investment pertaining to our oil and gas contract area pursuant to the psc  we would be generating positive cash flow from operations 
management has assessed that we have the liquidity necessary to continue to meet current obligations as they become due throughout the coming year 
we sold convertible debentures in september and raised  after fees and the payoff of a note payable to another investor  ya global  approximately  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
we have evaluated our operating cash flow and believe that the funds we raised will cover our deficit 
we have also identified areas of our operations where we can achieve cost savings  if necessary 

table of contents this cash flow does not include any additional development of our production or adjustment to our operating budget 
we have three development wells that we are considering drilling that we estimate would increase our production and revenues 
our board has authorized us to proceed with the drilling on one of the locations 
the drilling cost associated with the site is  of which we can pay  in stock 
the cost to complete to the point of production is estimated as an additional  if we drill and complete a productive well  it will provide additional revenues 
all the mortgages associated with our producing oil properties have been released with the payoff of the ya global notes 
we are evaluating structuring a reserve based development loan to maximize our producing leases in louisiana 
management believes that it will be able to obtain development capital and significantly raise production revenues to a level to be able to pay all operating expenses including overhead for guinea operations  and the geological and geophysical staff working to explore offshore guinea 
our top corporate priority at this time is to attract a joint venture or financial partner so that we can fund an accelerated exploration work program offshore guinea 
we now expect these major funds to come primarily from selling working interest to financial partners or joint venture partners that invest in our guinea offshore contract area 
we believe that together with the success of the interpretive work performed by our geoscientists on the seismic data and the work we have performed since  that we will be able to obtain a joint venture with one or more viable oil company operators 
we have mapped our prospects and prepared an in depth technical presentation and data room available for review by potential partners under confidentiality agreements 
such joint ventures and the related liquidity would position us to acquire our d seismic that we have planned to start in december we can conduct work with our existing staff and data  but we prefer to stay on our accelerated exploration work schedule rather than slowing down for any reason 
in summary  we believe that between our production  possible cost cutting measures  and the funding we have in place  we can meet our overhead 
we are seeking reserve based financing so that we can increase our production and maintain and increase our reserve base 
we are seeking joint venture or financial partners to assist with the capital intensive exploration work offshore guinea 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various risks including energy commodity price risk  specifically  risk associated with changing prices of oil 
we expect oil prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
if oil prices were to decline significantly  revenues and cash flow would significantly decline  and our ability to borrow to finance our operations could be adversely impacted 
we do not hedge the oil commodity price risk at this time 
we believe this is appropriate to the size and scope of our operations 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
we have some foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from our in country office in guinea 
us dollars are accepted in guinea and many of our purchases and purchase obligations  such as our office lease in guinea  are denominated in us dollars 
however  our costs for labor  supplies  and fuel could increase if the guinea franc appreciates against the us dollar 
we do not hedge the exposure to currency rate changes
