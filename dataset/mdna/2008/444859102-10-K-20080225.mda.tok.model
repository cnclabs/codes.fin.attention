overview headquartered in louisville  kentucky  humana inc is one of the nation s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies  based on our revenues of billion 
we are a full service benefits solutions company  offering a wide array of health and supplemental benefit plans for employer groups  government benefit programs  and individuals 
as of december   we had approximately million members in our medical benefit plans  as well as approximately million members in our specialty products 
we manage our business with two segments government and commercial 
the government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs  and includes three lines of business medicare  military  and medicaid 
the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals 
we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of sfas  which aggregates products with similar economic characteristics 
these characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing  benefits  and underwriting requirements 
these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer 
the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes 
we allocate all selling  general and administrative expenses  investment and other revenue  interest expense  and goodwill  but no other assets or liabilities  to our segments 
members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks  enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers 
our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets 
as a result  the profitability of each segment is interdependent 
our results are impacted by many factors  but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium  aso fee  and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our benefit and administrative costs 
benefit costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces  including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures  new prescription drugs and therapies  an aging population  lifestyle challenges including obesity and smoking  the tort liability system  and government regulation 
our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance 
the benefits ratio  which is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues  represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability 
the selling  general  and administrative expense ratio  or sg a expense ratio  which is computed by taking total selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premium revenues  administrative services fees and other revenues  represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

table of contents government segment our strategy and commitment to the expanded medicare programs  including new product choices and pharmacy benefits for seniors  has led to significant growth 
medicare advantage membership increased to  members at december   up from  at december  and up from  at december   primarily due to sales of private fee for service  or pffs  products 
average medicare advantage membership was higher for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and average stand alone pdp membership was higher 
likewise  medicare premium revenues have increased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  we expect medicare advantage membership to continue to grow into  adding between  and  members by december   with a shift in sales mix towards our ppo and hmo offerings 
our quarterly government segment earnings are particularly impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership 
the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member s cumulative out of pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member s plan period which begins january for renewals 
these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total pharmacy costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages 
as a result the government segment s benefits ratio generally improves as the year progresses 
in addition  the number of low income senior members as well as year over year changes in the mix of membership in our stand alone pdp products  standard  enhanced  and complete  affect the quarterly benefits ratio pattern 
we expect the combination of these items will result in a greater proportion of earnings for to be earned in the first half versus the second half when compared to the quarterly earnings pattern in commercial segment we continue to increase the diversification of our commercial segment membership base and continue to exercise pricing discipline relative to our fully insured accounts 
commercial segment medical membership increased by  members from december  to  at december  primarily as a result of the acquisition of kmg america corporation  discussed more fully below  which added approximately  members  primarily aso 
the remaining increase primarily was due to enrollment gains in strategic areas of commercial growth including smart plans and other consumer offerings  individual  small group  and aso products  partially offset by a decline in the fully insured larger group product membership 
membership changes from exercising pricing discipline and sales focused on strategic growth areas resulted in a decline in the benefits ratio to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  in addition  we are diversifying our commercial segment revenues through expanded and new specialty product offerings with the acquisitions of compbenefits corporation and kmg america corporation in the fourth quarter of  each discussed further below 
these acquisitions significantly increased our dental membership and added new product offerings including vision and other supplemental health and life benefit plans primarily sold on a voluntary basis 
the supplemental health plans cover  for example  some of the costs associated with cancer and critical illness 
along with our acquisition of corphealth  inc  a behavioral health care management company  these specialty acquisitions are anticipated to enhance our commercial segment margins and our ability to appeal to more customers 
other highlights earnings increased to per diluted common share in from per diluted common share in  primarily due to increased premium revenue from higher average medicare membership 
year over year comparisons were impacted by changes in estimates associated with our medicare part d reconciliation with cms and the settlement of some tricare contractual provisions related to prior years which increased our government segment s results by million pretax  or per 
table of contents diluted common share  for the year ended december  in addition  a gain in the first quarter of of million pretax  or per diluted common share  from the sale of a venture capital investment also impacted year over year comparisons 
cash flows from operations decreased million to  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  our operating cash flows were unfavorably impacted by the part d provisions of our medicare contracts  primarily the payment of the million risk corridor payable to cms associated with the contract year  partially offset by improvement in operating earnings 
in september  we received approval from cms to resume marketing of individual medicare pffs plans 
this announcement ended the june  voluntary suspension agreed to in conjunction with other industry participants 
in october  we were awarded the department of veterans affairs first specialty network demonstration project  known as project hero healthcare effectiveness through resource optimization  to support healthcare delivery to veterans 
currently  we are anticipating a formal request for proposal  or rfp  for the tricare contracts 
we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain critical accounting principles and estimates impact our financial statements
