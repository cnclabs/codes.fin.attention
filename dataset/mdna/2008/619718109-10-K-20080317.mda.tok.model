item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report 
overview we design  develop  market and license memory intellectual property  or ip  used by the semiconductor industry 
our patented memory solutions include t sram and t flash high density alternatives to traditional volatile and non volatile embedded memory 
we license these technologies to companies that incorporate  or embed  memory on complex integrated circuits  such as systems on chips  or socs 
we have also sold memory chips based on our t sram technologies  but we ceased actively selling them in we do not expect to make and sell memory chips in the future 
our customers include semiconductor companies  idms  and foundries 
we generate revenue from the licensing of our ip  and our customers pay us fees for licensing  non recurring engineering services  royalties and maintenance and support 
royalty revenues are typically earned under our license agreements when our licensees manufacture or sell products that incorporate any of our technologies 
generally  we expect our total sales cycle  or the period from our initial discussion with a prospective licensee to our receipt of royalties from the licensee s use of our technologies  to run from to months 
the portion of our sales cycle from the initial discussion to the receipt of license fees may run from six to months  depending on the complexity of the proposed project and degree of development services required 
in  we began delivering our t sram classic memory macro products to licensees 
these macros are silicon proven  high density solutions offering customers rapid memory block integration into their soc designs 
they are pre configured and require minimal additional customization  and we believe they will enable us to increase our penetration of the market for very dense  low power  high speed embedded memory applications 
in july  we entered into an asset purchase agreement and a transition services agreement with atmel corporation atmel with respect to the purchase of several analog mixed signal integrated circuit designs and related assets from atmel  including the rights to acquire an atmel subsidiary located in romania that employed people and another atmel subsidiary located in shanghai  china that employed people at the time of purchase 
under the agreement  we made a cash payment of million  assumed net liabilities of acquired subsidiaries  and agreed to reimburse certain pre closing operating expenses for a total purchase price of approximately million 
in august  we acquired intellectual property and other assets from lsi design and integration corporation ldic in a transaction related to the atmel acquisition 
we acquired this technology and related assets in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock with the grant date fair value of per share 
of the  shares issued by us for the ldic acquisition  million which represents the  shares valued at has been recorded as intangible assets and the other  shares have been reserved for future distribution to employees and are being recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
we recorded the fair value of the  shares as part of the asset purchase consideration 
in addition  the agreement calls for an earn out payment equal to of the license and royalty revenues generated by us from the integrated circuit designs acquired from atmel and ldic that are recognized in the first calendar months following the closing date 
any such payments will be recorded as additional purchase consideration when earned 
sources of revenue we generate two types of revenue licensing and royalties 
licensing 
our license agreements involve long sales cycles  which makes it difficult to predict when the agreements will be signed 
in addition  our licensing revenues fluctuate from period to period  and it is difficult for us to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue from quarter to quarter 
moreover  we believe that the amount of licensing revenue for any period is not necessarily indicative of results in any future period 
our future revenue results are subject to a number of factors  particularly those described in part i  item a 
risk factors 
our licensing revenue consists of fees for providing circuit design  layout and design verification and granting a license to a customer for embedding our technology into its product 
license fees generally range from  to several million dollars per contract  depending on the scope and complexity of the development project  and the extent of the licensee s rights 
the licensee generally pays the license fees in installments at the beginning of the license term and upon the attainment of specified milestones 
the vast majority of our contracts allow for milestone billing based on work performed 
fees billed prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
royalty 
each of our license agreements provides for royalty payments at a stated rate 
we negotiate royalty rates by taking into account such factors as the anticipated volume of the licensee s sales of products utilizing our technologies and the cost savings to be achieved by the licensee through the use of our technology 
our license agreements generally require the licensee to report the manufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs 
as with our licensing revenue  the timing and level of royalties are difficult to predict 
they depend on the licensee s ability to market  produce and sell products incorporating our technology 
many of the products of our licensees that are currently subject to licenses from us are consumer products  such as electronic game consoles  for which demand can be seasonal and generally highest in the fourth quarter 
for a discussion of factors that could contribute to the fluctuation of our revenues  see part i  item a 
risk factors our lengthy licensing cycle and our licensees lengthy product development cycle will make the operating results of our licensing business difficult to predict  and anything that negatively affects the businesses of our licensees could negatively impact our revenue 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the accounting policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
these policies may involve estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual future results may differ from our estimates  and if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
revenue recognition general we generate revenue from the licensing of our ip  and customers pay fees for licensing  development services  royalties and maintenance and support 
during  we phased out sales of our proprietary memory chips and completed our final shipment of such products in early we apply the principles of sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of agreements 
when sales arrangements contain multiple elements eg  license and services  we apply the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine the separate units of accounting that exist within the agreement 
if more than one unit of accounting exists  the agreement consideration payable to us is allocated to each unit of accounting using either the relative fair value method or the residual fair value method as prescribed by eitf revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria of sab no 
have been met for that unit of accounting 
licensing licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements  development services and support and maintenance 
for license agreements that do not require significant development  modification or customization  revenues are generally recognized when the criteria of sab no 
have been met 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer revenue recognition until such time as all criteria have been met 
for license agreements that include deliverables that require significant production  modification or customization  we apply american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
when we have significant experience in meeting the design specification involved in the contract and the direct labor hours related to services under the contract can be reasonably estimated  we recognize revenue over the period in which we perform the contract services 
for these arrangements  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method includes judgmental elements  such as determining that we have the experience to meet the design specifications and estimation of the total direct labor hours 
we follow this method because we can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the direct labor hours to perform the contract services 
the direct labor hours for the development of the licensee s design are estimated at the beginning of the contract 
as these direct labor hours are incurred  they are used as a measure of progress towards completion 
we have the ability to reasonably estimate direct labor hours on a contract by contract basis from our experience in developing prior licensee s designs 
during the contract performance period  we review estimates of direct labor hours to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the direct labor hours to complete 
our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known 
under the percentage of completion method  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress 
significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours 
any changes in or deviation from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 
if the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method exceeds the amount of billings to a customer  then we account for the excess amount as an unbilled contract receivable 
our total unbilled contract receivable was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
if inherent risks make estimates doubtful  we must account for the contract under the completed contract method 
for contracts involving design specifications that we have not previously met  we defer the recognition of all revenue until the design meets the contractual design specifications and expense the cost of revenue as incurred 
when we have experience in meeting design specifications  but believe that we do not have significant experience to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours related to services to meet a design specification  we defer both the recognition of revenue and the cost 
for these arrangements  we recognize revenue using the completed contract method 
we recognized  of revenue under the completed contract method in in and  no revenue was recognized under the completed contract method 
we also provide support and maintenance under many of our license agreements 
under these arrangements  we provide unspecified upgrades  design rule changes and technical support 
no other upgrades  products or other post contract support are provided 
we recognize support and maintenance revenue at its fair value established by objective evidence  ratably over the period during which the obligation exists  typically months 
these arrangements are renewable annually by the customer 
revenue from support and maintenance was   and  in  and  respectively  and was included in licensing revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
from time to time  a licensee may cancel a project during the development phase 
such a cancellation is not within our control and is often caused by changes in market conditions or the licensee s business 
cancellations of this nature are an aspect of our licensing business  and  in general  license contracts allow us to retain all payments that we have received or are entitled to collect for items and services provided before the cancellation occurs 
typically under our license agreements  the licensee is obligated to complete the project within a stated timeframe  including assisting us in completing the final milestone  and if we perform the contracted services  is obligated to pay the license fees even if the licensee fails to complete verification or cancels the project prior to completion 
for accounting purposes we will consider a project to have been canceled even in the absence of specific notice from its licensee  if there has been no activity under the contract for six months or longer  and we believe that completion of the contract is unlikely 
in this event  we recognize revenue in the amount of cash received  if we have performed a sufficient portion of the development services 
if a cancelled contract had been entered into before the establishment of technological feasibility  the costs associated with the contract would have been expensed prior to the recognition of revenue 
in that case  there would be no costs associated with that revenue recognition  and gross margin would increase for the corresponding period 
license revenue from cancelled contracts was   and  for  and  respectively 
royalty licensing contracts also provide for royalty reporting and payments at a stated rate based on actual units manufactured or sold by licensees for products that include our technologies after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs 
we generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee s report 
however  due to a contract amendment with one customer in the fourth quarter of  we started to recognize royalty revenue for that customer in the same quarter in which the units are sold by this customer based on royalty reports received from the customer 
in addition  in the first quarter of  we began recognizing revenue from two types of prepaid royalties pre production royalties  which cover a fixed number of future unit shipments and are paid in a lump sum when we enter into the licensing contract  and post production royalties  which are paid in a lump sum after the licensee commences production of the royalty bearing product and applied against future unit shipments 
in either case  these prepaid royalties are non refundable 
revenue is recognized upon execution of the contract provided that no further performance obligations exist 
we record pre production  prepaid royalties as license revenues and post production  pre paid royalties as royalty revenues 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment  at least annually 
this assessment is subjective in nature and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results  projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels 
if our estimates and assumptions change in the future  it could result in a material write down of long lived assets 
we amortize our finite lived intangible assets  such as developed technology  patents and workforce  on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to five years 
we recognize an impairment charge as the difference between the net book value of such assets and the future undiscounted cash flows attributable the assets 
deferred tax valuation allowance when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our consolidated balance sheet under the category of other current assets 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon weighted available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of approximately million  of which approximately million was attributable to canadian loss and research and development pool carryforwards and million was attributable to us and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january  fin is an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
under fin  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
in accordance with our accounting policy  we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of other income and expense 
this policy did not change as a result of our adoption of fin stock based compensation we account for stock compensation costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payments  and apply the provisions of sab no 
upon adoption  we selected the modified prospective transition method  which requires us to recognize the fair value of the stock based compensation in net income loss in the current and future periods and not to restate the impact of the adoption on the prior period financial statements 
upon adoption  we began estimating the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the value of each employee stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes model for the purpose of the pro forma financial disclosure in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical and implied volatility of our stock price 
results of operations the following discussion compares the historical results of operations based on us generally accepted accounting principles for the years ended december   and revenues 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands licensing      percentage of total revenues licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements  development services and support and maintenance 
the million decrease in was primarily due to a significant decline in new customers and agreements for our classic macro products and t sram technology licenses 
we believe that licensing revenue from classic macros declined primarily because in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a royalty bearing technology license agreement with tsmc that allows them to develop and distribute t sram macro designs for which tsmc pays us royalties when they ship integrated circuits to their customers 
we believe this arrangement with tsmc ultimately will be beneficial because a substantial percentage of potential licensees for our basic it sram technologies will use tsmc for foundry services 
licensing revenue increased to million in from million in due to revenue recognized from several significant licensing contracts for our t sram technology on the nm and nm manufacturing processes in year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands royalty      percentage of total revenues royalty revenue represents amounts earned under provisions in our licensing contracts that require our licensees to report royalties and make payments at a stated rate based on actual units manufactured or sold by licensees for products that include our technologies 
we generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee s report 
royalty revenue increased million in primarily due to an increase in royalties earned on the sales of the nintendo wii game console which reached volume production in the last quarter of royalty revenue increased to million in from million in primarily due to a contract amendment with a customer  which allowed us to report royalty revenue one quarter earlier than the previous contract 
as a result of this contract amendment  additional royalty revenue representing of total revenue was recognized in  and in all subsequent future quarters  we will continue to recognize royalty revenue related to this amendment in the same quarter in which the units are sold 
in  the royalty earned from the production of nintendo gamecube chips decreased to of total revenue  compared to in  as the gamecube video game products approached the end of their product life cycles 
cost of net revenues and gross profit 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands cost of net revenue     percentage of total revenues cost of net revenues consists of personnel costs for engineers assigned to revenue generating licensing arrangements and related overhead allocation costs 
the increase in cost of net revenues for was primarily due to new licensing arrangements we entered into in  which required significantly increased engineering services 
those contracts required us to develop new memory macros for smaller manufacturing process geometries  and we incurred higher costs to fulfill our obligations 
cost of revenue in includes stock based compensation expense of million  an increase of million over as a result of the significant increase in engineering costs under new licensing arrangements  our gross profit decreased from million in to million in and  as a percentage of total revenue  decreased to of total revenue in from in we expect that cost of licensing revenues will continue to grow in absolute dollars and will be higher as a percentage of net revenue for because we anticipate entering into license agreements requiring more complete development services due to the shift by many licensees to smaller process geometries  including nm and below 
gross profit increased to million in from million in mainly due to an increase in our licensing revenue 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to in from in primarily due to a higher licensing gross profit  which increased to of total licensing revenue in from of total licensing revenue in this increase in licensing gross profit as a percentage of licensing revenue resulted from lower costs for fulfilling our obligations under large  high margin contracts and our classic memory macro projects 
this cost reduction was partially offset by stock based compensation expense of  recorded under sfas r 
there was no stock based compensation expense related to sfas r in in addition  pre production prepaid royalties included in licensing revenue contributed to an increased gross profit as a percentage of total revenue because such royalties have no associated cost 
research and development 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands research and development     percentage of total revenues our research and development expenses include development and design of variations of the t sram technologies for use in different manufacturing processes used by licensees  development of our t flash technology solution and costs related to our newly acquired analog mixed signal design technology  including the subsidiaries in china and romania  and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
the million increase in was primarily due to a substantial increase in newly hired personnel attributable to the atmel and ldic asset acquisitions in the third quarter of which added approximately one hundred employees 
the increase included million for contractually obligated bonuses and tape out charges for our high definition dvd mixed signal ip on a test integrated circuit  million of amortization of purchased intangible assets from these acquisitions  and an increase of million in stock based compensation expense 
in addition  we expanded our engineering team working on our non volatile t flash memory technology and t sram display driver applications 
research and development expenses included stock based compensation expense of million 
we will increase our development efforts in to enable the commercial launch of our new ip technologies  and we expect total research and development expense to increase significantly in as compared to  but to decrease slightly as a percentage of revenues 
the increase in research and development expenses for from was primarily attributable to a lower allocation of expenses to cost of licensing revenue in because of the high margin contracts  which requires less customization and engineering efforts 
research and development expenses also increased as a result of the stock based compensation expense of million under sfas r 
selling  general and administrative 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands selling  general and administrative    percentage of total revenues selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  customer support  finance  human resources and general management 
the increase for from resulted primarily from a million increase in bad debt expense attributable to one customer  a million increase in stock based compensation expense  million increase in legal fees related to employment matters  million increase in salary and related costs  million increase in marketing promotional activities and million of separation costs related to the departures of two executives 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in litigation expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for from was mainly due to stock based compensation expense of million under sfas r 
expenses related to the uniram litigation in totaled approximately million  compared to million in expenses related to testing and assessment of effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required by section of sarbanes oxley act were approximately  in stock based compensation 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r effective january   million and million were recognized as stock based compensation expense during the years ended december  and  respectively 
expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the total compensation cost of options granted  but not yet vested  as of december  was million  which is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of approximately years 
during the year ended december   we recorded stock based compensation expense of  which was attributable to the issuance of options to purchase our stock to newly appointed members of our board of directors that had an exercise price less than the fair market value of our stock on the date of the option grant  which was permitted under our option plan 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we amortized deferred compensation expense using the graded vesting method over the vesting period of each respective option  generally four years 
the accelerated amortization resulted in expensing approximately of the total award in the first year  in the second year  in the third year and in the fourth year 
acquired in process research and development 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands in process research and development percentage of total revenues we recorded a charge of million in for purchased in process research and development expenses upon completion of the atmel and ldic asset acquisitions because technological feasibility of the acquired technology had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
the fair value of the projects was determined by estimating the present value of the net cash flows we believed would result from the acquired technology 
litigation settlement 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands litigation settlement   percentage of total revenues in march  uniram technology  inc uniram filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california  alleging trade secret misappropriation and patent infringement 
in october  we entered into a settlement agreement with uniram under which we and uniram agreed to dismiss all outstanding claims and counterclaims with prejudice  and we paid uniram million and received a complete release of all claims as well as a future fully paid license for ourselves and all of our licensees with respect to uniram s relevant intellectual property 
interest  other income and expenses 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands interest  other income and expenses    percentage of total revenues the increase in interest  other income and expenses for was primarily due to a million increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments and a million decrease in other expenses due to a non recurring charge recorded in related to japan withholding taxes paid by japanese licensees on our behalf 
the increase in interest  other income and expenses for from was primarily due to higher interest rates but offset by a charge of million recorded in related to japan withholding taxes paid by japanese licensees on our behalf 
we do not expect any additional withholding tax reimbursement in the future as the us japan income tax treaty that took effect july  generally eliminated withholding taxes on royalties 
provision for income taxes 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands income tax benefit provision percentage of total revenues our income tax provisions for and were primarily attributable to foreign jurisdictions 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes  approximately million for state income tax purposes and canadian loss and research and development pool carryforwards of approximately million that are available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal  canadian and applicable state income tax laws 
these net operating loss carryforwards expire over our tax periods from to in  we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will continue to be less than the federal statutory tax rate 
as of december  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
because of uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets  we had a full valuation allowance of million as of december  and million as of december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million  resulting in a combined balance of million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million  resulting in a combined balance of million 
our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs 
as discussed in more detail under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  our short term investments at december  included million of adjustable rate securities that currently may be relatively illiquid 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our adjustable rate securities without significant loss  and we currently believe these securities are not impaired  primarily due to government guarantees of the underlying securities 
however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 
we currently have the ability and intent to hold our million of adjustable rate securities held as of february   until market stability is restored with respect to these securities 
we believe that  even allowing for the reclassification of these securities to long term and the possible requirement to hold all such securities for an indefinite period of time  our remaining cash and cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs and to execute our current business plan 
cash used in operating activities was million for and primarily consisted of the net loss of million  offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million  increases in non cash charges including the in process research and development charge of million  stock based compensation expense of million  million for depreciation and amortization and million of bad debt expense 
cash used in operating activities was million for and primarily consisted of the net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  reduced deferred revenue of million and decreased accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  partially offset by the non cash impacts of stock based compensation expense of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for and was primarily attributable to million of net proceeds from sales and purchases of marketable securities  partially offset by million of expenditures for property and equipment and million for the purchase of intangible and other assets from atmel and ldic in the third quarter of net cash provided by investing activities was million for  from sales of marketable securities of million  partially offset by million of purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities for was million and was primarily attributable to million of cash expenditures during the third and fourth quarters of to repurchase approximately  shares of our own common stock under a plan authorized by our board of directors in august  partially offset by proceeds of million from stock option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million  which was attributable to proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options 
our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter  depending on numerous factors  including level and timing of licensing and royalty revenues  cost  timing and success of technology development efforts  including meeting customer design specifications  market acceptance of our existing and future technologies and products  competing technological and market developments  cost of maintaining and enforcing patent claims and intellectual property rights  variations in manufacturing yields  materials costs and other manufacturing risks  costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations  and profitability of our business 
we expect that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments along with our existing capital and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we expect that a licensing business such as ours generally will require less cash to support operations 
however  we cannot be certain that we will not require additional financing at some point in time 
should our cash resources prove inadequate  we may need to raise additional funding through public or private financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could have a material  adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payment due by period total less than year years over years operating leases obligations  sublease income purchase commitment   the purchase commitment relates to a three year license agreement for computer aided design tools payable in installments through december off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the counter party from losses relating to a breach of representations and warranties  a failure to perform certain covenants  or claims and losses arising from certain external events as outlined within the particular contract  which may include  for example  losses arising from litigation or claims relating to past performance 
such indemnification clauses may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
we have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors 
no amounts are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of december  or related to these indemnifications 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our investment portfolio 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including us government agencies  municipal notes  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we do not use interest rate swaps in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer or fund 
our investment portfolio is classified as available for sale and is recorded at amortized cost 
securities with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents 
investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short term investments 
investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long term investments 
auction rate debt securities are classified as short term investments because they have fixed reset dates within one year designed to allow investors to exit these investments at par even though the underlying municipal note may have an original maturity as much as years 
all investments have a maturity of less than two years 
no single security should exceed of the portfolio at the time of purchase 
we do not have any investments denominated in foreign country currencies  and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments 
as of december   we held million of municipal notes investments  classified as short term investments  with an auction reset feature adjustable rate securities whose underlying assets were primarily in student loans and which had an aaa credit rating 
during january  we successfully liquidated million of these adjustable rate securities and  as of february   we held million of adjustable rate securities 
subsequently  auctions failed for all of these adjustable rate securities 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not do so as a result of a lack of buying demand 
as a result of auction failures  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining adjustable rate securities in the near term may be limited or not exist 
these developments may result in the classification of some or all of these securities as long term investments in our consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk currently  all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains or losses to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases  we may choose to hedge those exposures 
for most currencies  we are a net payer of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a stronger us dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker us dollar relative to those foreign currencies
