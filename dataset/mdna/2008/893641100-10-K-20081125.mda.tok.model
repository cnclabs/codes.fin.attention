item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data and td group s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under the heading entitled risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we believe we are a leading global designer  producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today 
our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers 
some of our more significant product offerings  substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end users in the aerospace industry  include mechanical electromechanical actuators and controls  ignition systems and components  gear pumps  specialized valves  engineered connectors  power conditioning devices  specialized fluorescent lighting and ac dc electric motors  aircraft audio systems  engineered latches and cockpit security devices  lavatory hardware and components  hold open rods and locking devices  specialized cockpit displays  elastomers  and nicad batteries chargers 
each of these product offerings consists of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 
for fiscal year  we generated net sales of million and net income of million 
in addition  for fiscal year  our ebitda was million  or of net sales  our ebitda as defined was million  or of net sales  and our capital expenditures were million  or of net sales 
see ebitda and ebitda as defined below for certain information regarding ebitda and ebitda as defined  including a reconciliation of ebitda and ebitda as defined to net income 
we estimate that over of our net sales for fiscal year were generated by proprietary products for which we own the design 
these products are generally approved and certified by airframe manufacturers who often certify only one manufacturer s component design for a specific application on an aircraft  government agencies and or the faa and similar entities or agencies 
in addition  for fiscal year  we estimate that we generated approximately of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 
most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue 
once our parts are designed into and sold as original equipment on an aircraft  we generate net sales from recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft 
this installed base and our sole source provider position generate a long term stream of aftermarket revenues over the estimated year life of an individual aircraft 
we estimate that approximately of our net sales in fiscal year were generated from aftermarket sales  the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets 
these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to oems 
in fiscal year  our top two customers accounted for approximately of our net sales  and during this same period our top ten customers accounted for approximately of our net sales 
however  our components are ultimately used on a large  diverse installed base of aircraft and  therefore  we are not overly dependent on any single airframe produced by any of our customers or other ultimate end users of our products 
in the commercial aerospace sector  which generated approximately of our net sales for fiscal year  we sell to distributors of aftermarket components  as well as directly to commercial airlines  aircraft maintenance facilities  systems suppliers  and aircraft and engine oems 
in addition  for fiscal year  approximately of our net sales were attributable to the defense aerospace sector 
net sales to the defense sector are generated primarily through sales to the united states and foreign militaries  brokers  distributors and defense oems 
the 
table of contents remaining portion of our net sales in fiscal year  or approximately of our net sales during this period  were derived from industries with similar niche engineered product characteristics such as the mining and power generation industries 
public offerings on may   certain of td group s stockholders  including certain members of our management  sold an aggregate of million shares of td group s common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of per share 
as a result of this offering  td group was no longer a controlled company for the purposes of the nyse listing requirements 
td group did not sell any shares in the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the offering

table of contents ebitda and ebitda as defined the following table sets forth the calculation of ebitda and ebitda as defined 
fiscal years ended september  in millions net income adjustments depreciation and amortization expense interest expense  net income tax provision ebitda adjustments acquisition related costs non cash compensation and deferred compensation costs public offering costs other ebitda as defined ebitda represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
represents costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses into td group s operations  purchase accounting adjustments to inventory that were charged to cost of sales when the inventory was sold and acquisition earnout costs 
the amount recognized for the earnout payment to howard skurka was pursuant to the terms of the retention agreement entered into with him in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of skurka in december represents the expenses recognized by the company under our stock option and deferred compensation plans 
represents costs and expenses incurred by td group related to the secondary offering in may represents the write down of certain property to its fair value that had been reclassified as held for sale in fiscal ebitda as defined represents ebitda plus  as applicable for the relevant period  inventory purchase accounting adjustments  acquisition integration costs  non cash compensation and deferred compensation costs  certain acquisition earnout costs  and expenses or charges incurred by us in connection with equity offerings  permitted investments  acquisitions  dispositions  recapitalizations  or permitted debt transactions 
our management uses ebitda as defined to review and assess our operating performance and management team in connection with our employee incentive programs and the preparation of our annual budget and our financial projections 
in addition  the revolving credit facility under the senior secured credit facility requires compliance  on a pro forma basis  with a first lien leverage ratio  which is measured based on our consolidated ebitda as defined therein 
the senior secured credit facility defines consolidated ebitda in a manner equal to how we defined ebitda as defined 
this financial covenant is a material term of the senior secured credit facility as failure to comply with such financial covenant could result in an event of default in respect of the revolving credit facility under the senior secured credit facility and  in turn  such an event of default could result in an event of default under the indenture 
although we use ebitda and ebitda as defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above  the use of ebitda and ebitda as defined as an analytical tool has limitations  and you should not consider either of them in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with gaap 
some of these limitations are neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined reflects the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments  on our indebtedness  
table of contents although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements  the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of ebitda and ebitda as defined  neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined includes the payment of taxes  which is a necessary element of our operations  and ebitda as defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations  which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions 
because of these limitations  ebitda and ebitda as defined should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
management compensates for these limitations by not viewing ebitda or ebitda as defined in isolation  and specifically by using other gaap measures  such as net income  net sales and operating profit  to measure our operating performance 
neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined is a measurement of financial performance under gaap and neither should be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with gaap  and our calculation of ebitda and ebitda as defined may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
trend information we predominantly serve customers in the commercial aerospace oem market  which accounts for approximately of total sales and includes large commercial transport manufacturers and regional  business jet manufacturers  the commercial  regional  business jet and general aviation aftermarket  which accounts for approximately of total sales  and the defense market  which accounts for approximately of total sales 
non aerospace sales comprise approximately of our total sales 
the commercial aerospace industry  including the oem market and aftermarket  is impacted by the health of the global economy and geo political events around the world 
although the commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles  or rpms  between and the first half of  as well as increases in oem production and backlog  rising fuel prices  the global economic downturn  airline capacity reductions and concerns over the financial credit markets have negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry 
the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints  the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts 
it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 
our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk 
we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry  and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft  which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform 
at times  declines in sales in one sector have been offset by increased sales in another 
however  due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers  variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 
there are many short term factors including inventory corrections  unannounced changes in order patterns  strikes and mergers and acquisitions that can cause short term disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years 
to normalize for short term fluctuations  we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discreet short term periods 
as such  it can be difficult to determine longer term trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons 
there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quarter to quarter  as well as variations in product mix from quarter to quarter  that may cause positive or negative variations in 
table of contents gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems 
again  in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 
commercial oem market there is industry consensus that aircraft deliveries in the large commercial transport market sector aircraft with or more seats may reach its peak in and that deliveries may be flat or decrease going forward 
another indicator of future oem sales in this market is the order backlog at the boeing company and airbus sas despite a significant number of airplanes in the backlog  current year orders for new airplanes has decreased from the prior year and the availability of financing is uncertain due to the current state of the credit markets  indicating that oem production may be somewhat lower than originally anticipated 
in addition  although the labor strike at boeing has concluded  we believe we will lose two to three months of effective production in our fiscal commercial oem sales from the strike 
furthermore  the business jet oem market may also peak in and decrease thereafter 
this market similarly appears to have been negatively impacted by a slowdown in economic growth  corporate profits  commodity prices and stock market returns across the world and we may see corresponding reductions in production 
commercial aftermarket the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft 
although rpms increased annually between and the first half of  industry consensus indicates that may show flat to modest negative growth as a result of expected reductions in air traffic and capacity due to the increasing cost of fuel and the slowdown in the global economy 
industry reports expect rpms to stabilize in and return to positive growth thereafter 
defense in recent years  defense spending has reached historic highs  due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism 
our military business fluctuates from year to year  and is dependent  to a degree  on government budget constraints  the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts 
we anticipate that military related sales of our types of products will experience modest growth in over the current high levels 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods 
management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
however  investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods  assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends 
these critical policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
our most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition and related allowances substantially all of our revenues are recognized based upon shipment of products to the customer  at which time title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm  fixed price purchase orders received from customers 
provisions for returns  uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified  as appropriate  by the most current information available 
we have a history of making reasonably dependable 
table of contents estimates of such allowances  however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness 
the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers 
management s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified losses and a general amount for estimated losses based on historical information 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management 
if circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate  management may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products 
the warranty period for products sold varies throughout the company s operations  ranging from days to six years 
in addition  certain contracts with distributors contain right of return provisions 
the company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources 
the company also provides a general amount based on historical results 
historically  actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the first in  first out fifo methods for all locations except cef  which determines the cost of inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in service for or more years  it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on our analysis of inventory levels  past usage and future sales forecasts 
although management believes that the company s estimates of obsolete and slow moving inventory are reasonable  actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future 
in addition  in accordance with industry practice  all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales  even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year 
intangible assets mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed or exchanged  regardless of the company s intent to do so 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and  under financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 
the determination of undiscounted cash flows is based on the company s strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the plans are based on industry and company specific data 
the profit margin assumptions included in the plans are projected based on the current cost structure and anticipated cost changes 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and the recognition of an impairment loss might be required 
intangible assets  such as goodwill  trademarks and trade names that have an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
stock options and deferred compensation plans the company accounts for the cost of its stock options under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based on the fair value of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the options vesting periods 
in addition  the company accounts for the cost of the deferred compensation plans of td group in accordance with opinion no 
of the accounting principles board  which requires the cost of deferred compensation arrangements to be accrued over the service period of the related employees in a systematic and rational manner 

table of contents purchase accounting our mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method 
accordingly  fair value adjustments to the company s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in its consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition 
we generally use third party appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value adjustments 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data of the company  including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales  amounts in thousands fiscal years ended of sales of sales of sales net sales cost of sales selling and administrative amortization of intangibles refinancing costs income from operations interest expense  net income tax provision net income fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year sales growth excluding acquisitions was million and represented an increase over the prior year 
the organic sales growth was primarily due to i an increase of million of military sales primarily resulting from increased demand for aftermarket spare parts across most of our product lines  ii an increase of million of commercial oem sales primarily resulting from an increase in production rates from the boeing company and airbus sas and related oem suppliers  and iii an increase of million of commercial aftermarket sales despite being negatively impacted by an increase in the replacement time period for certain cockpit security components  as well as  modest system wide inventory fluctuations 
the remaining million increase in net sales resulted from the acquisition of cef in fiscal and the businesses of ati and bruce industries in fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from from fiscal year cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales of million discussed above  partially offset by a million decrease  or of net sales  in acquisition related costs 
the decrease in acquisition related expenses was primarily due to inventory purchase accounting charges and integration costs recorded in the prior year of million related to the acquisitions of ati and cda partially offset by current year inventory purchase accounting charges and integration costs of million primarily related to the acquisitions of bruce and cef 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily due a decrease from acquisition related costs discussed above  the strength of the company s proprietary products and continued productivity efforts  partially offset by the impact from the acquisitions of ati  bruce and cef 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year this increase was primarily 
table of contents due to the higher sales discussed above and an increase in research and development expenses of million primarily relating to the boeing program  partially offset by the non recurring charge of million relating to the secondary offering recorded in the prior year 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles decreased by million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year income from operations 
operating income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to higher sales and other factors described above 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due to an increase in our debt of approximately million from the acquisition ati in february  partially offset by lower interest rates and higher interest income of million 
the company s weighted average level of outstanding borrowings was approximately billion during fiscal compared to approximately billion during the comparable period last year while the average interest rate decreased to approximately during fiscal from for the comparable period last year see liquidity and capital resources below 
income taxes 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in state and local taxes  an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction and the favorable resolution of a prior year irs audit and state tax refund of million partially offset by a lower research and development tax credit 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  primarily as a result of the factors referred to above 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year sales growth excluding acquisitions was million and represented a increase over the prior year 
the organic sales growth was primarily due to i an increase of million of commercial aftermarket sales resulting from the strong underlying demand in the worldwide commercial aerospace market and the strength of our proprietary products and market position  ii an increase of million of commercial oem sales primarily resulting from the increase in the business jet market  and iii an increase of million of military sales 
the remaining million increase resulted from the acquisitions of the businesses of cda  ati  and bruce industries in fiscal and businesses of electra motion and sweeney in fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from from fiscal year cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased approximately percentage points to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the absolute dollar increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales of million discussed above  a million charge  or of net sales  that resulted from inventory purchase price accounting charges pertaining to the acquisitions of the businesses of cda  ati and bruce industries and an increase in acquisition integration costs of approximately million relating to recent acquisitions 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily due to favorable product mix on the increase in commercial aftermarket sales  productivity improvements and to a lesser extent  favorable fixed cost leverage on greater volume 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the prior year period included non recurring costs of million for a one time special bonus and million of costs associated 
table of contents with the initial public offering 
these prior year costs were partially offset by a million reversal of charges resulting from the termination of two deferred compensation plans in fiscal the net reduction of prior year non operating activity of approximately million  or of prior year net sales  was partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative costs associated with higher sales volume discussed above  higher research and development costs of million  or of net sales  relating to the boeing and other new programs and million  or of net sales  of costs associated with the secondary offering 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for fiscal year from for the comparable period last year  primarily due to the factors described above 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles increased by million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the additional identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with the acquisitions of the businesses of cda  ati and bruce industries  of which million related to order backlog amortization that is typically amortized over months 
refinancing costs 
refinancing costs represented a one time charge that was recorded in june as a result of the refinancing of transdigm s entire debt structure 
the charge of million consisted of the premium of million paid to redeem our senior subordinated notes and the write off of million of debt issue costs associated with our former senior credit facility  our senior subordinated notes and the td group loan facility and other expenses of million 
income from operations 
operating income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to higher sales  the refinancing costs of million recorded in fiscal  and other factors described above 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the net increase was primarily the result of an increase of our outstanding borrowings of approximately million related to the acquisition of ati in february  partially offset by lower interest rates from the refinancing of our debt structure during june the company s weighted average level of outstanding borrowings increased to approximately billion during fiscal from approximately million during fiscal  while the average interest rate decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal income taxes 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to lower state and local taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes and a decrease in nondeductible public offering expenses 
these reductions were partially offset by an income tax benefit of million  or of the income before income taxes  recorded in fiscal resulting from the adoption of a change in texas tax law enacted in may net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  primarily as a result of the refinancing in fiscal and other factors referred to above 
backlog as of september   the company estimated its sales order backlog at million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of million as of september  this increase in backlog of million is primarily due to the acquisitions of the businesses of cef and unison discussed above totaling approximately million 
the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september  are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months 
purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the 
table of contents customer prior to shipment 
the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled 
accordingly  the company s backlog as of september  may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 
foreign operations although we manufacture substantially all of our products in the united states  we manufacture some products in malaysia through our wholly owned malaysian subsidiary 
we sell our products in the united states  as well as in foreign countries 
substantially all of our foreign sales are transacted in us dollars and  therefore  we have no material exposure to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar as a result of foreign sales 
in addition the amount of components or other raw materials or supplies that we purchase from foreign suppliers  including our malaysian manufacturing subsidiary  are not material  with substantially all such transactions being made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have no material exposure to currency fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar arising from these transactions 
our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments countries 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 
inflation many of the company s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation  which could result in changing operating costs 
the effects of inflation on the company s businesses during the fiscal years  and were not significant 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
the company generated million of cash from operating activities during fiscal compared to million generated during fiscal the increase of million in fiscal is primarily due to an increase in net income of million and favorable changes in accounts receivable and inventory of approximately million 
we generated million of cash from operating activities during fiscal compared to million generated during fiscal the increase of million is primarily due to i the absence in of the million of interest paid in fiscal relating to the senior unsecured promissory notes  ii the absence in of the distributions to participants in our deferred compensation plans totaling approximately million in november in connection with the distributions under the deferred compensation plans  our board of directors approved the termination of the plans during the first quarter of fiscal  iii the absence in of the payment in november of a one time special bonus to certain members of management of million  and iv the increase in operating cash flows from higher sales and other factors 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities decreased to million during fiscal consisting of the acquisitions of the businesses of cef for million and unison for million discussed above and capital expenditures of million 
cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal consisting of the acquisitions of the businesses of ati  cda and bruce industries for a total of million discussed above and capital expenditures of million 
cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal consisting of the acquisitions of the businesses of sweeney and electra motion for million and capital expenditures of million 

table of contents financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was million compared to cash generated in financing activities of million in fiscal the cash provided by financing activities during fiscal related to the exercise of stock options 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was million compared to cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal the cash provided by financing activities during fiscal consisted of the proceeds received of million  net of fees  from the issuance of additional senior subordinated notes and additional term loans of million  net of fees  to finance the acquisition of ati and million related to the exercise of stock options 
the cash used in financing activities during fiscal of million was primarily due to i the use of million associated with the refinancing in june  and ii the repayment of the unsecured promissory notes of million 
the cash used in these financing activities in june was partially offset by the proceeds from td group loan facility of million and million related to the exercise of stock options 
description of current senior secured credit facility and indenture in june transdigm refinanced its entire debt structure 
in connection with the refinancing  transdigm inc obtained a new senior secured credit facility the senior secured credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility consisted of a million term loan facility  which was fully drawn at closing  and a million revolving loan facility 
in addition  under the terms of the senior secured credit facility  transdigm inc had the right to request but no lender was committed to provide additional term loans of up to million  subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions  including pro forma compliance with the financial covenant contained in the senior secured credit facility after giving effect to any such incremental term loan borrowings 
in connection with the acquisition of ati in february  transdigm inc entered into an amendment of the senior secured credit facility  which provided for  among other things  i an additional term loan of million  ii a million increase in the revolving credit facility bringing the total available revolver to million  and iii a million increase in the uncommitted incremental loan facility to million 
at september   million of the revolving credit facility was available 
the term loan facility  including the additional borrowings in february  will mature in june and will not be subject to interim scheduled amortization  but will be subject to certain prepayment requirements 
under the amended terms of the senior secured credit facility  commencing days after the end of fiscal and each fiscal year thereafter  transdigm inc is required to prepay outstanding term loans in a principal amount equal to of excess cash flow as defined  provided that the amount of the prepayment will be reduced to of excess cash flow if the consolidated leverage ratio as defined at the end of the applicable fiscal year is less than to  but greater than to  and transdigm inc will not be required to prepay any of the term loan of the consolidated leverage ratio as of the end of the applicable fiscal year is equal to or less than to or if the term loan achieves certain minimum credit ratings at the end of such fiscal year 
transdigm s consolidated leverage ratio is less than to at september   thus the company is not obligated to make the prepayment of the term loans based upon the excess cash flow provision
