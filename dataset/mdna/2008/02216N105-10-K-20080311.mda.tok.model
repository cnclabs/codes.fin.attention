item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with the selected consolidated financial data included in item above and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this document  particularly in item a above 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of oral and injectable protein therapeutics for gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders  with three product candidates in clinical development 
we are using our proprietary protein crystallization technology to develop protein therapies  which we believe will have significant advantages over existing products and will address unmet medical needs 
our product candidates are designed to either increase the amount of a protein that is in short supply in the body or degrade and remove toxic metabolites from the blood stream 
our three most advanced product candidates are trizytek tm 
porcine free enzymes 
formerly altu  for which we initiated a phase iii efficacy clinical trial in cystic fibrosis patients for the treatment of malabsorption due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in may and two long term phase iii safety studies in june  altu  for which we have completed a phase ii clinical trial in adults for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency  and altu  for which we initiated a phase i clinical trial for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria and enteric hyperoxaluria in august we also have a pipeline of other product candidates in preclinical research and development 
on january   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately million  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 

table of contents during april  we completed a common stock offering in which we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million net of underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
our future operating results will largely depend on the progress of our product candidates in the clinical development process and our ability to raise sufficient capital to fund operations 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and from quarter to quarter and depend on  among other factors our level of investment in pre clinical and clinical research and development  our success in manufacturing drug supplies and procuring the active pharmaceutical ingredients for our products  and the outcome of the clinical trials we conduct 
we have generated significant losses as we have advanced our lead product candidates into clinical development and expect to continue to generate losses as trizytek completes its clinical development and we prepare for the filing of a new drug application  or nda  and altu and altu move into later stages of clinical development 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate that existing capital resources at december  should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into mid our ability to continue to fund planned operations is dependant upon our ability to raise additional funds through equity  debt or other sources of financing  enter into future collaborations with third parties for the development of our clinical candidates  and to control our cash burn rate 
financial operations overview contract revenue 
we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products until the launch of trizytek  if ever 
our contract revenue consists of amounts earned under current and former collaborative research and development agreements relating to trizytek and altu in february  we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics  inc  or cffti  to collaborate on the development of trizytek and specified derivatives of trizytek in north america for the treatment of malabsorption due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in patients with cystic fibrosis and other indications 
the agreement  in general terms  provides us with funding from cffti for a portion of the development costs of trizytek upon the achievement of specified development milestones  up to a total of million  in return for specified payment obligations and our obligation to use good faith reasonable efforts to develop and bring trizytek to market in north america 
as of december   we had received a total of million of the million available under the cffti agreement and recognized cumulative revenue of million 
under the terms of the agreement  we may receive an additional milestone payment of million  less an amount determined by when we achieve the milestone 
if we are successful in obtaining united states food and drug administration  or fda  approval of trizytek  we will be required to pay cffti a license fee equal to the aggregate amount of milestone payments we have received from cffti  plus interest  up to a maximum of million  less the fair market value of the shares of common stock underlying the warrants we issued to cffti 
this fee  plus interest on the unpaid balance  will be due in four annual installments  commencing days after the approval date 
we are also required to pay an additional million to cffti within days after the approval date 
in addition  we are obligated to pay royalties to cffti consisting of a percentage of worldwide net sales by us or our sublicensees of trizytek for any and all indications until the expiration of specified united states patents covering trizytek 
we have the option to terminate our ongoing royalty obligation by making a one time payment to cffti  but we currently do not expect to do so 
under the agreement  cffti has also agreed to provide us with reasonable access to its network of medical providers  patients  researchers and others involved in the care and treatment of cystic fibrosis patients  and to use reasonable efforts to promote the involvement of these parties in the development of trizytek 
in connection with the execution of the cffti agreement and the first amendment of the agreement  we have issued to cffti warrants to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  including  warrants with a fair value of million issued at the time of the agreement in february the fair value of the  warrants is being recognized as a discount to 
table of contents contract revenue and amortized against the gross revenue earned under the contract 
as of december   approximately million remains to be amortized against future revenues under the agreement 
in december  cffti and we amended the agreement again to provide us with an interest bearing advance against a future milestone 
this million advance was paid to us in january and is included in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet 
the advance  including interest at an annual rate of  will be deducted from the milestone at the time the milestone is earned 
in addition to the amounts deducted from the future milestone  and in the event trizytek is approved  we will pay to cffti an amount equal to the advance in addition to the amounts otherwise owed to cffti 
if the milestone is not achieved or trizytek is not approved  we have no obligation to cffti as a result of this amendment 
in december  we entered into a development  commercialization and marketing agreement with dr 
falk pharma gmbh  or dr 
falk  for the development by us of trizytek and the commercialization by dr 
falk of trizytek  if approved  in europe  the countries of the former soviet union  israel and egypt 
under the agreement  we granted dr 
falk an exclusive  sublicensable license under specified patents to commercialize trizytek for the treatment of symptoms caused by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency  which we refer to as the european marketing rights 
during the period from december through october  we received upfront and milestone payments from dr 
falk under the agreement totaling million  which equated to million based on exchange rates in effect at the times we received the milestone payments 
under the terms of the agreement  we could have received additional milestone payments of million  as well as royalties on net sales of trizytek by dr 
falk 
effective june   dr 
falk and we agreed to terminate the agreement outside the provisions of the original agreement  and we reacquired dr 
falk s european marketing rights 
dr 
falk and we had differing views regarding the optimal development and commercialization path in europe  and ultimately concluded that reacquisition of the development and commercialization rights by us would be in the best interest of both parties 
under the terms of the termination agreement  we agreed to pay dr 
falk a total of million in installments through we will not recognize any further revenue under the agreement and will not receive any further milestone or royalty payments 
at the time of the termination agreement  we recorded a net liability of million  which reflects the net present value of our cash payment obligations to dr 
falk 
this amount was expensed in the second quarter of  net of a reversal of million of deferred revenue representing the remaining balance associated with the non refundable upfront and milestone payments received from dr 
falk 
in december  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with genentech  inc  or genentech  for the development  manufacture and commercialization of altu the effective date of the agreement was february   following expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted genentech exclusive rights and license to make and have made  use and import altu  and to sell altu in north america if approved by the fda 
genentech had the option to expand the agreement to a global agreement 
the agreement  in general terms  provided that genentech would assume full responsibility for the development  manufacture and commercialization of altu under the agreement  we had the option to elect to co promote altu in north america 
pursuant to the agreement  genentech made the following specific cash payments to us in a million upfront non refundable license fee payment  million in exchange for  shares of our common stock  and million to reimburse us for various development activities performed by us on genentech s behalf 
in addition  genentech is obligated to make an additional payment to us in to reimburse us for development activities performed on its behalf in the fourth quarter of on december   genentech and we entered into an agreement terminating the collaboration effective december  under the terms of the termination agreement  we reacquired the north american development and commercialization rights to altu  and the option to expand the agreement to a global agreement expired unexercised 
in addition  genentech agreed to provide  for a limited time  supplies 
table of contents of human growth hormone for further clinical development of altu in north america and clinical development and commercialization purposes outside north america and to pay us a million termination payment to fund the transition of the project back to us 
upon commercialization  genentech will be entitled to a nominal royalty on sales of altu before we entered into the termination agreement  we did not recognize any revenue related to the upfront payment or reimbursement for development activities performed on genentech s behalf  because provisions in the original agreement precluded us from concluding that revenue was fixed and determinable 
as a result of the termination of the collaborative agreement  the amount of revenue we will receive is now fixed and determinable  and our estimated performance period under the amended agreement has changed to coincide with the december  effective date 
accordingly  we have recognized revenue of million in december  comprised of the original upfront payment of million and cost reimbursements for development work performed on genentech s behalf of million 
in addition  we recognized a gain on the termination of the agreement of million 
in the future  we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of license fees  research and development funding  milestone payments and royalties resulting from strategic collaborations we may enter into relating to the development of products that incorporate our intellectual property  and from sales of any products that we successfully develop and commercialize  either alone or in collaboration 
we expect that any revenues we generate will fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payment  if any  received under any future strategic collaborations and licensing arrangements  and the amount and timing of payments that we receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of expenses incurred in developing and testing product candidates  including salaries and related expenses for personnel  including stock based compensation expenses  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of materials used in clinical and non clinical trials  performance of non clinical trials  including toxicity studies in animals  and depreciation of equipment used to develop our products and costs of facilities 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we initiated a phase iii efficacy clinical trial of the capsule form of trizytek in may  plus two long term safety studies in june our current estimate of the total costs we will incur to complete the development of trizytek and file an nda with the fda is approximately million  excluding non cash compensation expense and depreciation  which represents an increase of approximately million over our estimate at december  the increase is primarily due to unexpected increases in the estimated costs of third party sourced materials needed to manufacture trizytek for nda approval  the cost of establishing a third party manufacturer of gmp materials to support our commercial product requirements  the cost of using third party contract research organizations to conduct phase iii clinical trials  changes in patient recruitment assumptions in order to run statistically valid clinical trials and regulatory costs associated with the filing of an nda  due to the loss of orphan drug status 
the possibility exists that we may revise this estimate again in the future 
as of december   we had incurred approximately million of these total costs 
we have also completed a phase ii clinical trial of altu from january   the date on which we began separately tracking development costs for altu  through december   we incurred approximately million in total development costs for this product candidate 

table of contents we initiated a phase i clinical trial for altu in august from january   the date on which we began separately tracking development costs for altu  through december   we have incurred approximately million in total development costs for this product candidate 
we expect our research and development costs to increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we complete our phase iii trials for trizytek  advance altu and altu through clinical trials and continue the development of our pre clinical pipeline 
the amount and timing of resources we devote to our clinical and preclinical product candidates in the future will be influenced by our ability to fund further development activities  or the potential to enter into one or more strategic collaborations that would provide full or partial funding for the development of our product candidates 
product candidates in clinical development have higher associated development costs than those in the preclinical stage since the former involve testing on humans while the latter involve shorter term animal studies 
moreover  as a product candidate moves into later stage clinical trials  such as from phase i to phase ii or phase ii to phase iii  the costs are significantly higher due to the increased size and length of the later stage trials 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of altu  altu or any of our preclinical product candidates  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows will commence 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the potential benefits of our product candidates over other therapies  our ability to manufacture  market  commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the expense and timing of regulatory approvals  the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the availability of sufficient capital resources to fund development activities 
a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
general  sales and administrative expense 
general  sales and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel  including stock based compensation expenses  in our executive  sales  marketing  finance  accounting  information technology and human resource functions 
other costs primarily include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  corporate insurance  advertising and promotion expenses  trade shows and professional fees for accounting and legal services  including patent related expenses 
while we expect future general and administrative costs to rise  we expect that the rate of increase in our general and administrative expenses will decline as we leverage our investments in personnel and infrastructure

reacquisition of european marketing rights from dr 
falk pharma gmbh 
in conjunction with the termination of our collaborative agreement with dr 
falk in june  we reacquired the european marketing rights for trizytek in exchange for cash payments totaling million  which equated to million based on exchange rates at the time of the termination agreement  over a three year period 
the net present value of these payments converted to us dollars on the date of the termination of the collaboration and discounted at our incremental borrowing rate of was million 
due to the uncertainty associated with receiving potential future cash flows from the commercialization of trizytek under the reacquired european marketing rights  we expensed this cost in the second quarter of this expense was reduced by the reversal of million of deferred revenue  representing the remaining balance associated with the non refundable upfront and milestone payments received from dr 
falk  since we no longer have any remaining performance obligations under the original agreement 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on capital leases and equipment loans  and amortization of the discount associated with our obligation to dr 
falk 
preferred stock dividends and accretion 
preferred stock dividends and accretion consists of cumulative but undeclared dividends payable and accretion of the issuance costs and warrants  where applicable  on our redeemable preferred stock and series b and c convertible preferred stock 
the issuance costs on these shares and warrants were recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the preferred stock when issued  and are accreted to preferred stock ratably through december  by a charge to additional paid in capital and earnings attributable to common stockholders 
upon the completion of our initial public offering on january   the series b and series c convertible preferred stock converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock  and the cumulative but unpaid dividends on the series b and c convertible preferred stock were satisfied through the issuance of  shares of common stock at the price of the common stock sold in the offering 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements and notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  accrued expenses  deemed fair valuation of stock related to stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
contract revenue 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
sab no 
revenue recognition  emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and eitf issue no 
eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
contract revenue includes revenue from collaborative license and development agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and other organizations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates as well as non refundable research and development funding under these collaborative agreements 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical development and commercial milestones and 
table of contents royalties on product sales 
research and development funding generally reimburses us for a portion or all of the development and testing related to the collaborative research programs 
collaborative agreements often contain multiple elements  providing for a license as well as research and development  regulatory and commercialization services 
such arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf we recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  provided that the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have standalone value or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the upfront license payments are recognized as revenue over the estimated period performance obligations are performed 
when we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue related to upfront license and other payments will be recognized 
revenue is only recognized to the extent it is fixed and determinable and is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned as of the period end date 
we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method provided we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
under the proportional performance method  periodic revenue related to upfront license and other payments is recognized based on the percentage of actual effort expended in that period to total effort budgeted for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
we use an input based measure  specifically direct costs  to determine proportional performance because  for our current agreements accounted for under this method  the use of an input based measure is a more accurate representation of proportional performance than an output based measure  such as milestones 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete the related performance obligations 
management reassesses its estimates quarterly and makes judgment based on the best information available 
estimates may change in the future based on changes in facts and circumstances  resulting in a change in the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
we use the proportional performance method of revenue recognition for our collaborations for the development of trizytek 
since the inception of our collaboration agreements with cffti and dr 
falk  we have adjusted our estimated costs to complete the development program for trizytek on five occasions  including during the third quarters of  and  resulting in cumulative adjustments in revenue each time 
during the third quarter of  we reduced our estimated development costs for trizytek  which resulted in us increasing cumulative revenue by million in the third quarter of during the third quarters of and  we increased our estimated development costs for trizytek  which resulted in us decreasing cumulative revenue by million and million in the third quarters of and  respectively 
the possibility exists that revenue may increase or decrease in future periods as estimated costs of the underlying program increase or decrease or as exchange rates impact the value of foreign currency denominated collaborations  without additional cash inflows from the collaborative partner or non government institution 
for example  as of december   if our estimated total development costs for trizytek were to increase by  it would result in a million reduction of cumulative revenue 
if our estimated total development costs for trizytek were to decrease by  it would result in a million increase in cumulative revenue 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement  the performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis and we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential  then revenue would be recognized on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 

table of contents collaborations may also involve substantive milestone payments 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance bonuses that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone and a reasonable amount of time passes between the upfront license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment 
reimbursement of research and development costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of eitf issue no 
are met  the amounts are fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalties received based on sales of licensed products are recognized when due and payable assuming we have no further contractual obligations and the amount of revenue is fixed and determinable 
contract amounts which are not due until the customer accepts or verifies the research results are not recognized as revenue until payment is received or the customer s acceptance or verification of the results is evidenced  whichever occurs earlier 
in the event warrants are issued in connection with a collaborative agreement  contract revenue is recorded net of amortization of the related warrants 
deferred revenue consists of payments received in advance of revenue recognized under collaborative agreements 
since the payments received under the collaborative agreements are non refundable  the termination of a collaborative agreement prior to its completion could result in an immediate recognition of deferred revenue relating to payments already received from the collaborative partner but not previously recognized as revenue 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include contract service fees  such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations  clinical sites and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of materials for clinical and non clinical trials  and professional service fees 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
in the event that we do not identify costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high  and revenue may be overstated or understated to the extent such expenses relate to collaborations accounted for using the proportional performance method 
the date on which specified services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services is often judgmental 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of inaccurate estimates  in part  by communicating with our service providers when other evidence of costs incurred is unavailable 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payments  or sfas r  as required  using the modified prospective application method 
we continue to determine the fair value of the equity instruments using the black scholes option pricing model and to recognize compensation cost ratably over the appropriate vesting period 
before january   we accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  which are similar to those in sfas r 
as a result  the impact of the adoption of sfas r did not have a material impact on our comparative results 
we account for transactions in which goods and services are received in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such goods and services received or the deemed fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
the fair value is recorded as stock based compensation expense 
table of contents ratably over the vesting period 
when equity instruments are granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services and the value of those goods or services can not be readily estimated  as is true in connection with most stock options and warrants granted to employees  directors  consultants and other non employees  we determine the fair value of the equity instruments using all relevant information  including application of the black scholes option pricing model and  in specified situations  input from valuation specialists  all of which require various estimates and assumptions 
different estimates and assumptions can yield materially different results 
the factors which most affect charges or credits to operations related to stock based compensation include the deemed fair value of the common stock underlying the equity instruments for which stock based compensation is recorded  the volatility of such deemed fair value  the estimated life of the equity instrument  and the assumed risk free rate of return 
because shares of our common stock were not publicly traded before our initial public offering in january  before that date the fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes was determined by our board of directors 
factors that we considered when determining the fair value of our common stock included pricing of private sales of our convertible preferred stock  prior valuations of stock grants and convertible preferred stock sales and the effect of events  including the progression of our product candidates  that had occurred between the time of the grants or sales  comparative rights and preferences of the security being granted compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity  comparative values of public companies discounted for the risk and limited liquidity provided for in the shares issued  perspective provided by valuation specialists  any perspective provided by any investment banks  including the likelihood of an initial public offering and the potential value of the company in an initial public offering  and general economic trends 
if our estimates of the deemed fair value of these equity instruments or other judgments and assumptions had been too high or too low  it would have had the effect of overstating or understating expenses 
the fair value of our equity instruments  excluding preferred stock  granted prior to our consideration of a public offering was historically determined by our board of directors based upon information available to it on the measurement dates 
however  in  we performed a retrospective analysis to determine the deemed fair market value of our common stock for accounting purposes in light of the potential for an initial public offering 
this retrospective analysis addressed the deemed fair market value of our common stock at key points in time in and we performed our analysis in accordance with several elements of a practice aid issued by the american institute of certified public accountants entitled valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation 
we used two primary valuation methodologies within the market approach in the practice aid  including a guideline public company analysis  or comparable company ipo analysis  and a guideline transactions analysis  or comparable company m a analysis  to determine the estimated deemed fair market value of our equity during the period discussed above 
we then allocated value between the preferred stock and the common stock under each analysis and arrived at the value of the common stock based on a probability weighted expected return methodology 
now that our common stock is publicly traded  we use the value of that stock to determine the fair value of any equity instruments we issue 
upon the initial filing of our s registration statement on october   we began utilizing a volatility factor in valuing options granted to employees 
before such date  we had excluded a volatility factor  as permitted for private companies under the provisions of sfas no 
the use of a volatility factor increases our employee stock based compensation expense when valuing options granted to employees since the initial filing of our s registration statement 
we assess our volatility factor each reporting period and a change from one period to another may cause our stock based compensation to increase or decrease 

table of contents income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december   we had federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire starting in  federal research and development credit carryforwards of million and total net deferred tax assets of million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as an offset against these otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit 
in the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which such a determination is made 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and credits available to be used in any given year in the event of a change in ownership 
results of operations years ended december   and contract revenue years ended december  increase decrease to to dollars in thousands contract revenue overview contract revenue is associated with our existing collaboration agreement with cffti for trizytek and our former collaboration agreements with dr 
falk for trizytek and genentech for altu revenue related to the cffti and dr 
falk collaborations is recognized under the proportional performance method 
under this methodology  to the extent we incur direct development costs each year to advance trizytek  we recognize revenue based on the proportion of actual costs spent to our estimate of total direct development costs 
contract revenue recognized under the proportional performance method fluctuates from year to year due to two factors a the level of development spending on trizytek  which directly correlates to revenue recognized  and b changes to our estimate in total direct development costs for trizytek  which may necessitate a positive or negative cumulative revenue adjustment 
as compared to contract revenue for increased by  or million  from included in revenue was million associated with our former collaboration agreement with genentech 
genentech and we agreed to terminate the agreement effective december  and  because there are no significant contractual obligations under the termination agreement between the parties  we recognized as revenue all amounts received and estimated to be due to us from genentech under the terms of the original agreement since the inception of the agreement on february  through the effective termination date 
excluding the genentech revenue  contract revenue in was million  which is a decrease from of million  or 
the decrease in contract revenue was primarily due to a lack of revenue related to the collaboration with dr 
falk in  compared to million of revenue recognized under that collaboration in we terminated the agreement with dr 
falk in the second quarter of partially offsetting the decrease caused by the lack of revenue from dr 
falk was an increase in net revenue associated with the cffti agreement of approximately million to million in  primarily due to the increase in development spending on trizytek in over as compared to contract revenue for decreased  or million  from the decrease reflects the combined unfavorable impact of million resulting from a negative revenue adjustment of million in the third quarter of due to an increase in our estimate of total development costs for trizytek coupled with a positive adjustment of million recognized in the third quarter of resulting from a reduction of our estimated development costs at that time 
offsetting the combination of these adjustments was additional revenue recorded in directly correlated to the increase in development spending on trizytek in 
table of contents research and development expense years ended december  increase decrease to to dollars in thousands trizytek altu altu stock based compensation other research and development total research and development as compared to research and development expense for increased primarily due to an increase in third party development costs and an increase in personnel and non cash compensation costs directly related to headcount increases during trizytek costs  which increased by over costs  primarily included a million associated with the conduct of our phase iii efficacy trial in cystic fibrosis patients  which commenced in may  and two phase iii long term safety studies  which commenced in june  b million associated with manufacturing trizytek phase iii clinical trial materials  and c million associated with establishing a reliable manufacturing process and supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredients api in our commercial drug supply  including helping lonza ltd  or lonza  establish its manufacturing facility and validating lonza s manufacturing process

altu costs in related primarily to a million of regulatory and other preparatory costs associated with our filing of an ind in june and the production of clinical trial materials  b million associated with the conduct of a phase i clinical trial  which commenced in august  and c million associated with development activities to improve the formulation and manufacturing process 
in addition  we continued to invest in our preclinical research and development programs at a slightly higher level than in  including proof of concept preclinical efficacy studies and product formulation work 
to support our increased level of activities  our research and development headcount increased to full time employees at december  from full time employees at december  product candidates in clinical development have greater associated development costs than those in the research or preclinical stage  and as product candidates move to later stage clinical trials  such as a phase iii clinical trial  the costs are higher due to the increased size and length of the clinical trial versus earlier stage clinical trials 
as a result  we anticipate that our research and development costs will continue to increase in coming periods as each of trizytek  altu and altu progresses through the clinical trial process and as our pre clinical product candidates advance in our pipeline 
further  in genentech provided  at no cost to us  the human growth hormone  or hgh  used in our development activities at althea in accordance with the collaboration agreement then in effect 
as a result of the termination of the genentech agreement  we will need to procure  at our own cost  adequate supplies of human growth hormone in and future years to further our development activities

the increase in personnel costs reflects the full year impact of headcount hired in in addition to new headcount hired in the increase in stock based compensation also relates to the increase in average headcount in over  plus an increase in the number of options granted 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the cost of legal services and a million decrease in market research and related costs 
during  we incurred significant outside legal costs related to negotiations of agreements with three contract manufacturing organizations  as well as substantial market research costs in connection with the initial preparations for our commercialization of trizytek  with correspondingly fewer costs in general  sales and administrative headcount was at december  compared to at december  the year over year increase in general  sales and administrative expense of in was considerably below the increase experienced in because  after an initial increase in costs to support our needs as a public company following our initial public offering in january  we have been successful in leveraging our core investments in personnel and our administrative and marketing infrastructure 
we expect this trend in general  sales and administrative expense will continue in as we continue to leverage our existing infrastructure and control administrative overhead costs 
as compared to general  sales and administrative expenses in increased from primarily due to the increased costs associated with building our administrative infrastructure to support the requirements of being a public company and an increase in marketing costs as we built our marketing infrastructure as our product candidates advanced through clinical trials 
as a result of completing our initial public offering in january  our legal costs  general insurance costs and consulting and professional service costs increased by million 
in addition  our stock based compensation expense for increased by million as we added personnel into the general  sales and administrative group and as we changed our assumptions used to value stock options under sfas r

as of december   we had received million from our collaborative agreement with cffti and are entitled to receive a million future milestone payment under the agreement if a development milestone is met  less an amount determined by when the milestone is achieved

the composition and mix of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may change frequently as a result of our evaluation of conditions in the financial markets  the maturity of specific investments  and our near term liquidity needs 
our funds at december  were invested in investment grade securities and money market funds 
since our inception  we have generated significant losses while we have advanced our product candidates into preclinical and clinical trials 
accordingly  we have historically used cash in our operating activities 
during the years ended december  and  our operating activities used million and million  respectively 
the use of cash in each period was primarily a result of expenditures associated with our research and development activities and amounts incurred to develop and maintain our administrative infrastructure  offset partially in by an aggregate of million received from genentech in conjunction with the terms of the original collaborative agreement for the upfront payment  cost reimbursements and the termination payment 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  due to capital expenditures of million and million of cash payments into certificates of deposits we were required to obtain to collateralize letters of credit relating to two year leases we entered into in october for facilities in waltham  massachusetts 
proceeds from the maturity and sale of marketable securities and purchases of marketable securities were both million in  thereby resulting in zero net cash flow 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  reflecting million used to purchase marketable securities  partially offset by proceeds from the maturity and sale of marketable securities of million and million for capital expenditures 
we expect capital expenditures to be between and million in in  our financing activities provided million  primarily reflecting net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock in april and the million equity investment by genentech

we have generally financed a substantial portion of our capital expenditures through equipment loans under which the lender retains a security interest in the equipment 
the equipment loans are governed by a master loan and security agreement that contains the key terms of the loans 
the master loan and security agreement require us to maintain insurance on the collateral 
each loan carries a fixed rate of interest which was established at the time of borrowing and is payable in fixed monthly installments over periods of up to four years 
we intend to secure additional equipment loans to continue to finance a substantial portion of our future capital expenditures

funding requirements we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities together with our expected cash inflow from collaborative agreements will be sufficient to fund our operations into mid however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
since our inception  we have generated significant losses while we have advanced our product candidates into preclinical and clinical trials 
as we continue to advance our product candidates through development and begin to incur increased sales and marketing costs related to commercialization of our product candidates  we expect to incur additional operating losses until such time  if any  as our efforts result in commercially viable drug products 
we do not expect our existing capital resources  together with the milestone payments and research and development funding we expect to receive  to be sufficient to fund the completion of the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates  and we expect that we will need to raise additional funds prior to being able to market any products 
we may also need additional funds for possible future strategic acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies complementary to our business 

table of contents our funding requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the continued development progress on trizytek  altu and altu  including the completion of nonclinical and clinical trials and the results of these studies  our ability to advance additional product candidates into clinical development from our preclinical portfolio  the timing  receipt and amount of milestone and other payments  if any  from present and future collaborations  the timing and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims for our drug discovery technology and product candidates and avoiding the infringement of intellectual property rights of others  the potential acquisition and in licensing of other technologies  products or assets  the timing  receipt and amount of sales and royalties  if any  from our product candidates  and the cost of manufacturing  marketing and sales activities  if any 
we do not expect to generate significant revenues  other than a milestone payment that we may receive from cffti or other similar collaborations we may enter into in the future  until we successfully obtain marketing approval for  and begin selling one or more of our product candidates 
we believe the key factors that will affect our internal and external sources of cash are our ability to successfully develop  manufacture and obtain regulatory approval for our clinical candidates  the success of clinical trials for trizytek  altu and altu  the success of our preclinical programs  our ability to enter into strategic collaborations with corporate collaborators and the success of such collaborations  and the receptivity of the capital markets to financings of biotechnology companies 
we may raise funds from time to time through public or private sales of equity or from borrowings 
financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely impact our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business 
for example  warrants issued in connection with our series b and series c financings contain anti dilution provisions that result in the issuance of additional shares of common stock upon exercise  and thus further dilution  to the extent we issue or are deemed to issue equity at a per share price that is less than the exercise price of the warrants 
at december    such warrants with an exercise price of per warrant and  such warrants with an exercise price of per warrant were outstanding 
we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements  other than operating leases

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are invested with highly rated financial institutions in north america with the primary objective of preservation of principal  while maintaining liquidity and generating favorable yields 
when purchased  investments have a maturity of less than months 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
to minimize the risk associated with changing interest rates  we invest primarily in bank certificates of deposit  united states government securities and investment grade commercial paper and corporate notes 
all of our investments at december  met these criteria 
at december   we had gross unrealized gains of approximately million on our investments 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
our total debt at december  was million  representing outstanding equipment loans 
all borrowings under our equipment loan agreements carry fixed rates of interest established at the time such borrowings were made 
accordingly  our future interest costs relating to such drawdowns are not subject to fluctuations in market interest rates 
our assets are principally located in the united states and a majority of our historical revenues and operating expenses are denominated in united states dollars 
our payments to dr 
falk for the repurchase of the european marketing rights of trizytek are denominated in euros  and the gross amount of that liability at december  is million 
in addition  some purchases of raw materials and contract manufacturing services are also denominated in foreign currencies

we recognized a foreign currency exchange loss of million in we had no foreign currency exchange gains or losses in we may engage in additional collaborations with international partners 
if trizytek or any other future drug candidates reach commercialization outside of the united states  or we enter into additional collaborations with international partners providing for foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses  we may be subject to significant foreign currency and market risk
