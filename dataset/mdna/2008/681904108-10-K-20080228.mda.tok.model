however  ebitda does not represent net cash flows from operating activities  as defined by us gaap  and should not be considered as a substitute for operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the company s calculation of ebitda may differ from the calculation of ebitda by others 
see five year summary of selected financial data for a reconciliation of ebitda to net cash flows from operating activities  at part ii  item of this filing

and negligible to moderate increases in variable costs eg  utilities  labor  etc  as well as the elimination of pharmacies through the company s productivity and consolidation initiatives  further discussed below 
the company believes it will be able to continue to leverage fixed and variable overhead costs through both internal and acquired growth 
government and other reimbursement formulas generally adjust to take into account drug price inflation or deflation 
in order to enhance its gross profit margins  the company strategically allocates its resources to those activities that will increase internal sales growth and favorably impact sales mix  or will lower costs 
in addition  through the ongoing development of its pharmaceutical purchasing programs  the company is able to obtain volume discounts and thereby manage its pharmaceutical costs

restructuring and other related charges omnicare full potential program in the second quarter of  the company commenced the implementation of the omnicare full potential plan  a major initiative primarily designed to re engineer the company s pharmacy operating model to increase efficiency and enhance customer growth 
the omnicare full potential plan is expected to optimize resources across the entire organization by implementing best practices  including the realignment and right sizing of functions  and a hub and spoke model whereby certain key support and production functions will be transferred to regional support centers hubs specifically designed and managed to perform these tasks  with local pharmacies spokes focusing on time sensitive services and customer facing processes 
this program is expected to be completed over a multi year period and is estimated to generate pretax savings in the range of million to million annually upon completion of the initiative 
it is anticipated that approximately one half of these savings will be realized in cost of sales  with the remainder being realized in operating expenses 
the program is estimated to result in total pretax restructuring and other related charges of approximately million over this implementation period

the company recorded restructuring and other related charges for the omnicare full potential plan of approximately million and million pretax approximately million and million aftertax during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the remainder of the overall restructuring charge will be recognized and disclosed prospectively as various phases of the project are finalized and implemented 
incremental capital expenditures related to this program are expected to total approximately million to million over the implementation period 
the company estimates that the initial phase of the program has led to a reduction in force of approximately  positions as of december   associated primarily with pharmacy operations 
while the company is working diligently to achieve the estimated savings as discussed above  there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of the program  including the related timing thereof  due to the inherent risks associated with the implementation of a project of this magnitude and the related new technologies 
specifically  the potential inability to successfully mitigate implementation risks  including but not necessarily limited to  dependence on third party suppliers and consultants for the timely delivery of technology as well as its performance at expected capacities  compliance with federal  state and local regulatory requirements  reliance on information technology and telecommunications support  timely completion of facility lease transactions and or leasehold improvements  and the ability to obtain adequate staffing levels  individually or in the aggregate could affect the overall success of the program from a savings and or timing standpoint

these consolidation and productivity initiatives were related  in part  to the integration of neighborcare 
given the geographic overlap of the neighborcare and omnicare pharmacies  substantial opportunities for consolidation existed at the time of acquisition 
while the majority of consolidations resulted in neighborcare pharmacies being consolidated into omnicare pharmacies  depending on location  capacity and operating performance  certain omnicare pharmacies were also identified for consolidation into neighborcare locations 
additionally  as part of the evaluation process on how best to integrate the two organizations  the company also focused broadly on ways to lower operating infrastructure costs to maximize efficiencies and asset utilization and identified opportunities to right size the business  streamline operations and eliminate redundant assets 
the consolidation activity and other productivity initiatives of the program resulted in the closure of omnicare facilities  of which were pharmacy operations 
additionally  there was a net reduction in force of approximately positions relating to the program 
of this reduction in force  approximately were in the pharmacy operations and the remaining reductions were at the corporate headquarters or the company s contract research operations 
restructuring activities in the contract research organization segment related primarily to facility lease obligations 
the company generated in excess of million in pretax savings from pharmacy closures and other consolidation and productivity initiatives implemented in connection with these activities 
the program initiatives required cumulative restructuring and other related charges of approximately million before taxes through the third quarter of  which related to the costs associated with the consolidation of omnicare pharmacies and the other consolidation and productivity initiatives described above 
specifically  the company recorded restructuring and other related charges of approximately million and million pretax during the years ended december  and  respectively approximately million and million aftertax  respectively 
the restructuring liabilities associated with the program were evaluated by the company during the year  at which time it was determined that certain liabilities were no longer expected to be utilized as part of the activities remaining under the program 
in accordance with sfas no

at december   omnicare served long term care facilities and other chronic care settings comprising approximately  beds as compared with approximately  beds served at december  contributing in large measure to the year over year increase in sales was the completion of several acquisitions in and  in particular  the acquisition of neighborcare completed in the third quarter of further  the acquisitions of excellerx and rxcrossroads in august and the completion of acquisitions in also contributed to the year over year sales increase 
in addition  pharmacy services sales increased due to a favorable payor mix shift offset in large measure by the aforementioned second quarter reduction in reimbursement rates under the united part d contract and drug price inflation 
the company estimates that drug price inflation for its highest dollar volume products in was approximately 
these positive factors were partially offset by a marked increase in the use of generic drugs  a lower number of beds served along with a bed mix shift  medicaid reimbursement reductions in late although the impact from medicaid reimbursement cuts now is much lower than seen historically due to the shift in payor mix largely from medicaid to medicare part d and competitive pricing pressures

although operating margins are generally unfavorably impacted by the initial addition of lower margin institutional pharmacy acquisitions  the integration efforts have historically resulted in drug purchasing improvements  the consolidation of redundant pharmacy locations and other economies of scale  which serve to leverage the company s operating cost structure and have historically resulted in improved operating margins in the long term as cost synergies are realized 
pharmacy services operating income in the year ended december  included an expected benefit of million attributable to the medication management performance provisions associated with a previously announced agreement with a third party under which omnicare provided certain services to a now completed disease management demonstration project

specifically  operating income of the pharmacy services segment in the year ended december   was impacted by special pretax charges of approximately million  including the aforementioned special litigation charges of million  a million charge associated with retention payments for certain neighborcare employees as required under the acquisition agreement and the previously mentioned restructuring and other related charges  of which approximately million was included in the pharmacy services segment and the previously mentioned million in charges related to the quality control  product recall and fire issues at heartland

the neighborcare acquisition provided opportunities to achieve economies of scale and cost synergies 
the company implemented an integration plan under which the processes have been put in place to achieve such savings in the purchasing of pharmaceuticals  the elimination of redundant functions and the consolidation of facilities in overlapping geographic territories 
cro services segment vs 
omnicare s cro services segment recorded revenues of million for the year ended december   which decreased by million  or from the million recorded in the same prior year period 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 the company included million and million of reimbursable out of pockets in its cro services segment reported revenue and direct cost amounts for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues for were lower than in the same prior year period primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in reimbursable out of pockets of million and the early termination and client driven delays in the commencement of certain projects during operating income in the cro services segment was million in compared with million in  an increase of million 
as a percentage of the segment s revenue  operating income was in compared with in this increase is primarily attributable to the cro services segment including pretax restructuring and other related charges of approximately million in while the year only included pretax restructuring and other related charges of approximately million 
operating income was unfavorably impacted by the reduction in revenues discussed above 
backlog at december  of million was million higher than the december  backlog of million 
impact of inflation as previously mentioned  the company estimates that drug price inflation for its highest dollar volume products in each of the three years ended december  approximated to  which tends to impact sales and costs of sales at approximately the same level 
therefore  inflation has not materially affected omnicare s net income  inasmuch as government and other reimbursement formulas generally adjust to take into account drug price inflation or deflation 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december  were million compared with million at december  including restricted cash amounts of million and million  respectively 
the company generated positive net cash flows from operating activities of million during the year ended december   compared with net cash flows from operating activities of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
partially contributing to net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december  were operating results during the period 
further  year over year cash flow was impacted by the favorable cash flow trend in accounts receivable and accounts payable on operating cash flows 
cash flow from operations for was impacted by cash payments of million related to the litigation matters and million related to the heartland matters 
see further discussion of these matters at the commitments and contingencies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this unfavorable impact was partially offset by the first quarter of return of a deposit of approximately million from one of the company s drug wholesalers 
cash flow from operations for also included the return of a million deposit from another of the company s drug wholesalers in connection with a change in terms to more frequent  weekly payments 
the impact of these more frequent payments on cash flow in slightly more than offset the million return of the deposit 
operating cash flows in were used primarily for acquisition related payments  debt payments  capital expenditures  dividend payments  and to increase the company s cash position as compared with december  net cash used by investing activities was million  million and billion in  and  respectively 
acquisitions of businesses required outlays of million including amounts payable pursuant to acquisition agreements relating to pre acquisitions in relating to acquisitions  which were primarily funded by operating cash flows 
acquisitions of businesses during and required cash payments of million and billion  respectively  including amounts payable pursuant to acquisition agreements relating to pre and pre acquisitions  respectively  which were primarily funded by proceeds from long term debt borrowings  proceeds from the issuance of common stock  invested cash and operating cash flows 
omnicare s capital requirements  in addition to the payment of debt and dividends  are primarily comprised of its acquisition program  as well as capital expenditures  largely relating to investments in the company s information technology systems and the implementation of the omnicare full potential plan 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  during  the company paid down million on the term loans 
borrowings on the revolving credit facility totaled approximately million during and were completely repaid prior to the end of the period 
during  the company paid down million on the term loans 
net cash provided by financing activities was billion for the year ended december  borrowings during were primarily related to the company entering into the new billion credit agreement credit agreement during the third quarter of  primarily to provide interim financing for the neighborcare  excellerx and rxcrossroads transactions 
the credit agreement consisted of a billion day loan facility  a five year million revolving credit facility due and a five year million senior term a loan facility due proceeds from the credit agreement were also utilized to retire the company s old revolving credit facility and old term a loan  resulting in net payments on these two borrowings of million during the year ended december  on december   the company completed a major refinancing undertaken primarily to provide long term financing for the neighborcare  excellerx and rxcrossroads transactions 
total gross proceeds from the refinancing were approximately billion from the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes due  million of senior subordinated notes due  million of convertible senior debentures due  and million of omnicare common stock excluding gross proceeds of approximately million received in january from the underwriters of the common stock offering exercising their option in part to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at per share 
the net proceeds from the refinancing were primarily utilized to pay off the interim financing provided by the billion day loan facility and the purchase of approximately million of the company s senior subordinated notes due pursuant to a tender offer and consent solicitation 
see further discussion of the company s financing activities at the debt note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings on the million revolving credit facility  and million in borrowings were outstanding on the term loans 
as of december   the company had approximately million outstanding relating to standby letters of credit  substantially all of which are subject to automatic annual renewals 
on february   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of cents per share for an indicated annual rate of cents per common share for  which is consistent with annual dividends paid per common share for the  and years 
aggregate dividends of million paid during were consistent with the million paid in  and modestly higher than the million paid in  due to the late and early common stock offering  as further discussed at the public offering of common stock note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there were no known material commitments and contingencies outstanding at december   other than the contractual obligations summarized in the disclosures about aggregate contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements caption below  certain acquisition related payments potentially due in the future  including deferred payments  indemnification payments and payments originating from earnout and other provisions that may become payable  as well as the matters discussed in the commitments and contingencies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and the legal proceedings section at part i  item of this filing 
the company believes that net cash flows from operating activities  credit facilities and other short and long term debt financings will be sufficient to satisfy its future working capital needs  acquisition contingency commitments  debt servicing  capital expenditures and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company believes that external sources of financing are readily available and will access them as deemed appropriate although no assurances can be given regarding the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future on acceptable terms and conditions 
disclosures about aggregate contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements aggregate contractual obligations the following summarizes the company s aggregate contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands total less than year years years after years debt obligations a capital lease obligations a operating lease obligations purchase obligations b other current obligations c other long term obligations d subtotal future interest relating to debt and capital lease obligations e total contractual cash obligations a the noted obligation amounts represent the principal portion of the associated debt obligations 
details of the company s outstanding debt instruments can be found in the debt note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
b purchase obligations primarily consist of open inventory purchase orders  as well as obligations for other goods and services  at period end 
c other current obligations primarily consist of accounts payable at period end 
d other long term obligations are largely comprised of pension and excess benefit plan obligations  acquisition related liabilities  the obligation associated with the interest rate swap agreement discussed below  as well as accruals relating to uncertain tax positions 
e represents estimated future pretax interest costs based on the stated fixed interest rate of the debt  or the variable interest rate in effect at period end for variable interest rate debt 
the estimated future interest costs presented in this table do not include any amounts potentially payable associated with the contingent interest and interest reset provisions of the company s convertible debentures 
to the extent that any debt would be paid off by omnicare prior to the stated due date or refinanced  the estimated future interest costs would change accordingly 
further  these analyses do not consider the effects of potential changes  if any  in the company s credit rating 
as of december   the company had approximately million outstanding relating to standby letters of credit  substantially all of which are subject to automatic annual renewals 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company had two unconsolidated entities  omnicare capital trust i  a statutory trust formed by the company the old trust and omnicare capital trust ii the new trust  which were established for the purpose of facilitating the offerings of the trust preferred income equity redeemable securities due the old trust piers and the series b trust preferred income equity redeemable securities the new trust piers  respectively 
for financial reporting purposes  the old trust and new trust are treated as equity method investments of the company 
the old trust and new trust are owned finance subsidiaries of the company 
the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the securities of the old trust and new trust 
the old debentures issued by the company to the old trust and the new debentures issued by the company to the new trust in connection with the issuance of the old trust piers and the new trust piers  respectively  are presented as a single line item in omnicare s consolidated balance sheets and debt footnote disclosures 
additionally  the related disclosures concerning the old trust piers and the new trust piers  the guarantees  and the old debentures and new debentures are included in the debt note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
omnicare records interest payable to the old trust and new trust as interest expense in its consolidated statement of income 
as of december   the company had no other unconsolidated entities  or any financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk omnicare s primary market risk exposure relates to variable interest rate risk through its borrowings 
accordingly  market risk loss is primarily defined as the potential loss in earnings due to higher interest rates on variable rate debt of the company 
the modeling technique used by omnicare for evaluating interest rate risk exposure involves performing sensitivity analysis on the variable rate debt  assuming a change in interest rates of basis points 
the company s debt obligations at december  include million outstanding under the variable rate senior term a loan  due  at an interest rate of at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pretax interest expense by approximately million per year  million borrowed on a variable rate term loan  due  at an interest rate of at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pretax interest expense by approximately million per year  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  million outstanding under its fixed rate senior notes  due  million outstanding under its fixed rate convertible debentures  due  and million outstanding under its fixed rate convertible debentures  due with an optional repurchase right of holders on december  
in connection with its offering of million of senior notes  during the second quarter of  the company entered into a swap agreement on all million of its aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 
under the swap agreement  which hedges against exposure to long term us dollar interest rates  the company receives a fixed rate of and pays a floating rate based on libor with a maturity of six months  plus a spread of 
the estimated libor based floating rate including the spread was at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease pretax interest expense by approximately million per year 
the swap agreement  which matches the terms of the senior notes  is designated and accounted for as a fair value hedge 
the company is accounting for the swap agreement in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended  so changes in the fair value of the swap agreement are offset by changes in the recorded carrying value of the related senior notes 
the fair value of the swap agreement of approximately million at december   based on an estimate obtained from an outside advisor  is recorded as a noncurrent liability and a reduction to the book carrying value of the related senior notes 
at december   the fair value of omnicare s variable rate debt facilities approximates the carrying value  as the effective interest rates fluctuate with changes in market rates 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt facilities is based on quoted market prices and is summarized as follows in thousands fair value of financial instruments december  financial instrument book value market value book value market value senior subordinated notes  due  gross senior subordinated notes  due senior subordinated notes  due junior subordinated convertible debentures  due convertible senior debentures  due embedded in the old trust piers  the new trust piers and the convertible debentures are two derivative instruments  specifically  a contingent interest provision and a contingent conversion parity provision 
in addition  the convertible debentures include an interest reset provision 
the embedded derivatives are periodically valued by a third party advisor  and at period end  the values of the derivatives embedded in the old trust piers  the new trust piers and the convertible debentures were not material 
however  the values are subject to change  based on market conditions  which could affect the company s future consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company has operations and revenue that occur outside of the us and transactions that are settled in currencies other than the us dollar  exposing it to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  the substantial portion of the company s operations and revenues and the substantial portion of the company s cash settlements are exchanged in us dollars 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates do not represent a substantial market risk exposure to the company 
the company does not have any financial instruments held for trading purposes 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  omnicare management is required to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates the estimates used  including those related to its provision for doubtful accounts  contractual allowances  inventory valuation  impairment of goodwill  insurance accruals  pension obligations  income taxes  stock based compensation  legal and regulatory contingencies  and other operating allowances and accruals 
management bases its estimates on a combination of factors  including historical experience  current conditions  feedback from outside advisors where feasible  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time and under the current circumstances 
the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in the description of business and summary of significant accounting policies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require significant management judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the determination of the registrant s financial position and operating results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
omnicare s critical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions require revision 
application of the critical accounting policies requires management s significant judgments  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently and highly uncertain  including those matters further discussed below 
if actual results were to differ materially from the judgments and estimates made  the company s reported financial position and or operating results could be materially affected 
omnicare management continually reviews these estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition omnicare recognizes revenue when products or services are delivered or provided to the customer 
pharmacy services segment a significant portion of the company s pharmacy services segment revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products have been reimbursed by the federal medicare part d plan and  to a lesser extent  state medicaid programs 
payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
the company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources  as well as other third party insurance payors  and records an estimated contractual allowance for certain sales and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date  to properly account for anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts 
accordingly  the total net sales and receivables reported in the company s financial statements are recorded at the amount ultimately expected to be received from these payors 
since billing functions for a portion of the company s revenue systems are largely computerized  enabling on line adjudication ie  submitting charges to medicare  medicaid or other third party payors electronically  with simultaneous feedback of the amount to be paid at the time of sale to record net revenues  exposure to estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and or initially rejected medicare  medicaid and third party claims oftentimes approved for reimbursement once additional information is provided to the payor 
for the remaining portion of the company s revenue systems  the contractual allowance is estimated for all billed  unbilled and or initially rejected medicare  medicaid and third party claims 
the company evaluates several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances for billed  unbilled and or initially rejected claims on a monthly basis  including historical trends based on actual claims paid  current contract and reimbursement terms  and changes in customer base and payor product mix 
contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled  and the aggregate impact of these resulting adjustments were not significant to the company s operations for any of the periods presented 
further  omnicare does not expect the reasonably possible effects of a change in estimate related to unsettled december  contractual allowance amounts from medicare  medicaid and third party payors to be significant to its future consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
patient co payments are associated with medicare part d see further discussion below  certain state medicaid programs  medicare part b and certain third party payors and are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered  but are billed to the individual as part of the company s normal billing procedures 
these co payments are subject to the company s normal accounts receivable collections procedures 
a patient may be dispensed prescribed medications typically no more than a day supply prior to insurance being verified in emergency situations  or for new facility admissions after hours or on weekends 
as soon as practicable typically the following business day  specific payor information is obtained so that the proper payor can be billed for reimbursement 
under certain circumstances  the company accepts returns of medications and issues a credit memo to the applicable payor 
the company estimates and accrues for sales returns based on historical return experience  giving consideration to the company s return policies 
product returns are processed in the period received and are not significant when compared to the overall sales and gross profit of the company 
contract research services segment a portion of the company s overall revenues relates to the contract research services cro segment  and is earned by performing services under contracts with various pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device and diagnostics companies  based on contract terms 
most of the contracts provide for services to be performed on a units of service basis 
these contracts specifically identify the units of service and unit pricing 
under these contracts  revenue is generally recognized upon completion of the units of service 
for time and materials contracts  revenue is recognized at contractual hourly rates  and for fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using a method similar to that used for units of service 
the company s contracts provide for additional service fees for scope of work changes 
the company recognizes revenue related to these scope changes when underlying services are performed and realization is assured 
in a number of cases  clients are required to make termination payments in addition to payments for services already rendered 
any anticipated losses resulting from contract performance are charged to earnings in the period identified 
billings and payments are specified in each contract 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is classified as unbilled receivables  while billings in excess of revenue are classified as deferred revenue  on the respective lines of the consolidated balance sheets 
allowance for doubtful accounts collection of accounts receivable from customers is the company s primary source of operating cash flow and is critical to omnicare s operating performance  cash flows and financial condition 
omnicare s primary collection risk relates to facility  private pay and part d customers 
the company provides a reserve for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
omnicare establishes this allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification approach  and considering such factors as historical collection experience ie  payment history and credit losses and creditworthiness  specifically identified credit risks  aging of accounts receivable by payor category  current and expected economic conditions and other relevant factors 
management reviews this allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis for appropriateness 
judgment is used to assess the collectibility of account balances and the economic ability of customers to pay 
the company computes and monitors its accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso  a non gaap measure  in order to evaluate the liquidity and collection patterns of its accounts receivable 
dso is calculated by averaging the beginning and end of quarter accounts receivable  less contractual allowances and the allowance for doubtful accounts  to derive average accounts receivable  and dividing average accounts receivable by the sales amount excluding reimbursable out of pockets for the related quarter 
the resultant percentage is multiplied by days to derive the dso amount 
omnicare s dso approximated days at december   which was lower than the december  dso of approximately days 
as previously disclosed  the company has experienced on going administrative and payment issues associated with the medicare part d implementation  resulting in outstanding gross accounts receivables net of allowances for contractual adjustments  and prior to any allowance for doubtful accounts for copays and rejected claims 
as of december   copays outstanding from part d plans were approximately million  of which approximately million relates to additionally  as of december   part d rejected claims outstanding from part d plans for the transitional year were approximately million 
unfavorably impacting the overall dso  as well as the increase in the days and over past due accounts receivable balance  is the aging in accounts receivable relating to several of the company s larger nursing home chain customers 
on july   the company commenced legal action against a group of its customers for  among other things  the collection of past due receivables that are owed to the company 
specifically  approximately million excluding interest and prior to any allowance for doubtful accounts is owed to the company by this group of customers as of december   of which approximately million is past due based on applicable payment terms a significant portion of which is not reserved 
the million represents approximately five days of the overall dso at december  until all administrative and payment issues relating to the part d drug benefit as well as the aforementioned legal action against a group of omnicare s customers are fully resolved  there can be no assurance that the impact of these matters on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows will not change based on the outcome of any unforeseen future developments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million  compared with million at december  these allowances for doubtful accounts represented and of gross receivables net of contractual allowances as of december  and  respectively 
unforeseen future developments could lead to changes in the company s provision for doubtful accounts levels and future allowance for doubtful accounts percentages  which could materially impact the overall consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows of the company 
for example  a one percentage point increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross receivables net of allowances for contractual adjustments  and prior to allowances for doubtful accounts as of december  would result in an increase to the provision for doubtful accounts and related allowance for doubtful accounts on the balance sheet of approximately million pretax 
the following table is an aging of the company s december  and gross accounts receivable net of allowances for contractual adjustments  and prior to allowances for doubtful accounts  aged based on payment terms and categorized based on the four primary overall types of accounts receivable characteristics in thousands december  current and days past due days and over past due total medicare part d and part b  medicaid and third party payors facility payors private pay payors cro total gross accounts receivable net of contractual allowance adjustments december  current and days past due days and over past due total medicare part d and part b  medicaid and third party payors facility payors private pay payors cro total gross accounts receivable net of contractual allowance adjustments patient charges pending approval from medicare  medicaid and third party payors are primarily billed as private pay and  where applicable  are recorded net of an estimated contractual allowance at period end 
once an approval to bill medicare  medicaid and or third party payors has been obtained  the private pay balance is reversed and a corresponding medicare  medicaid or third party receivable amount is recorded 
the company s policy is to resolve accounts receivable with pending status as soon as practicable 
pending accounts receivable balances were not a significant component of the overall accounts receivable balance at december  omnicare has standard policies and procedures for collection of its accounts receivable 
the company s collection efforts generally include the mailing of statements  followed up when necessary with delinquency notices  personal and other contacts  the use of an in house national collections department or outside collection agencies  and potentially mediation arbitration or litigation when accounts are considered unresponsive 
omnicare s collection efforts primarily relate to its facility and private pay customers  as well as efforts to collect rework medicare part d copays and rejected claims 
when omnicare becomes aware that a specific customer is potentially unable to meet part or all of its financial obligations  for example  as a result of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  the national credit and collections department includes the exposed balance in its allowance for doubtful accounts requirements 
at such time that a balance is definitively deemed to be uncollectible by omnicare management including the national credit and collections department  collections agencies and or outside legal counsel  the balance is manually written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   except for the accounts receivable matters separately disclosed in this filing  the company does not have a significant portion of its overall accounts receivable balance placed in mediation arbitration  litigation or with outside collection agencies 
given the company s experience  management believes that the aggregate reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if any of the company s larger customers were to unexpectedly default on their obligations to omnicare  the company s overall allowances for doubtful accounts may prove to be inadequate 
in particular  if economic conditions worsen  the payor mix shifts significantly  additional part d payment issues arise  or the company s customers reimbursement rates are adversely affected  impacting omnicare s customers ability to pay their bills  management may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly  and the company s accounts receivable collections  cash flows  financial position and results of operations would then be  potentially  adversely affected 
inventories the company maintains inventory at lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the basis of the first in  first out method 
there are not any significant obsolescence reserves recorded since the company has not historically experienced nor does it expect to experience significant levels of inventory obsolescence write offs 
physical inventories are typically performed on a monthly basis at all pharmacy sites  and in all cases the company s policy is to perform them at least once a quarter 
cost of goods sold is recorded based on the actual results of the physical inventory counts  and is estimated when a physical inventory is not performed in a particular month 
goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be reviewed for impairment using a fair value based approach at least annually 
sfas requires the company to assess whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired  and requires goodwill to be tested between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its book carrying amount 
the company s assessments to date have indicated that goodwill has not been impaired 
the company s assessment of goodwill impairment is largely dependent on estimates of future cash flows at the aggregated reporting unit level  and a weighted average cost of capital 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections with respect to future revenues and expenses believed to be reasonable and supportable at the time the annual impairment analysis is performed 
further  they require management s subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about overall growth rates and increases in expenses 
to the extent the book carrying value of the assets would exceed their fair value  an impairment loss may be necessary 
changes in the estimates of future cash flows or weighted average cost of capital due to unforeseen events and circumstances could cause omnicare s analysis to indicate that goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods  and could result in the write off of a portion or all of the company s goodwill  which could be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
insurance accruals omnicare is self insured for certain employee health insurance claims 
the company manages its health insurance risk by obtaining individual and aggregate stop loss coverage in the amount of  per claim and of expected aggregate claims  or approximately million for the year 
additionally  omnicare insures all of its property and casualty programs including worker s compensation and professional liability in excess of self insured retentions  or deductibles  on the various policies of insurance which range from between  and  per claim  depending on the type of coverage 
omnicare closely monitors and continually evaluates its historical claims experience  and obtains input from third party insurance and valuation professionals  to estimate the appropriate level of accrual for its self insured programs  including the aforementioned deductibles 
these accruals include provision for incurred  as well as incurred but not yet reported  claims 
in developing its self insurance accrual estimates  the company s liability calculation also considers the historical claim lag periods and current payment trends of insurance claims generally approximately months for health  and months for all other coverages 
a change in the historical claim lag period assumption by one month for health insurance claims would affect health insurance expense by approximately million pretax 
a change in the historical claim lag period by one month for property and casualty insurance claims would affect property and casualty insurance expense by approximately million pretax 
although significant fluctuations may occur in the short term due to unforeseen events potentially resulting in atypical claims experience  the company s historical claims experience  coupled with its stop loss coverages  has consistently supported management s assumption that this methodology provides for reasonable insurance expense estimates and accruals over a long term period 
employee benefit plans for certain of its employee benefit plans  the company utilizes estimates in developing its actuarial assumptions including such items as the expected rate of return on plan assets  discount rate  mortality rates  and the assumed rate of compensation increase  among other items  and relies on actuarial computations to estimate the future potential liability  expense and funding requirements associated with these benefits 
while it is required that the actuarial assumptions be reviewed each year as of the measurement date of december  the actuarial assumptions generally do not change between measurement dates 
during omnicare s annual review  generally near the beginning of the fiscal year  the company reviews and updates these assumptions  and considers historical experience  current market conditions and input from its third party advisors  including any changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
these actuarial assumptions and estimates attempt to anticipate future events  and if assessed differently  or if they materially vary from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  a one percentage point change in any of the individual aforementioned assumptions used to calculate the company s pension obligation  holding all other assumptions constant  is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated operating results 
taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas  the company estimates its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  including those relating to acquired subsidiaries  based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as the realization of deferred tax assets including those relating to net operating losses 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
omnicare periodically reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on the company s expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and omnicare s tax methods of accounting 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income by jurisdiction  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  then the company could be required to increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate and related tax expense 
the company also reviews its tax liabilities  including those relating to acquired subsidiaries  giving consideration to the relevant authoritative guidance  including sfas and fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin provides guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  recognition and measurement are considered discrete events 
the recognition threshold is met when it is determined a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 
omnicare operates in a significant number of states and tax jurisdictions with varying tax laws 
the company is subject to both federal and state audits of tax returns in the normal course of business 
while the company believes it has provided adequately for tax liabilities in its consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by applicable taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on omnicare s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  the company could potentially experience tax losses 
likewise  if provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  the company could experience potential tax gains 
a one percentage point change in the company s overall  and effective tax rates would impact tax expense and net income by million  million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas r  which replaced sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for stock incentive plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb  and related interpretations intrinsic value method 
historically  stock option awards have been granted with an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of company stock upon grant 
as a result  no stock based employee compensation cost for stock options was reflected in net income 
as further described in the recently issued accounting standards section of the description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  and stock based employee compensation  notes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  sfas r requires the company to record compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions in its financial statements 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award usually the vesting period 
the company uses the black scholes options pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date  which is affected by omnicare s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  as further discussed below 
these variables include omnicare s expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate and the stock s dividend yield 
the expected term of stock options granted represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding and is estimated giving consideration primarily to historical stock option exercise experience 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock over a period generally commensurate with the expected term of the stock options 
the risk free interest rate used in the option valuation model is based on united states treasury strip stripped coupon interest issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the stock options 
the expected dividend yield is based on the current omnicare stock yield 
the company is required to estimate forfeitures at the time of the grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods as necessary to reflect any changes in actual forfeiture experience 
omnicare uses historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock option awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting period 
considering the importance of each of the above assumptions in the calculation of fair value  the company re evaluates the estimate of these assumptions on a quarterly basis 
while the company believes its stock option fair value calculations are materially accurate  a one percentage point change in any of the individual aforementioned assumptions  holding all other assumptions constant  is not expected to have a material impact on the fair value calculated by the company 
legal contingencies as part of its ongoing operations  the company is subject to various inspections  audits  inquiries and similar actions by third parties  as well as governmental regulatory authorities responsible for enforcing the laws and regulations to which the company is subject and including reviews of individual omnicare pharmacy s reimbursement documentation and administrative practices 
oftentimes  these inspections  audits and inquiries relate to prior periods  including periods predating omnicare s actual ownership of a particular acquired unit 
the company is also involved with various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company reviews  including consultation with its outside legal advisors where applicable  the status of inspections  audits  inquiries  legal claims and legal proceedings and assesses its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any of these is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss  in accordance with sfas to the extent the amount of a probable loss is estimable only by reference to a range of equally probable outcomes  and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  the low end of the range is accrued  as required by gaap 
because of inherent uncertainties related to these matters  the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and external factors beyond the company s control  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  omnicare reassesses the potential liability related to any pending inspections  audits  inquiries  claims and litigation and may revise its estimated exposure upward or downward accordingly 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
information pertaining to legal proceedings is further discussed at the commitments and contingencies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards information pertaining to recently issued accounting standards is further discussed at the recently issued accounting standards section of the description of business and summary of significant accounting policies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
outlook historically  the company has derived approximately one half of its revenues directly from government sources and one half from the private sector including individual residents  third party insurers  long term care and other institutional health care facilities and its contract research organization business 
as part of ongoing operations  the company and its customers are subject to regulatory changes in the level of reimbursement received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
since  congress has passed a number of federal laws that have effected major changes in the healthcare system and payments to certain providers 
the balanced budget act of the bba mandated a prospective payment system pps for medicare eligible residents of skilled nursing facilities snfs 
under pps  medicare pays snfs a fixed fee per patient per day based upon the acuity level of the resident  covering substantially all items and services furnished during a medicare covered stay  including pharmacy services 
pps initially resulted in a significant reduction of reimbursement to snfs 
congress subsequently sought to restore some of the reductions in reimbursement resulting from pps 
one provision gave snfs a temporary rate increase for certain specific high acuity patients beginning april   and ending when the centers for medicare medicaid services cms implemented a refined patient classification system under pps 
for several years  cms did not implement such refinements  thus continuing the additional rate increase for certain high acuity patients through federal fiscal year on august   cms issued its final snf pps rule for fiscal year under the rule  cms added nine patient classification categories to the pps patient classification system  thus triggering the expiration of the high acuity payments add ons 
however  cms estimated that the rule would have a slightly positive financial impact on snfs in fiscal year because the billion reduction from the expiration of the add on payments would be more than offset by a million increase in the nursing case mix weight for all of the resource utilization group categories and a million increase associated with various updates to the payment rates including updates to the wage and market basket indexes  resulting in a million overall increase in payments for fiscal year the new patient classification refinements became effective on january   and the market basket increase became effective october  on july   cms issued the update to the snf pps rates for fiscal year effective october   snfs receive the full percent market basket increase to rates  increasing payments to snfs by approximately million for fiscal year on august   cms published its final snf pps update for fiscal year effective october   snfs receive a percent market basket increase  which increases medicare payments to snfs by approximately million in fiscal year the final rule also includes several policy and payment provisions  including rebasing the market basket  which currently reflects data from fiscal  to a base year of fiscal year  revisions to the calculation of the snf market basket including revising the pharmacy component  changing the threshold for forecast error adjustments from the current percentage point to percentage point  and continuing a special adjustment made to cover the additional services required by nursing home residents with hiv aids 
while the fiscal year and snf pps rates do not decrease payments to snfs  the loss of revenues associated with future changes in snf payments could  in the future  have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the company s snf clients which could  in turn  adversely affect the timing or level of their payments to omnicare 
moreover  on february   the president signed into law the deficit reduction act dra  which will reduce net medicare and medicaid spending by approximately billion over five years 
among other things  the legislation reduces medicare snf bad debt payments by percent for those individuals who are not dually eligible for medicare and medicaid 
this provision is expected to reduce payments to snfs by million over five years fiscal years 
on february   the bush administration released its fiscal year budget proposal  which includes legislative and administrative proposals that would reduce medicare spending by approximately billion in fiscal year and billion over five years 
among other things  the budget would provide no annual update for snfs in through and a percent adjustment to the update annually thereafter 
in addition  the budget would apply a sequester of percent to all medicare provider payments when general fund contributions exceed percent of program spending 
the sequester order would increase each year by percent until general revenue funding is brought back to percent 
the budget also would move toward site neutral post hospital payments to limit perceived inappropriate incentives for five conditions commonly treated in both snfs and inpatient rehabilitation facilities 
the administration also proposes to achieve savings by issuing regulations to adjust for case mix distribution in the snf payment system 
in addition  the budget proposal would eliminate all bad debt reimbursements for unpaid beneficiary cost sharing over four years 
many provisions of the proposed bush budget would require congressional action to implement 
in addition  on august   the house of representatives approved hr  the children s health and medicare protection act of  that included a number of medicare policy changes  including a freeze in fiscal year snf pps rates at fiscal year levels 
note that while the version of the bill that ultimately passed congress did not include medicare provisions impacting snf reimbursement  congress may yet consider these and other proposals in the future that would further restrict medicare funding for snfs 
in december  congress enacted the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of mma  which included a major expansion of the medicare prescription drug benefit under a new medicare part d 
under the medicare part d prescription drug benefit  medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities or in a fallback plan offered on behalf of the government through a contractor  to the extent private entities fail to offer a plan in a given area  which provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs collectively  part d plans 
part d plans include both plans providing the drug benefit on a stand alone basis and medicare advantage plans providing drug coverage as a supplement to an existing medical benefit under that medicare advantage plan  most commonly a health maintenance organization plan 
medicare beneficiaries generally have to pay a premium to enroll in a part d plan  with the premium amount varying from plan to plan  although cms provides various federal subsidies to part d plans to reduce the cost to beneficiaries 
effective january   medicare beneficiaries who are also entitled to benefits under a state medicaid program so called dual eligibles now have their prescription drug costs covered by the new medicare drug benefit 
many nursing home residents omnicare serves are dual eligibles  whose drug costs were previously covered by state medicaid programs 
in  approximately of omnicare s revenue was derived from beneficiaries covered under the federal medicare part d program 
cms provides premium and cost sharing subsidies to part d plans with respect to dual eligible residents of nursing homes 
such dual eligibles are not required to pay a premium for enrollment in a part d plan  so long as the premium for the part d plan in which they are enrolled is at or below the premium subsidy  nor are they required to meet deductibles or pay copayment amounts 
further  all dual eligibles who do not affirmatively enroll in a part d plan are automatically enrolled into a prescription drug plan pdp by cms on a random basis from among those pdps meeting cms criteria for low income premiums in the pdp region 
as is the case for any nursing home beneficiary  such dual eligible beneficiaries may select a different part d plan at any time through the part d enrollment process 
in sum  dual eligible residents of nursing homes are entitled to have their prescription drug costs covered by a part d plan  provided that the prescription drugs which they are taking are either on the part d plan s formulary  or an exception to the plan s formulary is granted 
cms requires the formularies of part d plans to include the types of drugs most commonly needed by medicare beneficiaries and to offer an exceptions process to provide coverage for medically necessary drugs 
pursuant to the final part d rule  effective january   the company obtains reimbursement for drugs it provides to enrollees of a given part d plan in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated between it and that part d plan 
the company has entered into such agreements with nearly all part d plan sponsors under which it will provide drugs and associated services to their enrollees 
the company continues to have ongoing discussions with part d plans in the ordinary course 
moreover  the company may as appropriate  renegotiate agreements 
further  the proportion of the company s part d business serviced under specific agreements may change over time 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the reimbursement terms which currently apply to the company s part d business will not change 
moreover  as expected in the transition to a new program of this magnitude  certain administrative and payment issues have arisen  resulting in higher operating expenses  as well as outstanding gross accounts receivable net of allowances for contractual adjustments  and prior to any allowance for doubtful accounts for copays and rejected claims 
as of december   copays outstanding from part d plans were approximately million  of which approximately million relates to additionally  as of december   part d rejected claims outstanding from part d plans for the transitional year were approximately million 
participants in the long term care pharmacy industry continue to address these issues with cms and the part d plans and attempt to develop solutions 
the company is also pursuing legal actions against certain part d payors to collect outstanding copays 
however  until all administrative and payment issues are fully resolved  there can be no assurance that the impact of the part d drug benefit on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows will not change based on the outcome of any unforeseen future developments 
the mma does not change the manner in which medicare pays for drugs for medicare beneficiaries covered under a medicare part a stay 
the company continues to receive reimbursement for drugs provided to such residents from the snfs  in accordance with the terms of the agreements it has negotiated with each snf 
the company also continues to receive reimbursement from the state medicaid programs  albeit to a greatly reduced extent  for those medicaid beneficiaries not eligible for the part d program  including those under age  and for certain drugs specifically excluded from medicare part d 
cms has issued subregulatory guidance on many aspects of the final part d rule  including the provision of pharmaceutical services to long term care residents 
cms has also expressed some concerns about pharmacies receipt of discounts  rebates and other price concessions from drug manufacturers 
specifically  in a finalized call letter for the calendar year  cms indicated that  beginning in  part d sponsors must have policies and systems in place  as part of their drug utilization management programs  to protect beneficiaries and reduce costs when long term care pharmacies are subject to incentives to move market share through access performance rebates from drug manufacturers 
for the purposes of managing and monitoring drug utilization  especially where such rebates exist  cms instructs part d plan sponsors to require pharmacies to disclose to the part d plan sponsor any discounts  rebates and other direct or indirect remuneration designed to directly or indirectly influence or impact utilization of part d drugs 
cms stated that plan sponsors should provide assurances that such information will remain confidential 
cms has issued subregulatory guidelines specifying the information that cms is requiring from plan sponsors with respect to rebates paid to long term care pharmacies 
cms has also issued reporting requirements for which  among other things  require disclosure of rebates provided to long term care pharmacies at a more detailed level 
the company has agreed with various plan sponsors and their agents with respect to the format  terms and conditions for providing such information and the company intends to continue to work with other sponsors with respect to providing such information 
cms continues to issue guidance on and make revisions to the part d program 
the company is continuing to monitor issues relating to implementation of the part d benefit  and until further agency guidance is known and until all administrative and payment issues associated with the transition to this massive program are fully resolved  there can be no assurance that the impact of the final rule or the outcome of other potential developments relating to its implementation on our business  results of operations  financial position or cash flows will not change based on the outcome of any unforeseen future developments 
the mma also changed the medicare payment methodology and conditions for coverage of certain items of durable medical equipment prosthetics  orthotics  and supplies dmepos under medicare part b 
approximately of the company s revenue is derived from beneficiaries covered under medicare part b 
the changes include a temporary freeze in annual increases in payments for durable medical equipment from through  new clinical conditions for payment  quality standards applied by cms approved accrediting organizations  and competitive bidding requirements 
on april   cms issued a final rule establishing the medicare competitive bidding program 
only suppliers that are winning bidders will be eligible to provide competitively bid items to medicare beneficiaries in the selected areas 
enteral nutrients  equipment and supplies and oxygen equipment and supplies are among the categories of dmepos included in the first round of the competitive bidding program for geographic areas beginning july  a delay from the previously announced implementation date of april  
the company has submitted bids for nine competitive bidding areas 
awards are expected to be announced in february in addition  in january  cms announced the locations in which the second round of competitive bidding will be conducted later in the expanded program will apply to eight product categories  again including oxygen supplies and equipment and enteral nutrients  equipment and supplies 
bid prices will take effect sometime in cms also has announced that all existing dmepos suppliers will need to submit proof of accreditation by a deemed accreditation organization by september   although suppliers in the competitive bidding regions and new suppliers are subject to earlier accreditation deadlines 
the company intends to comply with all accreditation requirements for dmepos suppliers by the applicable deadline 
with respect to medicaid  the bba repealed the boren amendment federal payment standard for medicaid payments to nursing facilities  giving states greater latitude in setting payment rates for such facilities 
the law also granted states greater flexibility to establish medicaid managed care programs without the need to obtain a federal waiver 
although these waiver programs generally exempt institutional care  including nursing facilities and institutional pharmacy services  some states do use managed care principles in their long term care programs 
likewise  the dra includes several changes to the medicaid program designed to rein in program spending 
these include  among others  strengthening the medicaid asset transfer restrictions for persons seeking to qualify for medicaid long term care coverage  which could  due to the timing of the penalty period  increase facilities exposure to uncompensated care 
this provision is expected to reduce medicaid spending by an estimated billion over five years 
the law also gives states greater flexibility to expand access to home and community based services by allowing states to provide these services as an optional benefit without undergoing the waiver approval process  and includes a new demonstration to encourage states to provide long term care services in a community setting to individuals who currently receive medicaid services in nursing homes 
together  these provisions could increase state funding for home and community based services  while prompting states to cut funding for nursing facilities 
no assurances can be given that state medicaid programs ultimately will not change the reimbursement system for long term care or pharmacy services 
the dra also changed the so called federal upper limit payment rules for multiple source prescription drugs covered under medicaid 
like the current upper limit  it only applies to drug ingredient costs and does not include dispensing fees  which will continue to be determined by the states 
first  the dra redefined a multiple source drug subject to the upper limit rules to be a covered outpatient drug that has at least one other drug product that is therapeutically equivalent 
thus  the federal upper limit is triggered when there are two or more therapeutic equivalents  instead of three or more as was previously the case 
second  effective january   the dra changed the federal upper payment limit from percent of the lowest published price for a drug which is usually the average wholesale price to percent of the lowest average manufacturer price amp 
congress expected these dra provisions to reduce federal and state medicaid spending by billion over five years 
on july   cms issued a final rule with comment period to implement changes to the upper limit rules 
among other things  the final rule establishes a new federal upper limit calculation for multiple source drugs that is based on percent of the lowest amp in a drug class  promotes transparency in drug pricing by requiring cms to post amp amounts on its web site  and establishes a uniform definition for amp 
additionally  the final rule provides that sales of drugs to long term care pharmacies for supply to nursing homes and assisted living facilities as well as associated discounts  rebates or other price concessions are not to be taken into account in determining amp where such sales can be identified with adequate documentation  and that any amps which are not at least of the next highest amp will not be taken into account in determining the upper limit amount the so called outlier test 
however  on december   the united states district court for the district of columbia issued a preliminary injunction that enjoins cms from implementing provisions of the july  rule to the extent that it affects medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies under the medicaid program 
the order also enjoins cms from posting amp data on a public website or disclosing it to states 
as a result of this preliminary injunction  cms did not post amps or new upper limit prices in late december based upon the july  final rule despite its earlier planned timetable  and the schedule for states to implement the new upper limits will be delayed until further notice 
with the advent of medicare part d  the company s revenues from state medicaid programs are substantially lower than has been the case previously 
however  some of the company s agreements with part d plans and other payors have incorporated the medicaid upper limit rules into the pricing mechanisms for prescription drugs 
until the new upper limit amounts are published by cms  the company cannot predict the impact of the final rule on the company s business 
there can be no assurance  however  that the changes under the dra or other efforts by payors to limit reimbursement for certain drugs will not have an adverse impact on the company s business 
president bush s fiscal year budget proposal includes a series of proposals impacting medicaid  including legislative and administrative changes that would reduce medicaid payments by more than billion over five years 
among other things  the proposed budget would further reduce the federal upper limit reimbursement for multiple source drugs to percent of the amp and replace the best price component of the medicaid drug rebate formula with a budget neutral flat rebate 
many of the proposed policy changes would require congressional approval to implement 
while the company has endeavored to adjust to these types of funding pressures in the past  there can be no assurance that these or future changes in medicaid payments to nursing facilities  pharmacies  or managed care systems  or their potential impact on payments under agreements with part d plans  will not have an adverse impact on its business 
two recent actions at the federal level could impact medicaid payments to nursing facilities 
the tax relief and health care act of modified several medicaid policies including  among other things  reducing the limit on medicaid provider taxes from percent to percent from january  through september  the bush administration had been expected to issue regulations calling for deeper cuts in this funding 
on march   cms published a proposed rule that would implement this legislation  and make other clarifications to the standards for determining the permissibility of provider tax arrangements 
second  on january   cms published a proposed rule designed to ensure that medicaid payments to governmentally operated nursing facilities and certain other health care providers are based on actual costs and that state financing arrangements are consistent with the medicaid statute 
cms estimates that the rule  if finalized  would save million during the first year and billion over five years 
on may   cms published a final rule to implement this provision  but congress blocked the rule for one year in an emergency fiscal year spending bill  hr on october   the plaintiffs in new england carpenters health benefits fund et al 
v 
first databank  inc and mckesson corporation  ca no 
cv pbs united district court for the district of massachusetts and defendant first databank  inc first databank entered into a settlement agreement relating to first databank s publication of average wholesale price awp 
awp is a pricing benchmark that is widely used to calculate a portion of the reimbursement payable to pharmacy providers for the drugs and biologicals they provide  including under state medicaid programs  medicare part d plans and certain of the company s contracts with long term care facilities 
the settlement agreement would require first databank to cease publishing awp two years after the settlement becomes effective unless a competitor of first databank is then publishing awp  and would require that first databank modify the manner in which it calculates awp until first databank ceases publishing same 
on june  the court granted preliminary approval to an amended settlement agreement 
in a related case  district council health and security plan v 
medi span  ca no 
cv pbs united states district court for the district of massachusetts  in which medi span is accused of misrepresenting pharmaceutical prices by relying on and publishing first databank s price list  the parties entered into a similar settlement agreement  and the court granted preliminary approval of the agreement on june   and granted amended preliminary approval of the agreement on august  on january   the court held a hearing on a motion for final approval of the proposed settlement 
the court heard various objections to the proposed settlement and indicated that it would not approve the settlement as proposed 
the court asked the parties to report back to it by february  with respect to various of the issues raised  and whether the settlement might be revised and additional evidence might be introduced to address these issues 
as of february   the case docket did not indicate that any such reports have been provided by the parties to the court 
the company is monitoring these cases for further developments and evaluating potential implications and or actions that may be required 
if a revised settlement or other resolution of the cases is proposed  the company will evaluate the potential impact of such settlement or other resolution on the company at that time  including any adverse effect on the company s reimbursement for drugs and biologicals and any actions that may be taken to offset or otherwise mitigate such impact 
longer term  funding for federal and state healthcare programs must consider the aging of the population and the growth in enrollees as eligibility is expanded  the escalation in drug costs owing to higher drug utilization among seniors and the introduction of new  more efficacious but also more expensive medications  the impact of the medicare part d program  and the long term financing of the medicare and medicaid programs 
given competing national priorities  it remains difficult to predict the outcome and impact on the company of any changes in healthcare policy relating to the future funding of the medicare and medicaid programs 
demographic trends indicate that demand for long term care will increase well into the middle of this century as the elderly population grows significantly 
moreover  those over consume a disproportionately high level of healthcare services  including prescription drugs  when compared with the under population 
there is widespread consensus that appropriate pharmaceutical care is generally considered the most cost effective form of treatment for the chronic ailments afflicting the elderly and also one that is able to improve the quality of life 
these trends not only support long term growth for the geriatric pharmaceutical industry but also containment of healthcare costs and the well being of the nation s growing elderly population 
in order to fund this growing demand  the company anticipates that the government and the private sector will continue to review  assess and possibly alter healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies 
while it cannot at this time predict the ultimate effect of the medicare part d drug benefit or any further initiatives on omnicare s business  management believes that the company s expertise in geriatric pharmaceutical care and pharmaceutical cost management position omnicare to help meet the challenges of today s healthcare environment 
further  while volatility can occur from time to time in the contract research business owing to factors such as the success or failure of its clients compounds  the timing or budgetary constraints of its clients  or consolidation within our client base  new drug discovery remains an important priority of drug manufacturers 
drug manufacturers  in order to optimize their research and development efforts  will continue to turn to contract research organizations to assist them in accelerating drug research development and commercialization
