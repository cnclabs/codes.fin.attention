acquisitions and comparability of results we acquired swreg in march  commerce  inc now dr globaltech  inc in december  direct response technologies  inc 
now dr marketing solutions  inc in january  mindvision  inc 
in june and netgiro systems ab in september the results of these acquisitions must be factored into any comparison of our results to the results for or see note of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   for pro forma financial information as if these entities had been acquired on january  critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from services rendered once all the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met pervasive evidence of an agreement exists  the services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment  and collection of the amounts due is reasonably assured 
we evaluate the criteria outlined in emerging issues task force  eitf issues no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as net revenue 
we act as the merchant of record on most of the transactions processed and have contractual relationships with our clients  which obligate us to pay to the client a specified percentage of each sale 
we derive our revenue primarily from transaction fees based on a percentage of the products sale price and fees from services rendered associated with the e commerce and other services provided to our clients and end customers 

table of contents our revenue is recorded as net as generally our clients are subject to inventory risks and control customers product choices 
clients do not have the right to take possession of the software applications used in the delivery of services 
we also provide customers with various proprietary software backup services 
we recognize revenue for these backup services upon delivery or based upon historical usage within the contract period of the digital backup services when this information is available 
digital backup services are recognized straight line over the life of the backup service when historical usage information is unavailable 
shipping revenues are recorded net of any associated costs 
we also  to a lesser extent  provide fee based client services  which include website design  custom development and integration  analytical marketing and email marketing services 
if we receive payments for fee based services in advance of delivery  these amounts are deferred and recognized over the service period 
provisions for doubtful accounts and transaction losses and authorized credits are made at the time of revenue recognition based upon our historical experience 
the provision for doubtful accounts and transaction losses are recorded as charges to operating expense  while the provision for authorized credits is recognized as a reduction of net revenues 
in june  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eift 
eitf provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
the company presents these taxes on a net basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates and assumptions that can affect the amount of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses we report in any financial reporting period 
we use estimates in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  which are based on our historical experience and current trends 
we must estimate the collectability of our billed accounts receivable 
we analyze accounts receivable and consider our historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make significant judgments and estimates in connection with the allowance in any accounting period 
there may be material differences in our operating results for any period if we change our estimates or if the estimates are not accurate 
credit card chargeback reserve 
we use estimates based on historical experience and current trends to determine accrued chargeback expenses 
significant management judgments are used and estimates made in connection with the accrued expenses in any accounting period 
there may be material differences in our operating results for any period if we change our estimates or if the estimates are not accurate 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment  amortize certain intangibles and certain other long lived assets with definite lives over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimates of the period of time over which the assets will generate revenue or benefit our business 
we review assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value we are carrying on our financial statements for an asset may not be recoverable 
our evaluation considers non financial data such as changes in the operating environment and business strategy  competitive information  market trends and operating performance 
if there are indications that impairment may be necessary  we use an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine the impairment amount  if any 
assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may be necessary utilizing the two step approach prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other 
table of contents intangible assets 
there have been no impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets for the years  and income taxes and deferred taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we record deferred tax assets for favorable tax attributes  including tax loss carryforwards 
we currently have significant us tax loss carryforwards consisting solely of acquired operating tax loss carryforwards  and a lesser amount of acquired foreign operating tax loss carryforwards 
a portion of the benefit of the acquired tax loss carryforwards has been reserved by a valuation allowance pursuant to united states generally accepted accounting principles 
these valuation reserves of the deferred tax asset will be reversed if and when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance of the deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis 
if the benefit of these acquired tax loss carryforwards is recognized  we will not recognize the benefit in the statement of income 
rather  the benefit will be recognized as a reduction to goodwill 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition  interest and penalties  and disclosure 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
no provision has been made for federal income taxes on approximately million of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of december  since we plan to indefinitely reinvest all such earnings 
if these earnings were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to us income taxes on such earnings 
the amount of us income taxes would be subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits and for the impact of the step up in the basis of assets resulting from a section election made at the time of acquisition 
it is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed 
stock based compensation expense 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payments made to employees and directors including stock options  restricted stock grants and employee stock purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  for periods beginning in prior to the adoption of sfas r  we had elected to apply the disclosure only provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended by sfas no 
accordingly  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb and related interpretations 
compensation expense for stock options was measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant over the stock option exercise price 
we have adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method under which prior periods are not revised 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based awards that are ultimately expected to vest during the period 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of income in and includes compensation expense for share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of december   as well as compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards is recognized using the straight line amortization method over the vesting period 
stock based 
table of contents compensation expense of million was charged to operating expenses during the related tax benefit of million resulted in a net after tax stock based compensation expense of million for as stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of income for is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
our pro forma information required under sfas  for periods prior to  accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
in march the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas r 
we have applied the provision of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation expense be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than an operating cash flow as required prior to adoption of sfas r in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected not to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
see note in the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further information regarding the impact of our adoption of sfas r and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share based compensation

these tax loss carryforwards consist solely of acquired net operating losses 
the us tax loss carryforwards expire in the years through in prior years  there was uncertainty of future realization of the deferred tax assets resulting from acquired us tax loss carryforwards due to anticipated limitations  including limitations under section of the internal revenue code irc

a valuation allowance remains on approximately million of deferred tax assets related to acquired operating losses and other tax attributes as we believe it is not more likely than not that these

in january  we filed a registration statement to increase our available shelf registration amount and we have approximately million for future use 
in addition  we filed an acquisition shelf for up to approximately million shares 
in february  we filed a shelf registration that would allow us to sell an undetermined amount of equity or debt securities in accordance with the recently approved rules applying to well known seasoned issuers 
these filings were made to provide future flexibility for acquisition and financing purposes 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
there can be no assurances that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
contractual obligations at december   our principal commitments consisted of interest and principal on our convertible senior notes and long term obligations outstanding under operating leases 
although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we anticipate continued capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel 
we expect that our operating expenses will continue to grow as our overall business grows and that they will be a material use of our cash resources 
payment due by period in thousands total amount and contractual obligations committed thereafter operating lease obligations convertible senior notes total with respect to our convertible senior notes  we are required to pay interest on the notes on january and july of each year

the notes may be surrendered for conversion under certain circumstances  including the satisfaction of a market price condition  such that the price of our common stock reaches a specified threshold  the satisfaction of a trading price condition  such that the trading price of the notes falls below a specified level  the redemption of the notes by us  the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  as defined in the related indenture  and the occurrence of a fundamental change  as defined in the related indenture 
the initial conversion price is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  of principal amount of the notes 
we will adjust the conversion price if certain events occur  as specified in the related indenture  such as the issuance of our common stock as a dividend or distribution or the occurrence of a stock subdivision or combination 
if a fundamental change  such as a change in our control  as defined in the related indenture  occurs on or before january   we also may be required to purchase the notes for cash and pay an additional make whole premium payable in our common stock  or in the same form of consideration into which all  or substantially  all of the shares of our common stock have been converted or exchanged in connection with the fundamental change  upon the repurchase or conversion of the notes in connection with the fundamental change

table of contents outlook we believe the outlook for our business remains positive for global online sales continue to increase and buyers appear to be increasingly comfortable shopping online 
in our core market  trends continue to favor the transition away from packaged  physical delivery of software to electronic download 
additionally  we see opportunities to grow our share of business in adjacent and complementary vertical markets such as consumer electronics and computer and video games 
we also see opportunities to expand our core service offerings in areas such as payment processing  subscriptions management and strategic marketing 
we anticipate making incremental investments in our people and technology in support of our strategic growth initiatives in we believe the initiatives outlined in our strategic plan will enable us to  continue to be a leader in the software delivery market  strengthen our product and service offering by investing in our core business  expand into new vertical markets such as consumer electronics  and computer and video games and supplement our growth through strategic acquisitions 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
this revised statement  which we refer to as sfas no 
r  is intended to simplify existing guidance and converge rulemaking under us gaap with international accounting rules 
sfas no 
r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas  including the treatment of contingent consideration  contingencies  acquisition costs and restructuring costs 
also under this statement  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement period will impact income tax expense 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier application encouraged 
any amounts recognized upon adoption as a cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
the company has not yet determined the impact of this statement on its financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements none item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments is maintained in a variety of securities  including government obligations and money market funds 
investments are classified as available for sale securities and carried at their market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
at december  and  all securities held had maturities or reset dates of less than three years 
a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the market value of certain securities in our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes or utilize derivative financial instruments 
a hypothetical and immediate one percent increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value in our investment portfolio held at december  and  by million and by million  respectively 
a hypothetical and immediate one percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value in our investment portfolio held at december  and  by million and by million  respectively 
the approximate gains or losses in earnings are estimates  and actual results could vary due to the assumptions used 
at december  and  we had 
table of contents million of fixed rate contingent convertible debt outstanding 
we presently believe there is minimal risk that market interest rates will drop significantly below 
foreign currency risk our business has historically been transacted primarily in the us dollar and  as such  has not been subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 
further  we recently acquired netgiro systems  a payment processor based in stockholm  sweden that processes international transactions  and the anticipated growth of this company will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of income 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues and operating expenses
