throughout this section  unless the context indicates otherwise  when we use the term the bank  we are referring to sun american bank 
in general  south florida real estate markets have declined in value throughout the company is predominantly a commercial lender in the south florida market place and is therefore exposed to the weakening real estate conditions in our south florida geographic region 
the company s financial results reflect the impact of these conditions through higher levels of non performing assets  increased loan loss reserves and compression of our net interest margin 
the company is reporting non performing assets of million at december  compared to  at december  it is the general consensus in the market place that the south florida real estate trend will remain depressed for the near future and therefore management can only offset this factor proactively in a limited way 
the company has proactively worked to mitigate the negative market impact on our financial results where possible 
we have reduced our overall exposure of the loan portfolio through scheduled loan amortizations and payoffs 
in select cases where we determined that the risk profile of specific loans had changed to exceed our acceptable limits  we have declined to renew the loan or guided customers to seek alternative financing 
further  the company sold loans or obtained additional collateral in order to reduce risk to the portfolio 
in an effort to increase the bank s new loan originations  the company has substantially added to the number of senior loan officers on staff to help develop new business 
as a result of this  the pipeline of new loans has started to build which should facilitate increased loan revenues  which we believe it will have a positive impact on our reslults in the medium term 
core deposit growth remains a competitive activity for the bank 
the market remains price sensitive and clients remain rate sensitive 
the bank has continued a policy to remain competitive in our market place but to adjust deposit pricing to meet funding needs over time 
our primary market and service area is miami dade  broward  palm beach and martin counties where we operated fifteen full service banking offices 
we have grown significantly in recent years due to the acquisition of certain assets  and assumption of certain liabilities  of panamerican bank in december  gulf bank in february and beach bank in in addition we merged with independent community bank in march since these transactions  we have pursued a strategy  increasing our level of earning assets  primarily through increases in the loan portfolio by concentrating on the origination of commercial loan products  by competitively pricing deposit products to grow client deposits while maintaining an interest rate spread  and by increasing the level of capital in support of this growth 
the periodic addition of new capital to support business growth is a core component required to permit us to realize growth plans 
in our business was primarily impacted by the acquisition of assets and assumption of liabilities from beach bank which closed on december  and by the merger of sun american bank with independent community bank on march  we focused significant resources in the first half of to integrate the operations of these acquisitions into our existing banking platform 
during the year ended december   our capital base was increased by approximately million primarily due to the issuance of million in connection with the merger of independent community bank and million to offset stock option expense 
this was offset by a net loss of million  and warrants and common stock buy backs of million 
in addition  capital was decreased by million in to reflect the impact of an anticipated recovery of capital stock to the company in connection with the beach bank acquisition transaction 
in the capital base was increased by million  represented by million due to the issuance of million shares of our common stock upon the closing of the beach bank transaction 
the capital base increased a further million through the exercise of our warrants and employee stock options 
we are committed to raising additional capital as require d to meet business growth requirements and maintain the bank s status as a well capitalized financial institution 
the bank s capital exceeded statutory guidelines at december  there were no dividends declared in the fiscal years ended december  and we intend to continue to expand our business through internal growth 
if opportunities arise that are deemed beneficial to the company involving mergers and acquisitions  they will be considered 
we intend to grow internally by adding to our loan portfolio and bringing in new deposits 
we also intend to grow our capital base on a continuing basis as it is part of our business strategy of maintaining a well capitalized position 
we intend to pursue this business strategy while managing asset quality 
as of december   we had total assets of million  net loans of million  deposits of million and stockholders equity of million 
average total assets increased by million during the fiscal year ended december  due to acquisition of million of assets from beach bank at the end of and the acquisition of million of assets from the merger with independent community bank in march capital growth corresponded with the overall growth of the bank due to issuance of million of capital in connection with the two acquisitions 
the average equity to average assets ratio decreased modestly in the year to during the fiscal year ended december  from during the fiscal year ended december  our results of operations are primarily dependent upon the results of operations of the bank 
the bank conducts a commercial banking business  which generally consists of attracting deposits from the general public  supplemented by federal home loan bank advances and capital infusions from us  and applying a majority of these funds typically to to the origination of commercial loans to small businesses  consumer loans  and secured real estate loans in its local trade area of south florida 
the balance of the bank s portfolio approximately to is generally held in cash and invested in government guaranteed or sponsored investment grade securities 
our profitability depends primarily on generating sufficient net interest income the difference between interest income received from loans and investments and the interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowings to offset operating expenses 
any excess thereof is pre tax profit earned by the bank 
the careful balance sought between the interest rate earned  frequency of rate changes  and interest rate paid to the bank s deposit base  determines the nature and extent to which it may be profitable 
for example  if the income generated by net interest income plus non interest income is in excess of operating expenses and loan loss reserves  the bank should be operating profitably 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges and fees on deposit accounts 
non interest expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation and benefits  occupancy and related expenses  data processing costs  deposit insurance premiums paid to the fdic  as well as other operating expenses 
in  the competition in our markets for low cost core deposits intensified 
we have responded to this situation by closely monitoring the interest rates paid on client deposits to ensure a balance of competitive rates to clients and minimizing the interest expense to the company 
we also continuously monitor operating expenses to maximize efficiency and profitability  particularly in periods where business growth slows down 
management s goal is to control the growth of operating expenses at a slower rate than the rate at which we grow our revenues 
to accomplish this goal  management continues to analyze our operations to find areas where costs can be reduced through greater efficiency or through renegotiated contracts 
in and we incurred higher expenses than in prior years due to the expansion of our branch network and due to other investments in our business infrastructure 
in we experienced a net loss of million compared to net income of million for the fiscal year ended december  and net income of million for the fiscal year ended december  the net loss in was primarily due to increased loan loss provisions of million booked in the fourth quarter of as well as a number of one time expenses associated with acquisition conversion costs  branch demolition costs  and litigation settlement costs 
independent community bank merger on march   the bank announced that independent community bank  a florida commercial banking association  merged with and into the bank with the bank being the surviving bank in the merger pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger by and among us  the bank and independent community bank 
upon consummation of the merger transaction  independent community bank common stock was converted into the right to receive shares of the company s common stock and or cash 
shareholders of independent community bank were entitled to elect to receive for each share of independent community bank common stock owned  subject to adjustments as provided in the merger agreement in cash  or shares of the company s common stock 
cash was paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares based on the formula set forth in the merger agreement 
cash utilized to fund the transaction came from internally generated funds 
based upon the  shares of independent community bank common stock outstanding on march   the company paid approximately million in cash including the cash out of options to purchase shares of independent community bank common stock held by independent community bank s directors  officers and employees and issued approximately million shares of its common stock in connection with the merger transaction to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of independent community bank 
beach bank acquisition on december   the company acquired in exchange for approximately million shares subject to adjustment as described in the agreement of the company s common stock substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities  of beach bank  which operated two branches in miami dade county  florida 
the acquisition agreement related to our acquisition transaction with beach bank provided that the total dollar value of the shares of our common stock to be issued and delivered by us  as consideration for the purchase of the assets and the assumption of the obligations from beach bank  was determined by multiplying times the book value of beach bank calculated based upon the final audited closing balance sheet prepared by beach bank 
the exact number of shares of our common stock issued in the acquisition transaction was required to be determined based upon the book value of beach bank as set forth in th e final  audited closing balance sheet  subject to adjustment as described in the agreement 
such final  audited balance sheet of beach bank was submitted to us on february  and was subject to review by us 
the company requested certain adjustments to the final balance sheet of beach bank 
the adjustments to the final balance sheet requested by us required the consent of the shareholder representative of the beach bank liquidating trust  michael kosnitzky  which was not provided 
the dispute was submitted to an independent registered public accounting firm to independently determine the correct accounting under united states generally accepted accounting principles in accordance with the terms provided for in the asset acquisition agreement 
on february   the independent accountant determined expense adjustments of  out of a possible  were required to be made to the final audited closing balance sheet of beach bank in favor of sun american 
the accounting resolution provided by the independent accounting firm was to be final and binding on both parties 
the beach bank liquidating trust is in process of seeking clarification and or modification of the independent accountant s decision 
if the accounting arbitration ruling is upheld  the beach bank liquidating trust will be required to return to sun american  transaction consideration totaling approximately million 
the actual number of shares to be returned to the company is not readily determinable at this time because it will be based upon the average daily trading price of the company s common stock for the ten days prior to the distribution 
in addition  the company will not be required to issue additional shares of common stock in the amount of approximately  that had previously been accrued for under the original accounting results provided by beach bank 
the accounting arbitration ruling is subject to review and adjustment under the general arbitration provisions of the asset acquisition agreement 
termination or rescission of the acquisition transaction is not contemplated 
for more information see note to consolidated financial statements 
conversion activities to integrate the operations of both the former beach bank and independent community bank operations into the normal operations of our bank were completed in the first half of critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the company has identified six policies as being critical because they require management to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
allowance for loan losses the company s accounting for the allowance for loan losses is a critical policy that is discussed in detail in this section see below the section entitled asset quality and nonperforming assets 
goodwill and intangible assets the company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually 
the test requires the company to determine the fair value of its reporting unit and compare the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using management valuation models 
while management believes the sources utilized to arrive at the fair value estimates are reliable  different sources or methods could have yielded different fair value estimates 
these fair value estimates require a significant amount of judgment 
changes in management s valuation of its reporting unit may affect future earnings through the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
at december  the goodwill impairment testing date the fair value of its reporting unit was greater than its carrying value  therefore  goodwill was not impaired 
if the fair value of reporting unit declines below the carrying amount  the company would have to perform the second step of the impairment test 
this step requires the company to determine the fair value of all assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
mergers and acquisitions the company accounts for its business combinations based on the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase method of accounting requires the company to determine the fair value of the tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the fair values are based on available information and current economic conditions at the date of acquisition 
the fair values may be obtained from independent appraisers  discounted cash flow present value techniques  management valuation models  quoted prices on national markets or quoted market prices from brokers 
these fair value estimates will affect future earnings through the disposition or amortization of the underlying assets and liabilities 
while management believes the sources utilized to arrive at the fair value estimates are reliable  different sources or methods could have yielded different fair value estimates 
such different fair value estimates c ould affect future earnings through different values being utilized for the disposition or amortization of the underlying assets and liabilities acquired 
acquired loans the company generally acquires loans through business combinations rather than individually or in groups or portfolios 
an acquired loan which has experienced deterioration of credit quality between origination and the acquisition  is accounted for under the provisions of statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
for such loans  the company estimates the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal  interest  and other cash flows including expected prepayments  if any as of the acquisition date 
the excess of the loan s contractually required cash flows over the company s expected cash flows is referred to as a nonaccretable difference and is not recorded by the company 
the loan is initially recorded at fair value  which represents the present value of the expected cash flows 
the difference between the undi scounted expected cash flows and the fair value at which the loan is recorded is referred to as accretable yield and is accreted into interest income over the remaining expected life of the loan 
on a quarterly basis  the company updates its estimate of cash flows expected to be collected 
if the estimated cash flows have decreased  the company creates a valuation allowance equal to the present value of the decrease in the cash flows and recognizes a loss 
if the estimated cash flows have increased  the company would first reverse any existing non accretable difference for that loan  and would then account for the remainder of the increase as an adjustment to the yield accreted on a prospective basis over the loan s remaining life 
investment securities the company records its securities available for sale in its statement of financial condition at fair value 
the company uses market price quotes for valuation 
the fair value of these securities in the company s statement of financial condition was based on the closing price quotations at period end 
the closing quotation represents inter dealer quotations without retail markups  markdowns or commissions and do not necessarily represent actual transactions 
as a consequence  the company may not be able to realize the quoted market price upon sale 
the company adjusts its securities available for sale to fair value monthly with a corresponding increase or decrease to other comprehensive income 
investments for which management has the intent and the company has the ability to hold to maturity  are carried at cost  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount 
amortization and accretion are calculated using the constant yield method over the term of the securities 
declines in the fair value of individual securities classified as either held to maturity or available for sale  below their cost that are other than temporary result in write downs of the individual securities to their fair value through the income statement 
during the second quarter of  the company sold an  par value investment security previously classified as held to maturity at a loss of  the security had been acquired as part of the beach bank transaction in december and carried over with the same balance sheet classification 
however  the security had been identified with credit weaknesses and rated below investment grade by the major rating agencies 
given that the company s asset liability management policy does not permit the holding of below investment grade securities  the company executed the sale 
management considers this a rare event and within the permissible circumstances promulgated by sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
further sales from the held to maturity portfolio are not expected 
income taxes the company files a consolidated federal income tax return 
the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax amounts to the amount expected to be realized 
asset quality and nonperforming assets a primary strategy of the company continues to be to maintain the level of earning assets as they relate to operating expenses in order to improve profitability 
the company is pursuing a growth strategy by increasing the level of earning assets  primarily through increases in loan origination in the communities the company serves and by increasing the level of capital in support of this growth 
interest earning assets  which consist of loans  investments  federal funds sold  federal home loan bank stock  and federal reserve bank stock  totaled million at december   a million  or  increase from million at december  this increase was due primarily to an increase in net loan assets of million from the merger with independent community bank in march and offset by a decrease in cash balances of million in earning assets of million at decemb er   represented a million  or  increase from million at december  of which an increase of million or of this increase resulted from the acquisition of earning assets from beach bank on december  lending activities the bank s principal lending areas have been defined as all census tracts within the four county areas of martin  palm beach  broward and miami dade counties  florida 
the bank s customers are predominantly small to medium sized businesses and individual consumers 
on occasion the bank also participates in loans that are presented to us for a portion of a larger loan relationship which may or may not be in our principal lending areas 
collateralized loans  the most common of which follow  are extended on similar terms to all of the bank s customers and have an inherent degree of risk cash secured loans as well as loans guaranteed by agencies of the united states government represent a nominal level of risk 
loans secured by marketable securities represent a low degree of risk 
commercial and residential real estate loans  including construction and land development loans  represent a moderate degree of risk 
loans secured by automobiles  boats and equipment represent a moderate to medium level of risk to the bank 
unsecured loans represent a high level of risk to the bank 
as a significant part of the company s growth strategy  it is increasing its efforts to develop new business relationships and is increasing its marketing efforts 
in we have added five new loan officers which have effectively doubled our capacity to source new loan opportunities 
typically  the company seeks commercial lending relationships with customers borrowing up to million 
the bank s legal lending limit for secured and unsecured loans was million and million as of december  during the company increased its capital base by million primarily through the capital issuance related to the merger with independent community bank 
the bank s legal lending limit for secured and unsecured loans was million and million as of december  and million and million as of december   respectively 
the legal lending limit decreased in from because the goodwill booked in the independent community bank merger exceeded the capital issued for the transaction 
during and  the company raised and million of new capital  net of issuance costs  respectively  through the acquisition of beach bank  exercise of stock options and warrants and  in  mostly through several share offerings of million and million of exercises of options and warrants 
increasing the bank s legal lending limit allows the bank to meet the loan needs of larger customers 
scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets 
the average life of a loan is substantially less than its contractual terms because of prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on mortgage loans generally give us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of loans tends to increase  however  when current loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing loans and  conversely  decrease when rates on existing loans are substantially higher than current loan market rates 
the bank extends credit with terms  rates and fees commensurate with those in its market place for like types of credit 
loan maturities may positively or negatively impact the bank s gap position and  ultimately  its profitability 
loan solicitation and processing 
loan applicants come primarily through the efforts of the bank s loan officers who seek out existing customers  referrals by realtors  previous and present customers of the bank  business acquaintances  and walk ins 
upon receipt of a loan application from a prospective borrower  a credit report and other data are obtained to verify specific information relating to the loan applicant s employment  income and credit standing 
on mortgage loans  an appraisal of the real estate offered as collateral generally is undertaken by an independent fee appraiser certified by the state of florida 
commercial real estate loans 
the bank s primary lending focus is making commercial mortgage loans to finance the purchase of real property  which generally consists of developed real estate and construction properties 
commercial mortgage loans are generally secured by first liens on real estate  and typically have variable rates and amortize over a to year period  with balloon payments due at the end of five to ten years 
at december   commercial mortgage loans represented of the total loan portfolio compared to and at december  and respectively 
the average balance of commercial mortgage loans was million for  million for and million for income from these loans totaled million  million and million for   and respectively 
residential real estate loans 
another of the bank s lending focus is making mortgage loans to finance the purchase of residential real property  which generally consists of improved one to four family and multi family properties 
residential mortgage loans are generally secured by first liens on real estate  and typically have variable rates and amortize over a to year period 
at december  residential real estate loans represented of the total loan portfolio compared to and at december  and respectively

a third lending focus of the bank is to small and medium sized businesses in a variety of industries 
the bank makes a broad range of short and medium term commercial lending products available to businesses  including working capital lines  purchases of machinery  and business expansion including acquisition of real estate and improvements 
at december  commercial loans represented of the total loan portfolio compared to of the portfolio at december  and compared to at december  the average balance of commercial loans was million for  million for and million for income from these loans totaled million for compared to million and million for and  respectively

loans to retail customers include residential mortgage loans  home equity loans and lines of credit  automobile loans  and other personal loans 
at december   consumer loans represented of the total loan portfolio compared to and of the portfolio at december  and december  respectively 
the average balance of consumer loans was million for and million and for income from these loans totaled million for and  and  for and  respectively 
loan portfolio summary 
major categories of loans included in the portfolio at december are as follows dollars in thousands commercial commercial real estate residential real estate consumer and home equity other net deferred loan fees allowance for loan losses net loans loan maturity schedule 
the following schedules set forth the time to contractual maturity of our loan portfolio at december  loans which have adjustable rates and fixed rates are all shown in the period of contractual maturity 
demand loans  loans having no contractual maturity and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less 
year ended december  total one year or less one through five years after five years dollars in thousands commercial commercial real estate residential real estate consumer and home equity other net deferred loan fees at december  fixed rate loans due after one year are approximately million and adjustable rate loans due after one year are approximately million 
asset quality 
management seeks to maintain a high quality of assets through conservative underwriting and sound lending practices 
the earning asset portfolio exclusive of investment securities is generally split into five categories  four of which are types of loans  and the fifth is other which includes overdrafts 
loan concentrations are defined as loans outstanding that are segregated into similar collateral types and or nature of cash flow income generation  which may cause a correspondingly similar impact with a particular economic or other condition 
we routinely monitor these concentrations in order to make necessary adjustments in lending practices that most clearly reflect the economic conditions and trends  loan ratios  loan covenants  asset valuations  and industry trends 
the percentage of loans in each category to total gross loans as of december  are as follows note the table excludes overdrafts as they collectively represent less than one percent of the total commercial loans commercial real estate loans residential real estate loans consumer and home equity total before allowance for loan losses in an effort to maintain the quality of the loan portfolio  management seeks to minimize higher risk loans 
in view of the relative significance of real estate related loans  a downturn in the value of real estate property could continue to have an adverse impact on profitability 
as part of the bank s loan policy and loan management strategy  we typically limit our loan to value ratio to a maximum of to depending on the type of real property being secured 
the use of qualified third party state certified appraisers for property valuations  and property inspections by knowledgeable bank officials helps mitigate real property loan risks 
the loan and discount committee of the board of directors of the bank concentrates its efforts and resources and that of its senior management and lending officers on loan review and underwriting procedures and standards 
internal controls include ongoing reviews of loans made to monitor documentation and ensure the existence and valuations of collateral  early detection of loan degradation  property inspections and review of regional economic conditions 
regulatory classification of assets 
our regulators consider loan assets to be classified when they are recorded in our records in the classifications of substandard  doubtful or loss 
as of december    and  the total dollar value of our classified assets was million  million and million respectively 
there were seventeen loans classified at the end of only three loans totaling  of this amount were included in the million balance at the end of the increase in classified loans in compared to was due to the downgrading of one commercial real estate construction loan that incurred cost overruns prompting the bank to advance additional funds and obtain additional collateral  as well as approximately million of impaired loans acquired in the beach bank transaction 
generally  interest on loans is accrued and credited to income based on the outstanding balance of the contract obligations of each loan or receivable contract 
it is the bank s policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income and classify loans or assets as non accrual when principal or interest is past due days or more and or the loan is not properly and or adequately collateralized  or if in the belief of the bank s management  principal and or interest is not likely to be paid in accordance with the terms of the obligation and or documentation 
as of december    and  delinquent and non accrual loans greater than days past due totaled million   and  respectively 
foreclosed assets 
assets acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure are classified as other real estate owned oreo if real estate  or in other assets  if other property  until they are sold 
these amounts are recorded at estimated fair value  less costs to sell the property  with any difference between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of the loan being charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent changes in fair value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount  not to exceed the initial carrying value of the assets at the time of transfer 
those subsequent changes  as well as any gains or losses recognized on the sale of these properties  are included in noninterest expense 
at december   the bank held  of oreo 
the bank held no oreo and repossessions at december  and  respectively 
non performing assets 
non performing assets consist of loans that are past due days or more which are still accruing interest  loans on nonaccrual status and other real estate owned and other foreclosed assets 
the following table sets forth information with respect to non performing assets identified by the bank for the years ended december dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans commercial commercial real estate residential real estate accrual loans past due days or more commercial restructured loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets on january  the bank sold a million condominium construction loan subsequently reducing non performing assets from million to million 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only  and the entire allowance is available to absorb probable and estimable credit losses inherent in the portfolio 
additions to the allowance may result from recording provision for loan losses or loan recoveries  while charge offs are deducted from the allowance 
management estimates the allowance for loan loss balance required by using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
for analytical purposes  the allowance consists of two components  non specific and specific 
non specific allowance the methodology used in establishing non specific allowances is based on a broad risk analysis of the portfolio 
all significant portfolio segments  including concentrations  are analyzed 
the amount of the non specific allowance is based upon a statistical analysis that derives appropriate formulas  which are adjusted by management s subjective assessment of current and future conditions related to the economy  our geographic location and other factors 
the determination includes an analysis of loss and recovery experience in the various portfolio segments over at least the last three fiscal years 
results of the historical loss analysis are adjusted to reflect current and anticipated conditions 
specific allowance all significant commercial and industrial loans that are classified as either substandard or doubtful are reviewed at the end of each period to determine if a specific reserve is needed for that credit 
the determination of a specific reserve for an impaired asset is evaluated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 and a specific reserve is very common for significant credits classified as either substandard or doubtful 
the establishment of a specific reserve does not necessarily mean that the credit with the specific reserve will definitely incur loss at the reserve level 
it is only an estimation of potential loss based upon anticipated events 
allowance for loan loss activity 
the allowance for loan loss as of december  was million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the  and allowance for loan losses included an allocated allowance of   and  related to acquisition of a loan portfolios in various acquisition transactions 
activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december  are as follows dollars in thousands balance  beginning amounts charged off commercial consumer and home equity commercial and residential real estate recoveries of amounts charged off commercial consumer and home equity commercial and residential real estate net charge offs recoveries provision for loan losses reclassification of reserve for unfunded commitments to other liabilities acquisition related adjustment balance  ending ratio of net charge offs recoveries to average loans outstanding during the period the adjustment in  and in is the allowance required on acquisition of loans from the independent community bank  beach bank and the gulf bank transactions  respectively  and exclusive of loans accounted under sop through the review of the loan portfolio  management determined that additional provisions were required in due to a increased charge offs of loans for which repayment is uncertain  b increased provisions to reflect the enhanced level of inherent risk in the portfolio due to the geographic and economic conditions in our market place  and  c growth of the loan portfolio 
increased provisions during and were due to portfolio growth 
management believes that the allowance for loan loss was adequate in relation to the overall loan portfolio based upon current market conditions 
the allowance is allocated to specific categories of loans for statistical purposes only  and may be applied to loan losses incurred in any loan category 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of december  was as follows dollars in thousands commercial loans commercial real estate loans residential real estate loans consumer and home equity total allowance for loan losses investment activities the bank is permitted under federal and state law to invest in various types of liquid assets  including us treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies and of state and municipal governments  deposits at the federal home loan bank  certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions  certain bankers acceptances and federal funds 
subject to various restrictions  we may also invest a portion of our assets in commercial paper and corporate debt securities 
as a federal reserve bank member bank  we are required to maintain an investment in federal reserve bank stock 
the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank and is required to maintain an investment in federal home loan bank stock 
under state and federal regulations  a certain amount of the investments must be liquid in nature 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  requires the investments be categorized as held to maturity  trading securities or available for sale  based on management s intent as to the ultimate disposition of each security 
sfas no 
allows debt securities to be classified as held to maturity and reported in financial statements at amortized cost only if the reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that might be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in the security s prepayment risk  increases in loan demand  or other similar factors cannot be classified as held to maturity 
debt and equity securities held for current resale are classified as trading securities 
such securities are reported at fair value  and unrealiz ed gains and losses on such securities would be included in earnings 
debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale 
such securities are reported at fair value  and unrealized gains and losses on such securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a net amount in a separate component of equity 
a committee consisting of bank officers and directors determines appropriate investments in accordance with the board of directors approved investment policies and procedures 
the bank s investment policies generally limit investments to us government and agency securities  municipal bonds  certificates of deposits  marketable corporate debt obligations  mortgage backed securities and certain types of mutual funds 
the bank s investment policy does not permit engaging directly in hedging activities or purchasing high risk mortgage derivative products 
investments are made based on certain considerations  which include the interest rate  yield  settlement date and maturity of the investment  the liquidity position  and anticipated cash needs and sources which in turn include outstanding commitments  upcoming maturities  estimated deposits and anticipated loan amortization and repayments 
the effect that the proposed investm ent would have on our credit and interest rate risk  and risk based capital is also given consideration during the evaluation 
mortgage backed securities which also are known as mortgage participation certificates or pass through certificates typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single family or multi family mortgages 
the principal and interest payments on these mortgages are passed from the mortgage originators  through intermediaries generally us government agencies and government sponsored enterprises that pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities  to investors such as the company 
such us government agencies and government sponsored enterprises  which guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors  primarily include freddie mac  fannie mae and the government national mortgage association 
mortgage backed securities typically are issued with stated principal amounts  and the securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with interest rates that fall within a specific range and ha ve varying maturities 
mortgage backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements 
in addition  mortgage backed securities are usually more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize certain of the bank s liabilities and obligations 
these types of securities also permit the bank to improve its regulatory capital because they have a low risk capital weighting 
investment portfolio

regulatory agencies require that the bank maintain sufficient liquidity to operate in a sound and safe manner 
the principal sources of liquidity and funding are generated by the operations of the bank through its diverse deposit base  loan participations and other asset liability measures 
for banks  liquidity represents the ability to meet loan commitments  withdrawals of deposit funds  and operating expenses 
the level and maturity of deposits necessary to support the lending and investment activities is determined through monitoring loan demand and through its asset liability management process 
considerations in managing the liquidity position include scheduled cash flows from existing assets  contingencies and liabilities  as well as projected liquidity conducive to efficient operations and are continuously evaluated as part of the asset liability management process 
historically  the bank has increased its level of deposits to allow for its planned asset growth 
the level of deposits is influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition  among other things 
south florida is a fast growing area with intense competition from other financial service providers 
management has found that adjusting pricing  or introducing new products  produces increased deposit growth 
adjusting the rate paid on money market and now accounts can quickly adjust the level of deposits

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the bank s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
the bank s income is derived primarily from the excess of interest collected on interest earning assets over the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the rates of interest earned on assets and owed on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
because market interest rates change over time  the bank is exposed to lower profitability if it cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
accepting interest rate risk can be an important source of profitability and stockholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk could pose a significant threat to our earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our safety and s oundness 
the bank s interest rate risk is monitored using its gap analysis on a monthly basis 
we do not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk 
even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the board of directors  management does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
asset liability management 
a principal objective of the bank s asset liability management strategy is to minimize its exposure to changes in interest rates by combination of matching and mis matching the maturity and repricing horizons of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
this strategy is overseen in part through the direction of the asset and liability committee of the bank  which establishes policies and monitors results to control interest rate sensitivity 
the asset and liability committee examines the extent to which the bank s assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and monitors its interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will be repriced or mature within the time period analyzed  usually one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within such time periods 
during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  and a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if the repricing of the bank s assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increases or decreases in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
however  as commercial banking companies generally have a significant quantity of their earning assets in rate over prime  rate adjusted day of change earning assets  gap management is critical  as it is difficult to reprice rate sensitive liabilities deposit accounts at such a rapid frequency 
the asset and liability committee evaluates the bank s gap position  and stratifies these results according to how often the repayment of particular assets and liabilities are impacted by changes in interest rates 
additionally  income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates  thus  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in general market rates 
additionally  certain types of earning assets variable rate mortgage loans  for example may have interest caps  which may limit the level of rate increases  even though general market interest rates increase 
gap management is further complicated by asset loan prepayment and or early withdrawal of liabilities deposits 
in volatile interest rate markets  the level of assets and liabilities assumed by the bank may not have accounted for the deviation that has occurred in the unpredictable interest rate environment 
therefore  management s and the asset and liability committee s strategy varies according to current and perceived future interest rate levels to protect the bank s net interest margin from market fluctuations 
they review  on at least a monthly basis  the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities for the various time periods considered 
the following table represents the bank s cumulative gap position as of december  the bank was liability sensitive at december  the bank s liability profile was intentionally shortened throughout in expectation of a falling interest rate environment 
within three months zero to twelve months zero to three years zero to five years over five years total dollars in thousands assets immediately repricing investments fixed investments loans total repricing assets nonearning assets total assets liabilities now accounts money market accounts savings accounts total core deposits certificates of deposit other borrowed funds total repricing liabilities demand deposits other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and equity asset liability gap  cumulative rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities  cumulative target effect of government policy  future legislation and changing financial markets one of the primary determinants of the company s future success and profitability is the interest rate differentials obtained by the bank 
the bank s earning capacity will be largely controlled by the difference between the interest rate paid on its deposits and other borrowings and the interest rates received on loans to customers and securities held in its investment portfolio 
the value and yields of its assets and the rate paid on its liabilities are sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest 
consequently  the earnings and growth of the company will be influenced by general economic conditions  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and policies of regulatory agencies which implement national monetary policy 
the nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
the entire regulatory environment which controls the banking industry in the united states is undergoing s ignificant change  both as to the banking industry itself and the permissible competition between banks and non banking financial institutions 
there have been significant regulatory changes in the areas of bank mergers and acquisitions  the products and services offered by banks and the non banking activities in which bank and financial service holding companies may engage 
partly as a result of such changes  banks are now actively competing with other types of depository institutions and with non bank financial institutions such as money market funds  brokerage firms  insurance companies and other financial services organizations 
it is not possible at this time to assess what impact these changes will ultimately have on the company and its operations 
certain legislative and regulatory proposals that could affect the company are pending  or may be introduced  in the united states congress  the florida legislature and various other governmental agencies 
these proposals could further alter the structure  r egulation and competitive relationship of financial institutions and may subject the company to increased regulation  disclosure and reporting requirements 
in addition  the various banking regulatory agencies frequently propose rules and regulations to implement and enforce already existing legislation 
we cannot predict whether or in what form any future legislation or regulations will be enacted or to the extent to which the business of the company will be affected by such matters 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the assets and liabilities of the company are primarily monetary in nature and management believes that changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on its performance than do the effects of inflation in the current environment
