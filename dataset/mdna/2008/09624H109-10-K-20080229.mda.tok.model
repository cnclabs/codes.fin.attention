overview company background bluelinx is a leading distributor of building products in the united states 
we measure our market share based on data published annually by home channel news  or hcn 
we define market share as our sales as a percentage of the reported sales of the firms on hcn s list  as adjusted to eliminate firms that do not compete with us and  for certain firms  the portion of their sales attributable to businesses that do not compete with us 
as of december   we distributed more than  products to approximately  customers through our network of more than warehouses and third party operated warehouses which serve all major metropolitan markets in the united states 
we distribute products in two principal categories structural products and specialty products 
structural products include plywood  osb  rebar and remesh  lumber and other wood products primarily used for structural support  walls and flooring in construction projects 
structural products represented approximately and of our fiscal and fiscal gross sales  respectively 
specialty products include roofing  insulation  moulding  engineered wood  vinyl products used primarily in siding and metal products excluding rebar and remesh 
specialty products accounted for approximately and of our fiscal and fiscal gross sales  respectively 

table of contents selected factors that affect our operating results our operating results are affected by housing starts  mobile home production  industrial production  repair and remodeling spending and non residential construction 
the table below shows changes with respect to each of these indicators for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal included are our estimates of the relative weight of each of the foregoing end use markets on our sales  based on the estimated percentage each end market contributed to our net sales over the applicable period 
these end use market weights are estimates based on our current methodology for evaluating such end use markets and could change in the future as our business continues to evolve in relation to these markets

gross profit for fiscal was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the decrease in gross profit dollars compared to fiscal was primarily driven by a decrease in specialty and structural product volumes due to the continued decline in the housing market 
the increase in gross margin of is primarily attributable to a shift toward the warehouse channel  which typically provides higher gross margins  and a slight shift in product mix from structural to higher margin specialty products  offset in part by a decline in underlying product prices compared to the prior year as well as our stock keeping unit sku rationalization initiative during the fourth quarter of we estimate that the sku rationalization program negatively impacted gross margin by approximately basis points in fiscal during fiscal  we remained focused on maintaining gross margin through our ongoing management of structural product pricing

seasonality we are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors 
these seasonal factors are common in the building products distribution industry 
the first and fourth quarters are typically our slowest quarters due to the impact of poor weather on the construction market 
our second and third quarters are typically our strongest quarters  reflecting a substantial increase in construction due to more favorable weather conditions 
our working capital and accounts receivable and payable generally peak in the third quarter  while inventory generally peaks in the second quarter in anticipation of the summer building season 
we expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources we depend on cash flow from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility to finance working capital needs  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
we believe that the amounts available from this and other sources will be sufficient to fund our routine operations and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
part of our growth strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions 
accordingly  depending on the nature of the acquisition or currency  we may use cash or stock  or a combination of both  as acquisition currency 
our 
table of contents cash requirements may significantly increase and incremental cash expenditures will be required in connection with the integration of the acquired company s business and to pay fees and expenses in connection with any acquisitions 
to the extent that significant amounts of cash are expended in connection with acquisitions  our liquidity position may be adversely impacted 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing acquisitions in the future or in implementing our acquisition strategy 
for a discussion of the risks associated with our acquisition strategy  see the risk factor integrating acquisitions may be time consuming and create costs that could reduce our net income and cash flows set forth under item a risk factors

additionally  cash decreased from million at december  to million at december  the million of cash on our balance sheet at december  primarily reflects customer remittances received in our lock boxes on friday and saturday that are not available until the next monday  which is part of the following fiscal period 
operating activities during fiscal  cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million 
the primary driver of cash flow from operations was an increase in cash flow from operations related to working capital of million reflecting decreases in accounts receivable and a reduction in inventory  partially offset by a net loss  as adjusted for non cash charges  of million 
during fiscal  cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million 
the primary drivers of cash flow from operations were net income  as adjusted for non cash charges  of million and an increase in cash flow from operations related to working capital of million reflecting decreases in accounts receivable and a reduction in structural product inventory  partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and a slight increase in specialty products inventory 
during fiscal  cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million

during fiscal and fiscal  our acquisition related expenditures totaled and million  respectively 
during fiscal and fiscal  our expenditures for property and equipment were million and million  respectively 
these expenditures were primarily for mobile equipment consisting of trucks  trailers  forklifts and sales force automobiles 
we estimate that capital expenditures for will be approximately million for normal operating activities 
our capital expenditures are anticipated to be paid from our current cash and cash provided from operating activities 
proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment totaled million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the proceeds of million during fiscal include million from an insurance settlement related to property damage from hurricane katrina 
during fiscal  cash flows used for investing activities totaled million 
the primary driver of cash flows from investing activities in fiscal were acquisition related expenditures and expenditures for property and equipment of million and million  respectively 
the expenditures for property and equipment were primarily for mobile equipment 
proceeds from the sale of property and equipment totaled million in fiscal financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal and million during fiscal the million increase in cash flows used in financing activities was primarily driven by proceeds from the new mortgage received during fiscal  in the amount of million 
this increase in cash flows used in financing activities was partially offset by the retirement of the old mortgage of million in fiscal and an increase in the revolving credit facility of million 
in addition  there were decreases in debt financing costs of million 
we paid dividends to our common stockholders in the aggregate amount of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal  which primarily resulted from a net decrease in the revolving credit facility of million which was partially offset by an increase in bank overdrafts of million 
debt and credit sources as of december   advances outstanding under our revolving credit facility were approximately million 
borrowing availability was approximately million and outstanding letters of credit on this facility were approximately million

on june   certain special purpose entities that are wholly owned subsidiaries of ours entered into a million mortgage loan with the german american capital corporation 
the mortgage has a term of ten years and is secured by distribution facilities and office building owned by the special purpose entities 
the stated interest rate on the mortgage is fixed at 
the mortgage loan requires interest only payments for the first five years followed by level monthly payments of principal and interest based on an amortization period of thirty years 
the balance of the loan outstanding at the end of ten years will then become due and payable 
german american capital corporation assigned half of its interest in the new mortgage loan to wachovia bank  national association 
the new mortgage loan replaced our previously existing million floating rate mortgage  which had a interest rate at the time it was terminated 
we used the net proceeds 
table of contents we received from the mortgage refinancing to pay down approximately million of our outstanding revolving line of credit 
on june   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with goldman sachs capital markets  to hedge against interest rate risks related to our variable rate revolving credit facility 
the interest rate swap has a notional amount of million and the terms call for us to receive interest monthly at a variable rate equal to the day libor and to pay interest monthly at a fixed rate of 
this interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge 
we expect the hedge to be highly effective in offsetting changes in expected cash flows  as  at inception  the critical terms of the interest rate swap generally match the critical terms of the variable rate revolving credit facility 
fluctuations in the fair value of the ineffective portion  if any  of the cash flow hedge are reflected in current period earnings 
these amounts were immaterial during fiscal and fiscal at december  and december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of million and million  respectively 
these balances were included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
accumulated other comprehensive income at december  and december  included the net loss on the cash flow hedge net of tax of million and million  respectively  which reflects the cumulative amount of comprehensive loss in connection with the change in fair value of the swap 
additionally  interest was capped pursuant to a rate cap agreement that caps day libor exposure at on million of our variable rate revolving credit facility 
the interest rate cap agreement expired in november fluctuations in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement were recognized in current period earnings 
these amounts  as well as the fair value of the cap  were immaterial during fiscal contractual commitments

amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet to the extent entered into prior to the end of the applicable period as accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
as with all judgments  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on the company s historical experience  current economic trends in the industry  information provided by customers  vendors and other outside sources and management s estimates  as appropriate 
the following are accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on shipping terms 
revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated as fob free on board shipping point 
for sales transactions designated fob destination  revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer s delivery site 
all product sales are recorded at gross in accordance with the guidance outlined by eitf and in accordance with standard industry practice 
the key indicators used to determine this are as follows we are the primary obligor responsible for fulfillment  we hold title to all reload inventory and are responsible for all product returns  we control the selling price for all channels  we select the supplier  and we bear all credit risk 
we also provide delivery and product management services for which the associated revenues are recognized upon completion of services 
these revenues represent less than of our net sales 
all revenues recognized are net of trade allowances  cash discounts and sales returns 
cash discounts and sales returns are estimated using historical experience 
trade allowances are based on the estimated obligations and historical experience 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on discounts and returns have been insignificant for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts and related reserves we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with customers and their creditworthiness 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for each aging category on our aged trial balance based on our historical loss experience 
this estimate is periodically adjusted when we become aware of specific customers inability to meet their financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filing or other evidence of liquidity problems 
as we determine that specific balances will be ultimately uncollectible  we remove them from our aged trial balance 
additionally  we maintain reserves for cash discounts that we expect customers to earn as well as expected returns 
at december  and december   these reserves totaled million and million  respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on discounts and uncollectible accounts have been insignificant for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal 
table of contents inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of all inventories is determined by the moving average cost method 
we evaluate our inventory value at the end of each quarter to ensure that first quality  actively moving inventory  when viewed by category  is carried at the lower of cost or market 
at december   the lower of cost or market reserve totaled million 
the market value of our inventory exceeded its cost at december  additionally  we maintain a reserve for the estimated value impairment associated with damaged and inactive inventory 
the inactive reserve includes inventory that has had no sales in the past six months or has turn days in excess of days  excluding some specific specialty product items  or is being discontinued 
at december  and december   our damaged and inactive inventory reserves totaled million and million  respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to inactive estimates have been insignificant for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
prior to  we accounted for stock awards granted to employees under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation expense recognized in fiscal and fiscal included a compensation expense for all unvested share based awards granted prior to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no 
and b compensation expense for all share based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no 
r 
results of prior periods have not been restated 
through december   we accrued compensation expense assuming that all stock options granted were expected to vest 
the effect of actual forfeitures was recognized as forfeitures occurred 
under sfas no 
r  we are required to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to stock based compensation 
the adoption of sfas no 
r did not have a material impact on our results of operations 
compensation expense arising from stock based awards granted to employees and non employee directors is recognized as expense using the straight line method over the vesting period 
as of december   there was million  million million and million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance shares  respectively 
the unrecognized compensation expense for stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance shares is expected to be recognized over a period of years  years  years and years  respectively 
for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal our total stock based compensation expense was million  million  and million  respectively 
we also recognized related income tax benefits of million  million and million  respectively 
consideration received from vendors and paid to customers each year  we enter into agreements with many of our vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates  generally based on achievement of specified volume purchasing levels and various marketing allowances that are common industry practice 
we accrue for the receipt of vendor rebates based on purchases  and also reduce inventory value to reflect the net acquisition cost purchase price less expected purchase rebates 
at december  and december   the vendor rebate receivable totaled million and million  respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to rebate estimates have been insignificant for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal 
table of contents in addition  we enter into agreements with many of our customers to offer customer rebates  generally based on achievement of specified volume sales levels and various marketing allowances that are common industry practice 
we accrue for the payment of customer rebates based on sales to the customer  and also reduce sales value to reflect the net sales sales price less expected customer rebates 
at december  and december   the customer rebate payable totaled million and million  respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to rebate estimates have been insignificant for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets with definite useful lives  are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  their amount and the asset s residual value  if any 
in turn  measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value  which is based on the best information available 
we use internal cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset less any costs of disposition 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
there have been no adjustments to earnings resulting from the impairment of long lived assets for fiscal  fiscal or fiscal income taxes deferred income tax assets and income tax benefits are provided for temporary differences between amounts recorded for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
if  for some reason  the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of temporary differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years or carried forward to future years to recover the deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required 
sfas no 
requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  our ability to carryback losses against prior taxable income  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income 
the company has recorded deferred income tax assets of million at december   reflecting the benefit of million of deductible temporary differences 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income 
the company believes the deferred income tax assets will be realized through taxable income generated during available loss carryback periods and future taxable income  including but not limited to taxable income that would be generated by the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of taxable income available via loss carryback are reduced or if we are unable to implement existing tax planning strategies 
during  we will continue to closely monitor the current economic downturn in the housing and construction sectors on a 
table of contents quarterly basis 
should conditions reach a level during that necessitates the recording of a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets based upon all of the evidence  both positive and negative  it will be recorded in the period that such changes in estimates are made 
the recording of a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
in  we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return including a discussion of whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction 
the cumulative effect of applying fin is reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
adoption of fin on december  did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million related to certain cost reduction initiatives 
in connection with those cost reduction initiatives  we vacated leased office space 
we accounted for the transaction in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires that a liability be recognized for the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity at fair value in the period in which it is incurred or when the entity ceases using the right conveyed by a contract ie  the right to use a leased property 
our restructuring charges include the estimated losses on the vacated facility based on our contractual obligations net of estimated sublease income based on current comparable market rates for leases 
we will reassess this liability periodically based on market conditions 
revisions to our estimates of this liability could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions  such as the timing and amounts of sublease rental income  either do not materialize or change 
these costs were included in selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations and in other current liabilities  and in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december  recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks such as changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we employ a variety of practices to manage these risks  including operating and financing activities and  where deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading  and are not used to address risks related to foreign currency exchange rates 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  we record derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
less than of our net sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and we do not believe our total exposure to currency fluctuations to be significant 
we believe that general inflation did not significantly affect our operating results or markets in fiscal  fiscal or fiscal as discussed above  our results of operations were both favorably and unfavorably impacted by increases and decreases in the pricing of certain commodity based products 
commodity price fluctuations have from time to time created cyclicality in our financial performance and may do so in the future 
on june   certain special purpose entities that are wholly owned subsidiaries of ours entered into a million mortgage loan with the german american capital corporation 
the new mortgage has a term of ten years and a fixed interest rate of 
by entering into this mortgage  we insulated ourselves from changes in market interest rates on a portion of our indebtedness 
this mortgage replaced our previously existing million floating rate mortgage  which had a interest rate when it was terminated and replaced with the fixed rate mortgage loan 
on june   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with goldman sachs capital markets  to hedge against interest rate risks related to our variable rate revolving credit facility 
the interest rate swap has a notional amount of million and the terms call for us to receive interest monthly at a variable rate equal to the day libor and to pay interest monthly at a fixed rate of 
this interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge 
we expect the hedge to be highly effective in offsetting changes in expected cash flows  as  at inception  the critical terms of the interest rate swap generally match the critical terms of the variable rate revolving

fluctuations in the fair value of the ineffective portion  if any  of the cash flow hedge are reflected in current period earnings 
these amounts were immaterial during fiscal and fiscal at december  and december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of million and million  respectively 
these balances were included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
accumulated other comprehensive income at december  and december  included the net loss on the cash flow hedge net of tax of million and million  respectively  which reflects the cumulative amount of comprehensive loss in connection with the change in fair value of the swap 
additionally  interest was capped pursuant to a rate cap agreement that caps day libor exposure at on million of our variable rate revolving credit facility 
the interest rate cap agreement expired in november fluctuations in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement were recognized in current period earnings 
these amounts  as well as the fair value of the cap  were immaterial during fiscal our revolving credit facility accrues interest based on a floating benchmark rate the prime rate or libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
a change in interest rates under the revolving credit facility would have an impact on our results of operations 
a change of basis points in the market rate of interest would impact interest expense by approximately million based on borrowings outstanding at december  additionally  to the extent changes in interest rates impact the housing market  we would be impacted by such changes
