item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and sell application optimized  high performance server solutions based on an innovative  modular and open standard x architecture 
our solutions include a range of complete rackmount and blade server systems  as well as components which can be used by distributors  oems and end customers to assemble server systems 
to date  we have generated the majority of our net sales from components 
since  we have gradually shifted our focus and resources to designing  developing  manufacturing and selling application optimized server systems 
in recent years our growth in net sales has been driven by the growth in the market for application optimized server systems 
for fiscal years  and  net sales of optimized servers were million  million  and million  respectively 
we commenced operations in and have been profitable every year since inception 
for fiscal years  and  our net sales were million  million and million  respectively  and our net income was million  million and million  respectively 
we sell our server systems and components primarily through distributors and to a lesser extent to oems as well as through our direct sales force 
for fiscal years  and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales from products sold to distributors  and we derived approximately  and  respectively  from sales to oems and to end customers 
none of our customers accounted for or more of our net sales in fiscal years  or for fiscal years  and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales from customers in the united states 
for fiscal years  and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales from customers outside the united states 
we perform the majority of our research and development efforts in house 
for fiscal years  and  research and development expenses represented approximately  and of our net sales  respectively 
we use several suppliers and contract manufacturers to design and manufacture components in accordance with our specifications  with most final assembly and testing performed at our manufacturing facility in san jose  california 
this arrangement enables us to maintain our cost structure and to benefit from our suppliers and contract manufacturers research and development and economies of scale 
one of our key suppliers is ablecom  which supplies us with contract design and manufacturing support 
for fiscal years  and  our purchases from ablecom represented approximately  and of our cost of sales  respectively 
the decrease in percentage of cost of sales was primarily due to our higher product mix of serverboards and other components to our server systems which are purchased from other sources 
ablecom s sales to us constitute a substantial majority of ablecom s net sales 
we continue to expand our warehousing capacity and our manufacturing relationship with ablecom in asia in an effort to reduce our product costs 
in addition to providing a larger volume of contract manufacturing services for us  ablecom continues to warehouse for us an increasing number of components and subassemblies manufactured by multiple suppliers prior to shipment to our facilities in the us and europe 
we typically negotiate the price of products that we purchase from ablecom on a quarterly basis  however  either party may re negotiate the price of products with each order 
as a result of our relationship with ablecom  it is possible that ablecom may in the future sell 
table of contents products to us at a price higher or lower than we could obtain from an unrelated third party supplier 
this may result in our reporting for one or more periods gross profit as a percentage of net sales less than or in excess of what we might have obtained absent our relationship with ablecom 
in order to continue to increase our net sales and profits  we believe that we must continue to develop flexible and customizable server solutions and be among the first to market with new features and products 
we measure our financial success based on various indicators  including growth in net sales  gross profit as a percentage of net sales  operating income as a percentage of net sales  levels of inventory  and days sales outstanding  or dsos 
in connection with these efforts  we monitor daily and weekly sales and shipment reports 
among the key non financial indicators of our success is our ability to rapidly introduce new products and deliver the latest application optimized server solutions 
in this regard  we work closely with microprocessor and other component vendors to take advantage of new technologies as they are introduced 
we also solicit input from our customers to understand their future needs as we design and develop our products 
fiscal year our fiscal year ends on june references to fiscal year  for example  refer to the fiscal year ended june  revenues and expenses net sales 
net sales consist of sales of our server solutions  including server systems and components 
the main factors which impact our net sales are unit volumes shipped and average selling prices 
the prices for server systems range widely depending upon the configuration  and the prices for our components vary based on the type of component 
as with most electronics based products  average selling prices typically are highest at the time of introduction of new products which utilize the latest technology and tend to decrease over time as such products mature in the market and are replaced by next generation products 
cost of sales 
cost of sales primarily consists of the costs to manufacture our products  including the costs of materials  contract manufacturing  shipping  personnel and related expenses  equipment and facility expenses  warranty costs and inventory write offs 
the primary factors that impact our cost of sales are the mix of products sold and cost of materials  which include raw material costs  shipping costs and salary and benefits related to production 
we expect cost of sales to increase in absolute dollars in the future from an expected increase in net sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales may increase over time if decreases in average selling prices are not offset by corresponding decreases in our costs 
our cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  is generally lower on server systems than on components 
because we do not have long term fixed supply agreements  our cost of sales is subject to change based on market conditions 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist of the personnel and related expenses of our research and development teams  and materials and supplies  consulting services  third party testing services and equipment and facility expenses related to our research and development activities 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we occasionally receive non recurring engineering  or nre funding from certain suppliers and customers towards our development efforts 
under these programs  we are reimbursed for certain research and development costs that we incur as part of the joint development of our products and those of our suppliers and customers 
these amounts offset a portion of the related research and development expenses and have the effect of reducing our reported research and development expenses 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we increase our investment in developing new products and adding new features in current products  but such expenditures may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for our sales and marketing personnel  costs for tradeshows  independent sales representative fees and marketing programs 
from time to time  we receive cooperative marketing funding from certain suppliers 
under these 
table of contents programs  we are reimbursed for certain marketing costs that we incur as part of the joint promotion of our products and those of our suppliers 
these amounts offset a portion of the related expenses and have the effect of reducing our reported sales and marketing expenses 
similarly  we from time to time offer our distributors cooperative marketing funding which has the effect of increasing our expenses 
the timing  magnitude and estimated usage of our programs and those of our suppliers can result in significant variations in reported sales and marketing expenses from period to period 
spending on cooperative marketing  either by us or our suppliers  typically increases in connection with significant product releases by us or our suppliers 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars  but that such expenditures will decline as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of general corporate costs  including personnel expenses  financial reporting  corporate governance and compliance and outside legal  audit and tax fees 
we expect general and administrative expenses to have no significant changes on an absolute dollar basis to support our anticipated growth  but such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
although we expect such items to increase to support the anticipated growth  such items will be largely offset due to the expected reduction of compliance costs related to section of the sarbanes oxley act 
provision for reversal of litigation loss 
loss from litigation relates to an action filed in france by digitechnic  sa  a former customer  alleging that certain products purchased from us were defective 
in september  the court found in favor of digitechnic and awarded damages totaling million 
in february  the court of appeals dismissed the claims 
digitechnic appealed the decision to the french supreme court and asked for  for damages 
on february   the french supreme court reversed the decision of the paris court of appeals  ordering a new hearing before a different panel of the paris court of appeals 
pending a new hearing  the trial court ruling is reinstated 
although we cannot predict with certainty the final outcome of this litigation  we believe the claims to be without merit and intend to continue to defend against them vigorously 
we believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
we accrued  in fiscal year for the payment of estimated fines related to export control matters arising in prior years 
in august  september and november  we entered into settlement agreements regarding certain claims relating to the sale of its products in violation of export control laws 
in august  we entered into a plea agreement with the us department of justice  the principal terms of which included entering a guilty plea to one charge of violating federal export regulations and payment of approximately  in fines 
the plea agreement has been approved by the us district court 
we have also entered into a settlement agreement with the bureau of industry and security of the department of commerce pursuant to which we have acknowledged violations of the export administration regulations and agreed to pay a fine of approximately  finally  on november   we entered into a settlement agreement with the office of foreign assets control of the department of the treasury ofac  pursuant to which we made a payment of a fine of  we believe that all issues with respect to the matters under investigation have been resolved as to the company 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net represents the net of our interest income on investments or interest expense on the building loans for our owned facilities and a small business administration loan offset by interest earned on our cash balances 
income tax provision 
our income tax provision is based on our taxable income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate  currently primarily the united states and the netherlands and to a lesser extent  taiwan 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax benefit of tax exempt interest income  research and development tax credits and the extraterritorial income exclusion 
a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in future years  we anticipate our effective tax rate will increase due to the phase out of the extraterritorial income exclusion 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to cooperative marketing accruals  investment valuations  inventory valuations  income taxes  warranty obligations and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments we make about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because these estimates can vary depending on the situation  actual results may differ from the estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they require our more significant judgments in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we account for revenue under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
under the provisions of sab no 
 we recognize revenue from sales of products  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred and title has transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  and all significant obligations have been met 
generally this occurs at the time of shipment when risk of loss and title has passed to the customer 
our standard arrangement with our customers includes a signed purchase order or contract  free on board shipping point terms  except for a few customers who have free on board destination terms and revenue is recognized when the products arrive at the destination  to days payment terms  and no customer acceptance provisions 
we generally do not provide for non warranty rights of return except for products which have out of box failure  where customers could return these products for credit within days of receiving the items 
certain distributors and oems are also permitted to return products in unopened boxes  limited to purchases over a specified period of time  generally within to days of the purchase  or to products in the distributor s or oem s inventory at certain times such as the termination of the agreement or product obsolescence 
in addition  we have a sale arrangement with an oem that has limited product return rights 
to estimate reserves for future sales returns  we regularly review our history of actual returns for each major product line 
we also communicate regularly with our distributors to gather information about end customer satisfaction  and to determine the volume of inventory in the channel 
reserves for future returns are adjusted as necessary  based on returns experience  returns expectations and communication with our distributors 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ability to pay 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable based upon the review process  the customers are required to pay cash in advance of shipment 
we provide for price protection to certain distributors 
we assess the market competition and product technology obsolescence  and make price adjustments based on our judgment 
upon each announcement of price reductions  the accrual for price protection is calculated based on our distributors inventory on hand 
such reserves are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time we reduce the product prices in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
credits that we issued pursuant to these provisions were   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we do not commit to future price reductions with any of our customers 
we have an immaterial amount of service revenue relating to non warranty repairs  which is recognized upon shipment of the repaired units to customers 
service revenue has been less than of net sales for all periods presented and is not separately disclosed 

table of contents cooperative marketing accruals 
we follow emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
we have arrangements with resellers of our products to reimburse the resellers for cooperative marketing costs meeting specified criteria 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 we record advertising costs meeting such specified criteria within sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
for those advertising costs that do not meet the criteria set forth in eitf issue no 
 the amounts are recorded as a reduction to sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
prior to fiscal year  we had recognized the maximum potential amount of the reimbursement for which the resellers were entitled as we lacked sufficient historical experience to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount that might expire unclaimed 
beginning in fiscal year  we determined that we had sufficient history of unclaimed cooperative marketing funds to make reasonably reliable estimates 
accordingly  beginning in fiscal year we began reducing our accrual for cooperative marketing funds for our estimate of amounts that will not be claimed 
this change in accounting estimate had a favorable impact on income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended june  of approximately  the effect on net income for fiscal year was an increase of approximately  and the effect on earnings per common share was an increase of per basic share and per fully diluted share 
impairment of long term investments 
impairment of long term investments relates to the unrealized loss on the carrying value of our investments in auction rate securities  such securities were rated aaa at the date of purchase 
the liquidity and fair value of these securities has been negatively impacted by the uncertainty in the credit markets and the exposure of these securities to the financial condition of bond insurance companies 
we have received all interest payments due on these instruments on a timely basis 
each of these securities had been subject to auction processes for which there had been insufficient bidders on the scheduled rollover dates and the auctions have subsequently failed 
when these securities lost the short term liquidity previously provided by the auction processes  we reclassified these securities as long term investments 
we have used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of these investments as of june  the factors used in such models are subject to judgement by management 
changes in these estimates or in the market conditions for these investments may affect the fair value of these long term investments 
product warranties 
we offer product warranties ranging from to months against any defective product 
we accrue for estimated returns of defective products at the time revenue is recognized  based on historical warranty experience and recent trends 
we monitor warranty obligations and may make revisions to our warranty reserve if actual costs of product repair and replacement are significantly higher or lower than estimated 
accruals for anticipated future warranty costs are charged to cost of sales and included in accrued liabilities 
inventory valuation 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate inventory on a quarterly basis for excess and obsolescence and write down the valuation of units that are unlikely to be sold based upon estimated demand for the following twelve months 
this evaluation may take into account matters including expected demand  anticipated sales price  product obsolescence and other factors 
if actual future demand for our products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or scrapped 
if a unit that has been written down is subsequently sold  the cost associated with the revenue from this unit is reduced to the extent of the write down  resulting in an increase in gross profit 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for income tax reporting purposes  net operating loss carry forwards and other tax credits measured by applying currently enacted tax laws 
valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

table of contents effective july   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainties in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the prospective transition method  which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on accounting for transactions where an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
prior to july   we accounted for stock based compensation awards issued to our employees using the intrinsic value measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or opinion accordingly  we have recorded compensation expense for stock options granted with exercise prices less than the fair value of the underlying common stock at the option grant date 
amortization of deferred stock compensation  resulting from such stock options granted to employees and directors  when the exercise price of our stock options was less than the deemed market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  for the years ended june   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
compensation expense under sfas no 
r for options granted to employees after july   was million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
sfas no 
r requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
sfas no 
r supersedes our previous accounting under apb no 
for periods beginning in fiscal year as of june   the total unrecognized compensation cost  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  related to unvested stock options granted since july  to employees and non employee directors  was million  which is expected to be recognized as an expense over a weighted average period of approximately years 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we estimated the fair value of stock options granted using a black scholes option pricing formula and a single option award approach 
this model requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of our common stock and the expected forfeiture rate 
the fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
the expected term represents the period that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on an analysis of the relevant peer companies post vest termination rates and the exercise factors 
the expected volatility is based on a combination of the implied and historical volatility of our company and the relevant peer group 
in addition  we estimated the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience 
variable interest entities 
we have analyzed our relationship with ablecom and its subsidiaries and we have concluded that ablecom is a variable interest entity as defined by fin no 
r  however  we are not the primary beneficiary of ablecom and  therefore  we do not consolidate ablecom 
in performing our analysis  we considered our explicit arrangements with ablecom including the supplier and distributor arrangements 
also  as a result of the substantial related party relationship between the two companies  we considered whether any implicit arrangements exist that would cause us to protect those related parties interests in ablecom from suffering losses 
we determined that no implicit arrangements exist with ablecom or its shareholders 
such an arrangement would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duty that we have towards our stockholders who do not own shares in ablecom

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risks interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activity are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing the risk 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in money market funds and certificates of deposit 
since our results of operations are not dependent on investments  the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio  and we believe that a change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations 
as of june   our investments were in money market funds  certificates of deposit and auction rate securities 
we had million of indebtedness under our credit facilities as of june   million of indebtedness under our credit facilities as of june  and million of indebtedness under our credit facilities as of june  the annual interest rate on our credit facilities is based on various indexes as defined in the loan agreements 
at june   the interest rates ranged from to 
an immediate increase in the index rates would not have a material effect on our interest expense 
liquidity risk as of june   we held approximately million of long term auction rate securities auction rate securities  net of unrealized losses  representing our interest in auction rate preferred shares in a closed end mutual fund invested in municipal securities and auction rate student loans guaranteed by the federal family education loan program ffelp  such auction rate securities were rated aaa at june  these auction rate preferred shares have no stated maturity date and stated maturity dates for these auction rate student loans range from to during february  the auctions for these auction rate securities began to fail to obtain sufficient bids to establish a clearing rate and were not saleable in the auction  thereby losing the short term liquidity previously provided by the auction process 
as a result  the auction rate securities have been classified as non current investments available for sale as of june  and we recorded an unrealized loss of  
table of contents although we have the financial ability and intent to hold our investments in auction rate securities until successful auctions occur  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the preferred shares are redeemed  these investments are not currently liquid and in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal 
there can be no assurances that these investments will be settled in the short term or that they will not become other than temporarily impaired subsequent to june   as the market for these investments is presently uncertain

we may be required to record impairment charges in periods subsequent to june  with respect to these securities and  if a liquid market does not develop for these investments  we could be required to hold them to maturity 
foreign currency risk to date  our international customer agreements have been denominated solely in us dollars  and accordingly  we have not been exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from customer agreements  and do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  the functional currency of our operations in netherlands and taiwan is the us dollar and our local accounts are maintained in the local currency in the netherlands and taiwan  respectively  and thus we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with re measurement to us dollars 
such fluctuations have not been significant historically 
for example  foreign exchange gain or loss for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively
