item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in item herein 
management is of the opinion that inflation and changing prices  including foreign exchange fluctuations  will have little  if any  effect on our consolidated financial position or results of our operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and estimates involve the use of complicated processes  assumptions  estimates and or judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the consolidated financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors and have identified the following critical accounting policies for the current fiscal year 
principles of consolidation we consolidate entities when we have the ability to control the operating and financial decisions and policies of that entity and record the portion we do not own as minority interest 
the determination of our ability to control or exert significant influence over an entity involves the use of judgment 
we apply the equity method of accounting where we can exert significant influence over  but do not control  the policies and decisions of an entity 
we use the cost method of accounting where we are unable to exert significant influence over the entity 
change in fiscal year on june   we changed our fiscal year to end on the last sunday in april rather than march this fiscal year creates more comparability of our quarterly operations  by generally having an equal number of weeks and weekend days in each fiscal quarter 
periodically  this system necessitates a week year 
fiscal year was a week year which commenced on april  and ended on april  references in this discussion to fiscal years  and represent the twelve months ended april   april  and april   respectively 
equity method of accounting our investments in rci  buena vista development and route are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and our previous investments in ic bh  american racing  and sunrise were accounted for using the equity method of accounting because the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investees 
significant influence is generally deemed to exist where we have an ownership interest in the investee of between and  although other factors such as the degree of ultimate control  representation on the investee s board of directors or similar oversight body are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate 
we record our equity in the income or losses of our investees using the same reporting periods as presented  except we report our equity in income or losses one month in arrears for rci and american racing which have a calendar fiscal year  and one month in arrears for buena vista development and sunrise which have a fiscal year end of march 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded for allocated earnings or losses of our equity investments that are not currently reportable or deductible for federal income tax purposes 
we utilized the equity method of accounting for our interest in route casinos because the operating activities of the joint venture were controlled by the minority venturer 
we were involved in legal proceedings with the minority venturer in route casinos in which the minority venturer asserted that the operating agreement governing the venture is void and unenforceable 
we assessed whether this circumstance indicated utilization of the cost method of accounting for this investment was appropriate and concluded that the equity method best reflected the underlying nature of our investment 
the operating agreement provided that all material decisions of the joint venture were made by the members  including us  on a unanimous basis 
we believed the operating agreement to be binding and enforceable on the venture and our joint venture partner and  therefore  can be concluded that we had significant influence over the affairs of the venture 
we also believe that we were able to reasonably estimate the revenues and expenses of the venture through our second quarter of fiscal year to the extent necessary to apply the equity method of accounting  as described in more detail below under the heading use of estimates 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results can  and often do  differ from those estimates 
through the second fiscal quarter of  we estimated our share of operational activities of route casinos and recorded such amounts using the equity method of accounting see equity method of accounting because we did not receive revenue and expense information from the venture as a consequence of previous litigation 
effective october   we discontinued the recording of any estimated earnings due to the sale and the termination of the equipment leases 
the estimated revenues recorded prior to october  are based on published net win numbers provided by the route casino to the state of new mexico gaming control board for the  gaming devices leased to the casino by route casinos 
estimated expenses are comprised of debt service payments on the  gaming devices supplied to the casino  the supply of parts for the repair of these gaming devices  and a monthly overhead fee to the other member of the route casinos  that was initially agreed to by us and the other member 
the direct expenses related to the debt service of the gaming devices and the other member s overhead are stable costs with little variable activity 
we believe the net profits determined from the estimated revenues and expenses are reasonable  however  actual financial results and the ultimate conclusion of the litigation may vary materially and adversely from our estimates 
capitalized development costs we capitalize certain third party legal  professional  and other miscellaneous fees directly related to the procurement  evaluation and establishment of contracts for development projects 
development costs are recorded on the cost basis and are amortized over the estimated economic term of the contract 
we review each project on a quarterly basis to assess whether any changes to our estimates are appropriate 
if accumulated costs of a specific project exceed the net realizable value of such project or the project is abandoned  the costs are charged to earnings 
we amortized capitalized development costs of dry creek casino dcc  over the contractual five year term of the credit enhancement fee contract 
each quarter  we recognized as expense a percentage of our capitalized development costs determined by dividing actual credit enhancement fees received for the quarter by estimated credit enhancement fees to be received over the five year term of the contract 
we believed this method was appropriate because it matched income and expenses over the term of the contract 
we also reviewed estimated credit enhancement fees to be received over the remaining term of the contract on a quarterly basis to assess whether any changes to our estimates were appropriate 
on january   the river rock entertainment authority rrea exercised a buy out option contained in the development agreement with dcc 
pursuant to the buy out option  rrea had the option to pay equal monthly installments beginning february  on march  rrea and the members of dcc agreed to a cash settlement of the buy out option of  in lieu of the monthly installments 
the remaining balance of unamortized capitalized costs was written off during the fourth quarter of fiscal in conjunction with the buy out 
goodwill and other intangibles in connection with our acquisition of the colorado grande casino on april   we have goodwill with an indefinite useful life of million 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of our goodwill below its carrying value 
we completed an impairment test as required under sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that the goodwill was not impaired 
for properties with goodwill with indefinite lives  this test requires the comparison of the implied fair value of each property to its carrying value 
the implied fair value includes estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
changes in estimates or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results 
asset and investment impairments we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  to account for asset and investment impairments 
under these standards  we evaluate an asset or investment for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recovered 
these events include market declines that are believed to be other than temporary  changes in the manner in which we intend to use a long lived asset  decisions to sell an asset or investment and adverse changes in the legal or business environment such as adverse actions by regulators 
when an event occurs  we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying value based on either i the long lived asset s ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis or ii the fair value of our investment in unconsolidated affiliates 
if an impairment is indicated or if we decide to exit or sell a long lived asset or group of assets  we adjust the carrying value of these assets downward  if necessary  to their estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
our fair value estimates are generally based on market data obtained through the sales process or an analysis of expected discounted cash flows 
the magnitude of any impairments are impacted by a number of factors  including the nature of the assets to be sold and our established time frame for completing the sales  among other factors 
we also reclassify the asset or assets as either held for sale or as discontinued operations  depending on  among other criteria  whether we will have any continuing involvement in the cash flows of those assets after they are sold 
based upon this policy we reduced our investment in sunrise land minerals corporation sunrise by  reduced a note receivable and related accrued interest from big city capital by million and wrote off million of notes receivable  related accrued interest and our equity investment in the la jolla gaming development project as of april  in fiscal year we reduced our investment in sunrise by allowance for doubtful accounts we establish provisions for losses on accounts and notes receivable if we determine that we will not collect all or part of the outstanding balance 
we regularly review collectibility and establish or adjust our allowance as necessary using the specific identification method 
we make advances to indian tribes and other third parties under executed promissory notes for project costs related to the development of gaming and entertainment properties 
due diligence is conducted by our management with the assistance of legal counsel prior to entering into arrangements with indian tribes and other third parties to provide financing in connection with their efforts to secure and develop the properties 
repayment terms are largely dependent upon the operating performance of each opportunity for which the funds have been loaned 
interest income is not accrued until it is reasonably assured that the project will be completed and that there will be sufficient profits from the facility to cover the interest to be earned under the respective note 
if projected cash flows are not sufficient to recover amounts due  the note is evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  to determine the appropriate discount to be recorded on the note for it to be considered a performing loan 
if the note is performing  interest is recorded using the effective interest method based on the value of the discounted note balance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we review on a quarterly basis each of our notes receivable to evaluate whether the collection of such note receivable is still probable 
in our analysis  we review the economic feasibility and the current financial  legislative and development status of the project 
if our analysis indicates that the project is no longer economically feasible then the note receivable would be written down to its estimated fair value 
revenue recognition we record revenues from credit enhancement fees  interest on notes receivable and royalties on the accrual basis as earned 
the dates on which payments are collected may vary depending upon the term of the contracts or note receivable agreements 
interest income related to notes receivable is recorded when earned and its collectibility is reasonably certain 
for certain notes receivable related to indian gaming projects  interest income is not accrued until it is reasonably assured that the project will be completed and that there will be sufficient profits from the gaming facility to cover the interest to be earned under the respective notes 
if the note is performing  interest is recorded using the effective interest method based on the value of the discounted note balance 
the retail value of food and beverage and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and deducted as promotional allowances 
net revenues do not include the retail amount of food  beverage and other items provided gratuitously to customers 
the company records the redemption of coupons and points for cash as a reduction of revenue 
these amounts are included in promotional allowances in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the estimated cost of providing such complimentary services that is included in casino expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations was as follows fiscal year ended april  fiscal year ended april  fiscal year ended april  food and beverage other total cost of complimentary services income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the use of an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences  using currently enacted tax laws  attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we record current income taxes based on our current taxable income  and we provide for deferred income taxes to reflect estimated future tax payments and receipts 
we account for tax credits under the flow through method  which reduces the provision for income taxes in the year the tax credits first become available 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  based on our estimates  it is more likely than not that a portion of those assets will not be realized in a future period 
the estimates utilized in recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision  either up or down  in future periods based on new facts or circumstances 
accrued litigation liability we assess our exposure to loss contingencies including legal matters 
if the potential loss is justified to be probable and estimable  we will provide for the exposure 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from management s estimate  operating results could be impacted 
as of april   we did not record any accrued litigation liability

we have had discussions with various parties who are interested in acquiring the pizza huts owned by rci 
on july   we received a non binding letter of interest to acquire the shares of international restaurants of brazil  a wholly owned subsidiary of rci 
our plan is to divest of such assets and use the proceeds to pay operating expenses or debt or  reinvest the funds into acquisition opportunities where we will have a majority equity position and long term management contracts 
on april   excluding restricted cash of million  we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the restricted cash is the project fund referred to above 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will have adequate availability of cash resources to satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business 
we have made  and are in the process of making  arrangements to ensure that we have sufficient working capital to fund our obligations as they come due 
these potential funding transactions include divesting of non core assets and obtaining long term financing 
we believe that some or all of these sources of funds will be funded in a timely manner and will provide sufficient working capital for us to meet our obligations as they come due  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in divesting of the non core assets or achieving the desired level of working capital at terms that are favorable to us 
should cash resources not be sufficient to meet our current obligations as they come due  repay or refinance our long term debt due on june  and  acquire operations that generate positive cash flow  we would be required to curtail our activities and grow at a pace that cash resources could support which may require a restructuring of our debt or selling core assets of the company 
indebtedness effective march   we entered into a million loan agreement with our lender that replaced the million credit facility with the same lender 
the principal bears interest at per annum and has a maturity date of june  the loan is secured by substantially all of our assets
