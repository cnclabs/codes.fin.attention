in addition to the historical information contained in this document  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  made pursuant to section e of the exchange act  that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements 
factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in item a risk factors and elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
preparation of financial statements and use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  investments  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  bad debts  income taxes  pensions  warranties  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of loss have passed  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point 
in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination  acceptance or cash payment  we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 
our equipment includes embedded software which is considered incidental to the product 
revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point  provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications  which are generally conducted prior to shipment 
where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 
for multiple element arrangements we defer the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract 
we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance  which represents deferred profit 
for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit  the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control 
fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
our post shipment obligations include installation  training services  one year standard warranties  and extended warranties 
installation does not alter the product capabilities  does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors 
installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter 
training services are optional and do not affect the customer s ability to use the product 
we defer revenue for the fair value of installation and training 
extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized 
we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue 
service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
we generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 
for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product  revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements  revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists for such elements 
in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement  all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered 
vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 
for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs 
these arrangements require significant production  modification or customization 
in all cases  changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
with respect to contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured  generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 
inventories inventories  which include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value 
we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such write downs or write offs are identified through the quarterly review process 
the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses 
our inventory balance at december  was million  net of write downs to net realizable value of million 
equity incentive and stock purchase plans effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provision of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the first quarter of fiscal includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   and is calculated based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provision of sfas r 
as required by sfas r  we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stock based compensation awards expected to vest 
the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of sfas r was not material 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we recognized stock based compensation expense in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab regarding the sec s interpretation of sfas r and the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
we have applied provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
see note b accounting policies and note o stock based compensation in notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
on may   our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding  unvested out of the money stock options awarded to employees  officers and other eligible participants under our various stock option plans in effect at that time 
the stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of  the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on may  and ranged in exercise price from to per share 
as a result of the vesting acceleration  options to purchase approximately million shares became exercisable immediately and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under sfas r by approximately million in the aggregate on a pre tax basis over fiscal years  and income taxes on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance 
as a result of its review undertaken at december   we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions  most notably the united states 
due to the continued uncertainty of realization  we maintained our valuation allowance at december  and this valuation allowance may reverse at some time in the future if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we continue to monitor the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
any reversal of the valuation allowance will result in an increase in our net income  but not to the full extent of the reversal in the quarter in which reversal of the tax asset valuation allowance is made 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks 
we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess

bookings our net orders for our two reportable segments for  and are as follows dollar change dollar change in millions semiconductor test systems test group the semiconductor test business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for test equipment  which historically has been highly cyclical 
the semiconductor test bookings decrease of million or from to was driven by less demand across a wide range of end markets  applications and geographies  as soc device units grew at a lower rate in than in this decrease was lessened by our semiconductor test increase in soc market share during by approximately to points 
the increase of million or in semiconductor test bookings from to was attributed to increased demand across a wide range of markets  as customers invested in soc test equipment  principally in the first half of during  the flex family of testers moved into mainstream production and  along with the j platform  contributed to almost all of the growth experienced 
we also saw a customer shift in orders from to with subcontractors making up a larger percentage of orders 
the systems test group s decrease of million or in orders from to was due to decreases in each business unit 
diagnostic solutions orders are program related and have significant fluctuations 
bookings were down due to a large program rollout in for the vehicle measurement module product line 
mil aero test bookings are also often program related and bookings decreased in compared to  as a significant military program concluded during commercial board test bookings decreased in due to a contraction in the size of the ict market 
the systems test group s increase of million or in orders from to was primarily driven by demand in the mil aero test business due to the cyclical nature of the mil aero test program buys  offset slightly by a decrease in diagnostic solutions 
our order cancellations and backlog adjustments for our two reportable segments for the last three years are as follows in millions semiconductor test systems test group customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice  subject to possible cancellation penalties 
in and  there were no significant cancellation penalties received 
due to possible changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period 
delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows united states south east asia europe singapore japan taiwan rest of the world for the past three years  our backlog of unfilled orders for our two reportable segments is as follows in millions semiconductor test systems test group revenue our net revenue for our two reportable segments for  and is as follows dollar change dollar change in millions semiconductor test systems test group semiconductor test decrease in revenue of million or from to is due to soc device units growing at a lower rate in compared to this decrease was lessened by our semiconductor test increase in soc market share during by approximately to points 
this resulted in decreased demand across a wide range of end markets  applications and geographies 
semiconductor test revenue increase of million or from to can be attributed to increased demand across a wide range of markets  as customers invested in soc test equipment 
almost the entire increase in is related to our flex family and j products and is distributed across all regions 
the increase is partially offset by a decrease of certain non flex test systems 
systems test group revenue decrease of million or from to can be attributed to a decrease in diagnostic solutions sales  due to a large program rollout in for the vehicle measurement module product line 
the systems test group increase of million or in revenue from to was driven by a strong increase in diagnostic solutions sales due primarily to the vehicle measurement module product line 
our two reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years semiconductor test systems test group our net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows united states south east asia europe taiwan japan singapore rest of the world our product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows dollar change dollar change in millions product revenue service revenue although product revenue decreased million or in from due to soc device units growing at a lower rate in compared to  service revenue  which is derived from the servicing of our installed base of products  remained relatively flat from service revenue includes maintenance contracts  repairs  extended warranties  parts sales and applications support 
in the past three years  no single customer accounted for more than of consolidated net revenue 
in   and  our three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for  and of consolidated net revenue  respectively 
gross margin dollar point change dollar point change dollars in millions gross margin percent of total revenue the decrease in gross margin of points from to was the result of several factors 
a reduction in semiconductor test sales volume contributed to a decrease of points 
a shift in product mix  primarily related to higher service revenue as a percentage of total revenue  contributed to a decrease of points 
these decreases were offset by an increase of point due to lower semiconductor test inventory provisions in  and an increase of point resulting from lower fixed costs and employee compensation across both segments 
the increase in gross margin of approximately points from to was the result of several factors 
an increase in semiconductor test sales volume contributed points  a shift in product mix within semiconductor test contributed points  an improvement in service margins  primarily within semiconductor test  contributed points  the remaining point increase was due to lower inventory provisions in  as we recorded a million charge for non flex products in the semiconductor test segment in  compared to an million charge for non flex products in the breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows dollar point change dollar point change dollars in millions product gross margin percent of product revenue dollar point change dollar point change dollars in millions service gross margin percent of service revenue we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions 
forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand 
this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory 
obsolete inventory  which represents items for which there is no demand  is fully reserved 
excess inventory  which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters  is written down to estimated net realizable value 
these write offs and write downs consist of raw materials and components 
sales of previously reserved inventory items result in recovery of the related inventory provision  which is recorded in cost of revenues 
during the years ended december   and  we sold inventory previously reserved of million  million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   we recorded inventory provisions of million in cost of revenues of which million was for excess inventory and million was for obsolete inventory 
of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded  million related to semiconductor test and million related to systems test group 
during the year ended december   we recorded inventory provisions of million in cost of revenues of which million was for excess inventory and million was for obsolete inventory 
of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded  million related to semiconductor test including an million provision for the write down of excess non flex inventory and million related to systems test group 
during the year ended december   we recorded inventory provisions of million in cost of revenues of which million was for excess inventory and million was for obsolete inventory 
of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded  million related to semiconductor test including a million provision for the write down of excess non flex inventory and million related to systems test group 
we scrapped million  million  and million of inventory  which had been previously written down or written off  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory that has been previously written down to net realizable value 
as of december  and  we had inventory reserves for amounts which have been written down to net realizable value of million and million  respectively 
of the reserves at december   million  million  million  and million relate to inventory provisions recorded in    and prior to  respectively 
engineering and development change change dollars in millions engineering and development percent of total revenue the increase of million in engineering and development expenses from to was due in part to a million increase in spending related to new products and entry into adjacent markets  primarily in the semiconductor test segment 
this was partially offset by lower variable employee compensation of million 
during and  we reduced our levels of investment in engineering and development spending 
more than of our total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the semiconductor test segment  where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between and million 
during  semiconductor test completed its ultraflex platform development and shifted its focus to increasing the instrumentation set on its flex test platform ultraflex and flex which requires lower levels of engineering and development expenditures 
the decrease of million in engineering and development spending from to consists of the following amounts million decrease due to a reduction in headcount primarily in the us  offset partially by an increase in engineering and development activities in low cost regions  and million decrease due to the completion of certain portions of the flex test platform engineering work 
these decreases were partially offset by the following million increase due to higher variable employee compensation  and million increase due to stock based compensation 
selling and administrative change change dollars in millions selling and administrative percent of total revenue the decrease in selling and administrative spending of million from to consists of the following million decrease due to lower variable employee compensation  and million in lower transition expenses  including the consolidation of facilities in massachusetts and costs associated with the outsourcing of certain information technology functions  both of which occurred in the increase in selling and administrative spending of million from to consists of the following million increase due to higher variable employee compensation  million increase due to transition expenses  including the consolidation of facilities in massachusetts and costs associated with the outsourcing of certain information technology functions  and million increase due to stock based compensation 
these increases from to were partially offset by the following million decrease due to a reduction in headcount  and million decrease in foreign exchange expense 
in process research and development on march   we purchased in process enabling test technology and hired certain engineers from mosaid technologies inc for million  which includes million in fees directly related to the acquisition 
of the purchase price  million has been allocated to in process research and development and therefore has been immediately charged to the statement of operations 
the balance of the purchase price has been allocated to acquired workforce and fixed assets 
this technology was purchased to be used in the development of a new semiconductor test product 
as of the acquisition date  the technology had not reached technical feasibility  had no alternative future use and its fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability  and therefore has been classified as in process research and development 
the technology is unique to the semiconductor test market and requires significant development 
the estimated fair value of the in process technology was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model using an income approach 
estimated cash flows were probability adjusted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the in process technology 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in process project as well as the estimated cash flows to be generated as a result of completing the project development 
restructuring and other  net in response to a downturn in the industry  we initiated restructuring activities in across all segments to reduce costs and redundancies  principally through headcount reductions and facility consolidations 
further actions were initiated in  to a lesser extent in   and additionally  in  and as part of our facility consolidation  we sold certain real estate 
the tables below represent activity related to these actions 
the remaining accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in the accrued employees compensation and withholdings account on the balance sheet 
the remaining accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in the other accrued liabilities account and the long term other accrued liabilities account and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms  the latest of which expires in we expect to pay out approximately million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months

during february  we implemented reduction in force activities across all reportable segments  functions and geographies 
this will include a reduction of approximately employees and a severance charge during the first quarter of of approximately million 
these actions are expected to result in annual savings of approximately million 
interest income and expense change change in millions interest income interest expense the decrease in interest income from to was primarily attributable to lower cash balances due to the stock repurchase activity in the increase in interest income from to was primarily attributable to higher cash balances primarily from the proceeds received from the divestiture of connection systems 
the decrease in interest expense from to was due primarily to the repayment of our senior convertible notes the notes in the decrease in interest expense from to was due primarily to the repayment of notes in the fourth quarter of and repurchases made earlier in the year 
income loss from continuing operations before income taxes change change in millions semiconductor test systems test group corporate total the decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes from to was mainly due to the reduction in revenue in the semiconductor test segment  which was a result of soc device units growing at a lower rate in compared to the increase in corporate from to is primarily related to the elimination of our interest expense due to the repayment of our notes in and gains from sales of real estate which totaled million

capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in capital expenditures decreased by million in compared to  primarily due to a decrease of internally manufactured systems for use in marketing and engineering activities in semiconductor test of approximately million 
the remainder of the decrease was attributable to lower purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment across teradyne 
proceeds from asset disposals were million and million in and  respectively and primarily consist of sales of real estate 
in march  we bought an enabling technology from mosaid technologies inc for a purchase price and related costs totaling million 
investing activities of discontinued operations provided million of cash in included in this balance is the net proceeds we received related to the sale of our broadband test division to tollgrade in august investing activities of discontinued operations provided million of cash in and includes the net proceeds related to our sale of connection systems to amphenol corporation in november financing activities include issuance of our common stock  repurchases of teradyne s common stock as well as repayments of debt 
during and  repayments of long term debt used cash of million and million  respectively 
upon maturity in the fourth quarter of  we paid off the outstanding balance of our outstanding notes  which approximated million aggregate principal 
we also repurchased portions of our outstanding notes in the first and third quarters of  in the first and fourth quarters of and the third quarter of during  and  issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated million  million  and million  respectively 
in july  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program which was completed in october in total  million of common stock was repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
during  we repurchased million shares of common stock for million for an average price per share of 
during  we repurchased million shares of common stock for million for an average price per share of 
in november  our board of directors authorized another stock repurchase program  allowing us to spend an aggregate of million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
as of december   we repurchased million shares of our common stock under this program for an average price per share of 
in october  we issued million principal amount of the notes in a private placement and received net proceeds of million 
the notes were convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which was equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  which was equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
we made annual interest payments of million  paid semi annually  on the notes commencing on april  in august  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of the outstanding notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below of the principal amount 
the board subsequently amended its authorization on october  to authorize repurchases through open market purchases  privately negotiated transaction  auctions  by redemption pursuant to the terms of the governing indenture or other means as determined by our ceo or cfo  at prices below of the principal amount 
the million authorization for repurchase was fully utilized by management during the third quarter of and the first and fourth quarters of to repurchase million  million and million of the notes  respectively 
the decision to repurchase a portion of the notes was based on the fair market value of the notes being below the return we would earn on high grade investment securities 
on january   management was given further authorization by our board to repurchase up to the full million of the principal amount that remained outstanding under the notes through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions and auctions for a price not to exceed of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon 
during  we repurchased notes of million in the first quarter  million in the third quarter  and we repaid the remaining million in the fourth quarter of unrealized losses related to our marketable securities totaled million at december  approximately million of our total investment portfolio of marketable securities were invested in debt securities that have an unrealized loss that has existed for greater than one year as of december  of the securities  million mature within the first quarter of we review our investments to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible impairment 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for anticipated recovery in market value 
based on our review  we have determined that the unrealized losses are temporary 
on january   we completed the acquisition of nextest for an estimated purchase price of million 
this estimated purchase price is net of the cash acquired and includes the fair value of fully vested employee equity instruments and transaction costs 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at december  of million will be sufficient to fund the acquisition of nextest as well as meet the working capital and expenditure needs for at least the foreseeable future 
inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
retirement plans we adopted the funded status recognition provision of sfas effective december  this standard amends sfas    and r 
sfas requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by sfas the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december for other postretirement benefit plans  the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december our pension expense  which includes the us qualified pension plan  certain qualified plans for non us subsidiaries and a supplemental executive defined benefit plan  was approximately million for the year ended december  the largest portion of our pension expense was million for our supplemental executive defined benefit plan 
pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations 
two assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are important elements of pension plan expense and asset liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis 
we evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors  such as retirement age  mortality and turnover periodically  and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 
in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption  we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants  including their review of asset class return expectations 
based on this review  we believe that was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal we will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually  and will adjust the rate as necessary 
the current asset allocation for our us qualified pension plan is invested in equity securities and invested in fixed income securities  which is in accordance with the plan s asset allocation requirements 
our actual asset allocation as of december  was virtually identical to the plan s asset allocation model 
our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 
we base our determination of pension expense or benefit on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized 
as of december   under the us qualified pension plan  we had cumulative gains of approximately million  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on the citigroup pension liability index  which was at december   up from at december  as a result  we selected for our december  discount rate  up from as of december  the duration of the citigroup pension liability index at december  was years  which approximates the duration of the portfolio of pension liabilities 
we estimate that in we will recognize approximately million of pension benefit for the us qualified pension plan 
the pension benefit estimate for is based on a discount rate  and return on plan assets 
future pension expense or benefit will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 
as of december   we had unrecognized pension losses of million  of which million is for the us qualified pension plan 
we performed a sensitivity analysis  which expresses the estimated us qualified pension plan pension expense benefit that would have resulted for the year ended december   if we changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 
discount rate return on plan assets in millions the assets of the us qualified pension plan consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities 
the value of our us qualified pension plan assets has increased from million at december  to million at december  our funding policy is to make contributions to the pension plan in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible 
during  there were no additional contributions made to the us qualified pension plan  and we made million of additional contributions to certain qualified plans for non us subsidiaries 
based upon the non us qualified pension plan funded status as of december   we do not expect to make any contributions to this plan in contributions that will be made in to certain qualified plans for non us subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately million

related party transaction during  paul tufano  a member of our board of directors  was executive vice president  chief financial officer and interim chief executive officer of solectron corporation until it was acquired by flextronics in october mr 
tufano is no longer an employee of solectron or flextronics 
in the ordinary course of business  we have for the last ten years purchased printed circuit board assemblies from solectron  and have also sold in circuit testers to solectron which we refer to as flextronics 
in august  prior to the flextronics acquisition  we expanded our contract with solectron to have it provide additional manufacturing and test services  including areas of final configuration and test for most of our flex family of products 
in the years ended december   and  we purchased million  million and million of printed circuit board assemblies and services from flextronics  respectively 
sales of in circuit testers to flextronics for the years ended december   and were million  million and million respectively 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  was included in accounts payable and million and million  respectively  was included in accounts receivable  representing amounts due to from flextronics

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments  forward currency contracts and accounts receivable 
we maintain cash and marketable securities investments primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities  rated a or higher  which have minimal credit risk 
the overall weighted average portfolio quality will be maintained at a minimum of aa or better at all times 
we place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 
exchange rate risk management we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in the european euro  great britain pound  japanese yen and the taiwan dollar 
these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year 
these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
in addition  we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts 
the gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income 
we do not engage in currency speculation 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of december    and  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk management we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
the principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities 
in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk  a fluctuation in interest rates was assumed 
market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
on these bases  the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is million and million as of december  and  respectively
