item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
management does not believe that inflation or changing prices has had a material effect on our revenues and income from continuing operations 
overview we provide software and related services that allow our clients to more effectively manage their contract based  business to business relationships through the entirety of the contract management lifecycle 
we operate our business in two segments health and life sciences and industry solutions 
the health and life sciences line of business markets and sells our products and services to companies in the life sciences industries  including pharmaceutical and medical product companies  wholesale distributors and managed care organizations 
the industry solutions line of business targets all other industries 
our primary products and services were originally developed to manage complex contract purchasing relationships in the healthcare industry 
our software is currently licensed by of the largest world wide 
table of contents pharmaceutical manufacturers  ranked according to annual pharmaceutical company revenues 
as the depth and breadth of our product suites have expanded  we have added companies in the industry solutions markets to our customer base 
we have generated revenues from both products and services 
recurring revenue  which consists of maintenance  support and hosting fees directly related to our licensed software products  and product subscription revenues  accounted for of net revenues in versus of net revenues in services revenue  which is comprised of professional service fees derived from consulting  installation  business analysis and training services related to our software  accounted for of net revenues in versus of net revenues in license revenue  which consists of non recurring license fees generated from perpetual license agreements  accounted for of net revenues in versus of net revenues in we implemented a number of employee headcount reductions and office downsizings during the period june through march  after which our aggregate quarterly spending on cost of products and services  sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses excluding amortization and noncash stock compensation remained fairly steady ranging from million to million through the first quarter of in early  we began increasing our spending  primarily on research and development and professional services  in order to i accelerate development of future releases of our product offerings in the health and life sciences segment  ii work on resolving defects in one of our software products  as explained in further detail in critical accounting policies revenue recognition in this item  and iii augment staff levels at a number of professional services engagements  primarily in connection with implementations of the software product with performance defects at customer sites 
during the three month period ended march   our spending on research and development as a percentage of revenues reached its highest level in seven years 
however  research and development quarterly expenses have since decreased by  or  in the three month period ended december  our total employee headcount has increased from at march  to at december  on november   we completed a private placement of our securities  issuing  shares of our common stock and common stock purchase warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock 
the per unit price of the private placement offering was  with each unit comprised of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase three tenths of a share of common stock 
the warrants are exercisable at per share until november net proceeds to the company were approximately million  after deducting commissions and other fees 
on december   we completed a private placement of million of senior convertible notes  which bear interest at per annum  payable quarterly in arrears  and will mature on december  the notes are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in the event of a merger or other change in control of the company 
also  the notes can be redeemed at par by the investors on december   or redeemed at par by the company any time beginning on december  net proceeds to the company from the sale of the notes were approximately million  after deducting commissions and other fees 
on february   we completed our purchase of the assets related to the claimright data validation software business from global healthcare exchange llc and global healthcare exchange  inc for million in cash 
of this amount   is being held back pending the achievement of certain defined performance milestones during the first months after the closing 
the company has incurred approximately  in transaction costs in connection with this purchase 
the claimright business is located in ambler  pennsylvania and markets software to pharmaceutical providers for the processing and validating of pharmaceutical claim submissions 
this purchase will provide the company with an established customer base and technology that will enhance its product offering to its pharmaceutical manufacturing clients 

table of contents critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generate revenues from licensing our software and providing professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
software license revenues are attributable to the addition of new customers and the expansion or renewal of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users  licenses of additional software products and license renewals 
we recognize software license fees upon execution of a signed license agreement and delivery of the software to customers  provided there are no significant post delivery obligations  the payment is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
in multiple element arrangements  we allocate a portion of the total fee to professional services  training and maintenance and support services based on the fair value of those elements  which is defined as the price charged when those elements are sold separately 
the residual amount is then allocated to the software license fee 
in cases where we agree to deliver unspecified additional products in the future  the license fee is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement beginning with the delivery of the first product 
in cases where we agree to deliver specified additional products or upgrades in the future  recognition of the entire license fee  including any related maintenance and support fees  is deferred until after the specified additional products or upgrades are delivered and made generally available to all customers 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are deferred until customer acceptance 
in cases where collection is not deemed probable  we recognize the license fee as payments are received 
in cases where significant production or customization is required prior to attaining technological feasibility of the software  license fees are recognized on a percentage of completion basis and are credited to research and development expenses as a funded development arrangement 
after the software attains technological feasibility  recognizable license fees are reported as product revenue 
in  we began to classify our reported net revenues into three revenue categories recurring  services and license revenues after having previously reported our revenues as being either product or service 
recurring revenue consists of i fees generated from the provision of maintenance  support  and hosting services and ii subscription revenues 
services revenue is now comprised of professional service and training fees and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
license revenue consists of non recurring license fees generated from perpetual license agreements 
we offer current and prospective customers the option to enter into a subscription agreement as an alternative to our standard perpetual license contract model 
we believe our subscription offering has expanded the market to customers that find regular subscription payments an easier and more flexible implementation of our software  and subscription arrangements have the potential to provide us with smoother and more predictable revenue growth 
the standard subscription arrangement is presently a fixed fee agreement over three to five years  covering license fees  unspecified new product releases and maintenance and support  generally payable in equal quarterly or annual installments commencing upon execution of the agreement 
prior to  more than half of the executed subscription arrangements included a provision allowing the agreement to convert free of charge to a perpetual license after the completion of the initial term plus any extensions  generally after five years  after which time the customer would have the option of paying for the continuation of maintenance and support 
beginning in  we have generally discontinued including free of charge perpetual conversion provisions in new subscription arrangements 
also included in subscription revenues are license fees generated from perpetual license arrangements with rights to unspecified additional products  which are treated as subscription arrangements for accounting purposes 
for subscription arrangements which include rights to specified products which are not yet generally available to customers  revenue recognition is deferred until all elements of the arrangement including any such specified products have been delivered 
for all other subscription arrangements  we recognize all revenue ratably over the term of the subscription agreement commencing upon delivery of the initial product 
subscription installment amounts that are not yet contractually billable to customers are not reflected in deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents maintenance and customer support fees are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  which is generally twelve months 
when maintenance and support is included in the total license fee  we allocate a portion of the total fee to maintenance and support based upon the price paid by the customer when sold separately  generally as renewals in the second year 
professional service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
if conditions for acceptance exist  professional service revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance 
for fixed fee professional service contracts  we provide for anticipated losses in the period in which the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
training revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
included in training revenues are registration fees received from participants in our annual off site user training conferences 
payments received from customers at the inception of a maintenance period are treated as deferred service revenues and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
payments received from customers in advance of product shipment or revenue recognition are treated as deferred product revenues and recognized when the product is shipped to the customer or when otherwise earned 
subscription arrangements  including a small number of perpetual license arrangements with rights to unspecified additional products that are treated as subscriptions for accounting purposes  represent a significant proportion of our new licenses 
in  of the license contracts minimum value of  that were sold were treated as subscription arrangements for accounting purposes 
in  of the license contracts minimum value of  that were sold were likewise accounted for as subscriptions 
during and  we recognized million and million  respectively  in recurring revenue related to such agreements 
for  we anticipate that subscription arrangements will continue to represent a significant proportion of new license sales 
during the third quarter of  we became aware of certain defects in the then current version of one of our software products  which was first shipped to customers in the fourth quarter of these defects  which were not identified in pre release product testing  affected the performance of the software for a portion of our customers depending on each customer s particular implementation environment and its intended use of the software 
because certain concessions had been made to customers in connection with these defects  we have generally not recognized revenue from sales of this software product and related implementation services since the beginning of the third quarter of  except in those cases in which it was determined that the customer was not likely to be affected by the known  unresolved software defects 
during  new versions of the software were released  but we continued to experience problems with implementations at several customer sites 
in  we released new versions of the software which were designed to resolve known performance defects with minimal additional functionality 
during the quarters ended june and september   we successfully completed implementations of the newest version of this software at multiple customer sites and made progress with other customer implementations  and accordingly have begun recognizing revenue from this software on a limited basis 
however  we are continuing to defer all recurring  services and license revenue in connection with i implementations of this software program that are not yet complete  and ii any customers for which a concession is probable and an agreement formalizing a concession amount has not been executed 
as of december  and  we have reversed and deferred cumulative amounts of million and  respectively  of otherwise recognizable product and service revenue  based in part on our estimate of the fair value of concessions to be made until the remaining defect is resolved  and partly on our determination that license fees were not fixed and determinable because of the possibility of future concessions 
also  see the risk factor entitled we cannot guarantee that our deferred revenue will be recognized as planned in item a of this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
revised fas r  share based payment 
under fas r  we measure and record the compensation 
table of contents cost of employee and director services received in exchange for stock option grants and other equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
the values of the portions of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest are recognized as expense over the requisite service periods 
we account for stock options and awards granted to non employees other than directors using the fair value method 
we adopted fas r using the modified prospective method  pursuant to which our financial statements for prior reporting periods have not been adjusted to include compensation cost calculated under the fair value method 
prior to  we used the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense associated with the grants of stock options or awards to employees and directors 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation associated with such grants and awards was determined as the excess  if any  of the current fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant over the price an employee or director must pay to exercise the award 
under the fair value method  compensation associated with equity awards is determined based on the estimated fair value of the award itself  measured using either current market data or an established option pricing model 
the measurement date for employee and director awards is generally the date of grant 
the measurement date for awards granted to non employees other than directors is generally the date that performance of certain services is complete 
the company s calculations of the fair value of stock option grants  including valuations for pre pro forma calculations  were made using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions  and resulted in the following weighted average grant date fair values of options granted during the years ended december risk free interest rates expected volatility expected dividends expected term in years weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the year the company uses historical volatility of the company s common stock to estimate expected volatility 
beginning in  the expected term of options granted is estimated to be equal to the average of the contractual life of the options and the grant s average vesting period 
the risk free interest rate is derived quarterly from the published us treasury yield curve  based on expected term  in effect as of the last several days of the quarter 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record provisions for doubtful accounts based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and related credit risks 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers the age of the accounts receivables  our historical write off experience  the credit worthiness of customers and the economic conditions of the customers industries and general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
if the assumptions we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future collections  there could be an impact on future reported results of operations 
the provisions for doubtful accounts are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance 
table of contents occurs between annual tests indicating that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test will consist of comparing the cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at the reportable segment level  which is the same as the reporting unit level  using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any  by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in the same manner that goodwill is calculated in a business combination  whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets  with the excess purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities representing the implied fair value of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
if the assumptions we used to estimate fair value of goodwill change  there could be an impact on future reported results of operations 
deferred tax assets a deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes and loss carry forwards based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary items are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
product indemnification our agreements with customers generally include certain provisions obligating us to indemnify the customer against losses  expenses  and liabilities from damages that may be awarded against the customer in the event that our products are found to infringe upon a patent  copyright  trademark  or other proprietary right of a third party 
the agreements generally seek to limit the scope of remedies for such indemnification obligations in a variety of industry standard respects  including our right to replace an infringing product 
to date  we have not had to reimburse any of our customers for any losses related to these indemnification provisions and no claims were outstanding as of december  we do not expect that any significant impact on financial position or the results of operations will result from these indemnification provisions 
research and development costs research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
based on our product development process  technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model 
costs incurred by the company between completion of the working model and the point at which the product is ready for general release have not been material 
as such  all software development costs incurred to date have been expensed as incurred 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  recurring revenue increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period a year earlier  primarily attributable to increases of i million  or  in subscription revenue in the life sciences segment and ii million  or  in maintenance and support revenues in our life sciences segment  which was attributable to continued growth in our maintenance paying  installed customer base in that segment 
as indicated above in this item  subscription arrangements have represented a substantial proportion of license contracts since their introduction in and our recognized subscription revenues have increased significantly during this period 
service revenue increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december  versus million in the current year s amount included million in previously deferred service revenues for work performed in prior reporting periods 
excluding the catch up deferral recognition  service revenues were lower relative to due to a significant decrease in billable consulting work performed in our industry solutions segment 
license revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in as indicated in the table below  the gross value of license contracts sold during increased by versus  due primarily to an increase in the number of license transactions minimum value of  from to license revenue during included million of previously deferred revenues in connection with license agreements sold in prior periods  as compared to no recognition of any such deferred revenues during also  while most of the license transactions executed in both and were either accounted for as subscription arrangements or had conditions such as software acceptance testing which result in deferral of license revenue recognition  the proportion of transactions represented by such deals was smaller in which contributed to the increase in license revenue versus we believe that a significant proportion of future license contracts will likewise be subscription arrangements or will have conditions which mandate deferred revenue recognition 
as a result  in future reporting periods we expect recognized revenues to exclude portions of the license revenue generated from contracts entered into in those periods but also to include larger proportions of revenues from contracts entered into in prior reporting periods

we believe its inclusion can enhance an overall understanding of our past operational performance and also our prospects for the future 
this reconciliation of license revenues is made with the intent of providing a more complete understanding of our sales performance  as opposed to gaap revenue results  which do not include the impact of newly executed subscription agreements and other deferred license arrangements that are material to the ongoing performance of our business 
this information quantifies the various components comprising current license revenue  which in each period consists of the total value of licenses sold in current periods  plus license revenue recorded in the current period from contracts sold in prior periods  less the value of license contracts sold in the current period that is not yet recognizable 
included in the gross value of license contracts sold amounts are license and non cancelable subscription fee obligations that are not currently recognizable as product revenue upon execution of the license agreement because all the requirements for revenue recognition see critical accounting policies revenue recognition in this item are not present  such as the presence of extended payment terms  future software deliverables  or customer acceptance provisions 
the gross value of license contracts sold also includes amounts that are not yet contractually billable to customers  and any such unbilled amounts are not reflected in deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheet 
management uses this information as a basis for planning and forecasting core business activity in future periods and believes it is useful in understanding our results of operations 
also  payouts under our sales compensation and executive bonus plans are based in large part on the gross values of license contracts sold in each period 
the presentation of this additional revenue information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenues reported in accordance with gaap in the united states 
there can be no assurance that the full value of licenses sold and deferred to future reporting periods will ultimately be recognized as total net revenues 
total net revenues derived from our health and life sciences segment increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
essentially all revenue sources contributed to this segment s performance with the principal increases being i million  or 
table of contents in license fees  ii million  or  in subscriptions  iii million  or  in professional services  and iv million  or  in non subscription maintenance and support 
as indicated in the above table  the gross values of license contracts sold in this segment during the year ended december  increased by million  or  versus due primarily to an increase in the number of license transactions 
segment license revenue during the year ended december  included million of previously deferred revenues in connection with license agreements sold in prior periods 
approximately one third of the increase in services revenue was comprised of current year recognition of previously deferred consulting work  with the balance of the increase mostly attributable to higher demand for consulting work in connection with changes in government regulation ie  the deficit reduction act of 
the increase in maintenance and support revenue relative to the prior year was attributable primarily to growth in our installed maintenance paying customer base  particularly in connection with our recent releases of the i many contract management suite for life sciences  and to a lesser extent a non recurring  back maintenance charge to a single customer 
total net revenues derived from the industry solutions segment increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in this increase was attributable to the recognition of million in previously deferred revenues in connection with license agreements and related services sold in prior years 
excluding the catch up deferral recognition  professional services revenues in this segment were lower in versus by million 
as indicated in the above table  the gross value of license contracts sold in this segment during decreased by  or  versus  continuing a trend of declining annual licensing activity that began in  and this trend has been a key contributor to the decline in professional services revenue opportunities 
licensing activity in the industry solutions segment has been negatively affected by product defect issues in one of our key software products see critical accounting policies revenue recognition in this item above and management is uncertain as to when it expects licensing activity in this segment to begin growing 
operating expenses cost of recurring revenue 
cost of recurring revenue consists primarily of payroll and related costs for providing maintenance and support services  and  to a lesser extent  hosting services 
cost of recurring revenue for the year ended december  was unchanged at million versus the year ended december  increases of  in salary and related costs  resulting principally from merit increases and an increase in average headcount of employees  and  in noncash stock compensation was entirely offset by a  decrease in consulting fee expenses and sundry other expense reductions 
as a percentage of recurring revenue  cost of recurring revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   with this decrease being entirely attributable to higher recurring revenue in cost of services revenue 
cost of services revenue consists primarily of payroll and related costs and subcontractor fees for providing implementation  consulting and training services 
cost of services revenue increased by  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase is principally attributable to increases of i  in the cost of consultants  resulting from the need to augment our professional services staff on certain implementation engagements  ii  in salary and related costs  primarily due to annual merit increases  and iii  in noncash stock compensation costs  partially offset by a  decrease in travel expenses 
as a percentage of service revenues  cost of services revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  cost of third party technology 
cost of third party technology  which consists of amounts due to third parties for royalties related to integrated technology  has not been significant historically 
cost of third party technology increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  this increase was attributable to the accelerated amortization of certain prepaid royalty amounts since sales of our products which require payments of royalties to third parties actually decreased from the prior year 

table of contents amortization of other acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our acquisitions amounted to  in the year ended december   which represents a  or  decrease in amortization from the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to the intangible assets in connection with the acquisitions of netreturn  llc and menerva technologies  inc becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related benefits for sales and marketing personnel  commissions for sales personnel  travel costs  recruiting fees  expenses for trade shows and advertising and public relations expenses 
sales and marketing expense increased by  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to a  increase in commission costs  resulting primarily from a increase in the gross value of license contracts sold in versus and to an increase in draw payments instituted as part of a sales staff retention plan

research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs for development personnel and external consulting costs associated with the development and maintenance of our products 
research and development costs  including the costs of developing computer software  are charged to operations as they are incurred 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was principally comprised of increases of i million in consulting costs  ii million in salary and related costs  resulting from merit increases  higher staff levels  and one time severance payments  and iii  in noncash stock compensation costs 
the increases in salary related and consulting costs were mostly attributable to our ramping up resources for the development of next generation products for our health and life sciences segment  which were released in late december as a percentage of total net revenues  research and development expense decreased to in versus in because of the relatively larger increase in net revenues relative to the prior year 
our spending on research and development expenses reached its highest point since our initial public offering in in both absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue during the first quarter of subsequently  spending levels decreased an average of per quarter through the end of  with spending as a percentage of revenues during the fourth quarter of reaching its second lowest level since the first quarter of management expects spending levels on research and development to remain stable through the first half of general and administrative

general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increases of i  in salary and related costs  which was caused by higher executive bonus payments and merit pay increases  and ii  in noncash stock compensation costs  resulting mostly from stock option grants to our chief executive officer 
as a percentage of total net revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  depreciation 
depreciation expense increased by  or  to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  this increase is principally attributable to an increase in the level of furniture  equipment and software additions to million in as compared to annual average additions of  for the years through restructuring and other charges

overall recurring revenues increased by million  or  primarily comprised of increases of i million  or  in subscription revenue in the life sciences segment  i  or  in hosting revenues across both segments and ii  or  in maintenance and support revenues in our life sciences segment  which was attributable to continued growth in our maintenance paying  installed customer base in that segment 
overall services revenues decreased by million  or to million in the year ended december  versus million in this decrease was attributable to a million  or  decrease in professional services revenues in our health and life sciences segment  caused by reduced demand for consulting services in connection with large scale implementation projects 
operating expenses cost of recurring revenue 
cost of recurring revenue increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to increases of i  in salary and related costs  resulting principally from an increase in average headcount of employees  ii  in data center hosting fees  reflecting the increase in demand for hosting services discussed above  and iii  in noncash stock compensation costs  resulting from our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no

as a percentage of recurring revenue  cost of recurring revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  cost of services revenue 
cost of services revenue increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to increases of i million in the cost of consultants  resulting from the need to augment our professional services staff on certain implementation engagements  and ii  in noncash stock compensation costs  resulting from our adoption of fas r  partially offset by a reduction of  in salary and related costs  resulting principally from a decrease in average headcount of employees 
as noted in critical accounting policies revenue recognition in this item  one of our software products has been experiencing performance defects  and consequently we increased outsourced staffing on certain implementation engagements without a corresponding increase in revenue 
largely as a consequence of this increase in nonbillable implementation services  cost of services as a percentage of service revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  cost of third party technology 
cost of third party technology decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to the change in the mix of license transactions  with fewer transactions with high content of third party technology being executed in the current year relative to the year earlier period 

table of contents amortization of other acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our acquisitions amounted to  in the year ended december   which represents a  or  decrease in amortization from the year earlier period

the increase in consulting and salary related costs was largely attributable to our efforts to resolve product defect issues in one of our key software products see critical accounting policies revenue recognition in this item above and was also the result of our ramping up resources for the development of next generation products for our health and life sciences segment 
consequently  research and development expense increased significantly to in versus in as a percentage of total net revenues

in  we entered into several capital lease financing arrangements with different financial institutions in order to finance the purchase of  in computer equipment and related software and services 
in and  the amounts financed in capital lease arrangements amounted to  and  respectively 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  as compared to cash and cash equivalents of million at december  also at december   we had million in convertible notes payable outstanding 
the current and non current restricted cash balances of  and  respectively  at december  represent cash amounts held on deposit as security on two long term real property lease obligations 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities consisted principally of our net loss of million as reduced by non cash items depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million  and a million decrease in deferred revenue  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable and a  increase in accrued expenses 
the million decrease in deferred revenue was primarily attributable to the recognition into revenue during of million in previously deferred license fees see table under results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues in this item  partially offset by a  increase in deferred subscription fees  which is a result of the increased popularity of subscription license arrangements 
the million decrease in accounts receivable was principally attributable to strong collection experience as days sales outstanding decreased significantly from days at december  to days at december  the  increase in accrued expenses was mostly comprised of higher bonus accruals and an increase in sales taxes accrued 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities consisted principally of our net loss of million as reduced by non cash items depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million  partially offset by increases in deferred revenue and accounts payable of million and million  respectively  and a million decrease in accounts receivable 
the increase in deferred revenue is mostly attributable to i a million increase in license fee and services deferrals  resulting from increased prevalence of contractual customer acceptance clauses in license agreements and to the software performance related deferrals noted in critical accounting policies revenue recognition in this item  ii a  increase in deferred subscription fees  which is a result of the increased popularity of subscription license arrangements  and iii a  increase in deferred maintenance and support revenue  which is largely attributable to delayed recognition of maintenance and support renewals for customers with certain rights to future versions of our products 
the increase in accounts payable was largely the result of the timing of payments  the balance at december  being unusually high relative to prior quarters

table of contents net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  as compared to net cash used of  for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and consisted principally of purchases of property and equipment of  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended december   principally comprised of million in proceeds from the private placement issuance of notes payable  as compared to cash provided of million in the year ended december   which consisted primarily of million in net proceeds from a private placement sale of common stock and  in proceeds from warrant and stock option exercises 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents of million will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions for at least the next months 
our future long term capital needs will depend significantly on the rate of growth of our business  our rate of loss  the mix of subscription licensing arrangements versus perpetual licenses sold  possible acquisitions  the timing of expanded product offerings and the success of these offerings if and when they are launched 
accordingly  any projections of future long term cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if our current balance of cash and cash equivalents is insufficient to satisfy our long term liquidity needs  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities to raise funds  and those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
in connection with a sale of stock  our stockholders would experience dilution 
in addition  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
also  our stock price may make it difficult for us to raise additional equity financing 
contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period amounts in s total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations note the long term debt and capital lease obligations amounts in the above table include interest 
the long term debt obligation amounts assume that the notes are not converted to common stock and are held to maturity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without assuming significant risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified investments  consisting primarily of short term investment grade securities 
due to the nature of our investments  we believe there is no material risk exposure 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates  either positive or negative  would not have had a significant effect on either i our cash flows and reported net losses in the years ended december   and  or ii the fair value of our investment portfolio at december  and as of december  and  our cash and cash equivalents consisted entirely of money market investments and short term commercial paper with remaining maturities of days or less when purchased and 
table of contents non interest bearing checking accounts 
investments in marketable debt securities with maturities greater than days and less than one year are classified as held to maturity short term investments and are recorded at amortized cost 
under current investment guidelines  maturities on short term investments are restricted to one year or less 
at december  and  we held no such short term investments 
investments in auction rate securities  with maturities which can be greater than one year but for which interest rates reset in less than days  are classified as available for sale securities and have been stated at fair market value 
at december  and  we held no auction rate certificates  having disposed of all our previous holdings in such investments during as of december  and  our outstanding debt consisted entirely of senior convertible notes of and million  respectively  and capital lease obligations of  and  respectively 
the interest rates on the convertible notes and our various capital lease obligations are fixed  so we are not currently exposed to risk from changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would not have had a significant effect on our annual interest expense 
foreign currency exchange risk we operate in certain foreign locations  where the currency used is not the us dollar 
however  these locations have not been  and are not currently expected to be  significant to our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates have not had a material effect on our business
