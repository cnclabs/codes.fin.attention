critical accounting estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions  impacting the company s reported results of operations and financial position 
certain accounting estimates  however  are considered to be critical in that i they are most important to the depiction of the financial condition and results of operations of the company and ii their application requires management s most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
customer sales and discounts and allowances the company gives allowances and offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers that are accounted for as a reduction of sales 
the company records estimated reductions to sales for price promotion discounts at the time the product purchased by the independent sales distributor is sold to the customer distributor discounts at the time revenue is recognized coupon expense at the estimated redemption rate customer rebates at the time revenue is recognized cooperative advertising at the time the company s obligation to the customer is incurred product returns received from independent sales distributors price promotion discount expense is recorded when the related product being discounted is sold by the independent sales distributor to the customer 
the amount of the price promotion is captured when the independent sales distributor sells product to the customer 
the price promotion discount is based upon actual discounts per case using an approved price promotion calendar 
any increase or decrease in volume may result in variations to price discounts recorded each month 
independent sales distributors receive a purchase discount equal to a percentage of the wholesale price of product sold to customers  adjusted for price promotions and product returns 
direct customers receive a purchase discount equal to a percentage of the wholesale price of product received 
discounts to distributors and customers are based on agreed upon rates  and amounts vary based upon volume 
coupon expense estimates are calculated using the number of coupons dropped to consumers and the estimated redemption percentage 
the estimated redemption percentages are based on data obtained from the company s third party coupon processor  and its experience with similar coupon drops 
upon monthly receipt of the actual coupon redemption report  the coupon expense is updated based upon actual coupon activity as well as changes in the forecasted redemption percentage as estimated by the third party coupon processor 
estimates for customer rebates assume that customers will meet the required quantities to qualify for payment 
if the customers fall above or below the estimate as the year progresses  this could impact the estimate 
cooperative advertising expense is recorded based on the estimated advertising cost of the underlying program 
product returns are recorded as product is returned to the company 
at quarter and year end  an estimated reserve for product returns is recorded based upon sales in the last month of the quarter or year and historical return experience 
actual returns may vary from this estimate 
some customers take unauthorized deductions when they make payments to the company 
unauthorized deductions are taken by customers for various reasons  including  but not limited to missing or damaged product 
it is the company s policy to establish a reserve for each unauthorized deduction at the time it is taken by the customer 
the reserve is maintained until such time as the company can determine the validity of the deduction 
if it is ultimately determined after investigation that a deduction is not valid  the customer is charged back and the reserve is reversed 
since the company obtains updated information on every discount and allowance account each month  the risk that estimates are not properly recorded is generally limited to a percentage of one month s activity 
the average monthly amount of discounts and allowances was approximately million in historically  actual discounts and allowances have not varied significantly from estimates 
total discounts and allowances were of gross sales in this percentage is consistent with prior years and is a significant percentage of gross sales since all price discounts given to both independent sales distributors and third party distributors are reflected as reductions to gross sales 
provision for doubtful accounts the company aggressively pursues collection of accounts receivable balances 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers financial condition and makes quarterly estimates of its ability to collect its accounts receivable balances 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management specifically analyzes accounts receivable trends and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  levels of customer deductions  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a selling  general and administrative expense 
the allowance for doubtful accounts has three components 
the first component is a reserve against all accounts receivable balances based on the last five years of write off experience for the company 
the second component is for specific trade customer accounts receivable balances from customers whose ability to pay is in question  such as customers who file for bankruptcy while they have an outstanding balance due the company 
the third component is a reserve against any breached independent sales distributor accounts receivable balances that are not adequately covered by the independent sales distributor s equity in the route territory 
although the total allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the estimated risk for all customer balances  if any one of our top twenty customers accounts receivable balances became fully uncollectible  it would have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations and would negatively impact cash flow 
long lived asset impairment in accordance with sfas no  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in instances where the carrying amount may not be recoverable  the review for potential impairment utilizes estimates and assumptions of future cash flows directly related to the asset 
cash flow estimates are typically derived from the company s historical experience and internal business plans 
for assets where there is no plan for future use  the review for impairment includes estimates and assumptions of the fair market value of the asset  which is based on the best information available 
the company uses market prices  when available  and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
these assets are recorded at the lower of their book value or market value 
adverse changes in future market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of an affected asset 
for assets which are expected to be disposed of through abandonment before the end of their previously estimated useful life  depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the shortened useful life 
pension and postretirement plans accounting for pensions and postretirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including discount rate  rate of return on plan assets  compensation increases  health care cost increases  and mortality and employee turnover 
a sensitivity analysis for pensions is included in note and a sensitivity analysis for postretirement benefits other than pensions is included in note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
licensed independent actuaries perform these required calculations to determine liability and expense in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in addition  the company may experience significant changes in its pension expense from year to year because of its election in to immediately recognize all pension gains and losses in excess of its pension corridor in the year that they occur 
for comparative purposes  this is relevant because most other public companies use an amortization method that allows recognition of pension gains and losses to be amortized over longer periods of time  up to years 
also  the final determination of the gains and losses that could potentially exceed the corridor is not known until the last day of the year  which makes it difficult to estimate 
the combination of low interest rates and low or negative rates of return on plan assets can cause higher levels of pension expense  conversely  high interest rates and high rates of return on assets could result in higher levels of pension income 
market conditions where interest rates and asset returns move inversely relative to each other  in most instances  cause the company to have pension expense or income within its allowable pension corridor 
actual results may differ from the company s assumptions and may impact the liability and expense amounts reported for pensions and postretirement benefits 
during long term corporate bond rates stayed flat and overall pension asset returns were below the assumption 
in addition  the discount rate increased from at the end of to at the end of further  the other post retirement benefits opeb discount rate increased from to at the end of there were no gains or losses in excess of the pension corridor for or with the implementation of medicare part d in january  the company no longer provides medical benefits for most of its post retirees 
in addition  incumbent retirees pay age based rates for life insurance benefits in excess of as a result of these benefit changes  the projected benefit obligation was remeasured and the company recognized a reduction in its opeb liability of approximately  that will be amortized over future periods 
in  the company recognized the amortization of this liability in a reduction of pre tax opeb of  this is primarily a non cash benefit 
workers compensation expense accounting for workers compensation expense requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including the ultimate severity of injuries  the timeliness of reporting injuries  and health care cost increases 
the company insures for workers compensation liabilities under a large deductible program where losses are incurred by the company up to certain specific and aggregate amounts 
accruals for claims under the large deductible insurance program are recorded as claims are incurred 
the company estimates the liability based on total incurred claims and paid claims  adjusted by loss development factors that account for the development of losses over time 
loss development factors are based on prior loss experience and on the age of incurred claims  and are reviewed by a third party claim loss specialist 
the company s estimated liability is the difference between the amounts we expect to pay and the amounts we have already paid for those years  adjusted for the limits on the aggregate amounts and discounted to present value 
the company evaluates the estimated liability on a continuing basis and adjusts it accordingly 
included in the estimate of liability is an estimate for expected changes in inflation and health care costs 
if there were to be an excessive number of workers compensation claims in a given accounting period and these actual results varied from the company s assumptions  these could have a material impact on our cash flow and consolidated statement of operations 
income tax valuation during the year  the company records income tax expense and liabilities based on estimates of book and tax income  and current tax rates 
these estimates could vary in the future due to uncertainties in company profits  new laws  new interpretations of existing laws  and rulings by taxing authorities 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
the company has recorded a deferred income tax asset for the benefit of federal and state income tax loss carryforwards nols 
these carryforwards expire in varying amounts between and realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
however  the amount realized could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are not achieved

gross margin for fiscal  gross margin declined percentage points to of net sales from of net sales in fiscal increased ingredient and packaging costs accounted for percentage points of decline  while incremental depreciation resulting from the change in useful lives of certain assets at the company s philadelphia bakery accounted for approximately percentage points of decline

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses declined by  or to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal this reduction was primarily attributable to lower employee related costs due in part to changes in the company s vacation plans  which resulted in a benefit of approximately million  as well as million in benefit from state franchise tax credits that were generated by certain of the company s charitable contributions in and prior years 
depreciation depreciation expense increased to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal the increase was due to a change in the useful lives of certain assets at the philadelphia operation which will not be relocated to the new facility

recent accounting statements in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertain tax positions  an interpretation of fas fin  which clarifies the criteria for recognition and measurement of benefits from uncertain tax positions 
under fin  an entity should recognize a tax benefit when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position would be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
the amount to be recognized should be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
furthermore  any change in the recognition  derecognition or measurement of a tax position should be recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs
