racal for uk million or million  subject to certain governmental approvals an customary closing conditions 
racal develops and manufactures high technology ruggedized personal communication equipment for the defense and avionics market segment 
racal will be included in our avionics controls segment 
income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share in fiscal income from continuing operations in fiscal included a million  net of tax  or per diluted share  insurance recovery 
in fiscal  avionics controls performance was robust compared to the prior year period  reflecting the effect of a stronger us dollar compared to the canadian dollar and solid results across all operating units 
results in sensors systems improved and advanced materials earnings reflected strong sales and earnings in fiscal over the prior year period  offset by the insurance recovery recorded in fiscal interest expense decreased million over the prior year period  reflecting reduced borrowings 
income from continuing operations for fiscal reflected an effective tax rate of compared to for the prior year period 
net earnings for fiscal were million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share in fiscal results of continuing operations fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal increased over the prior year reflecting incremental sales from the cmc acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal  strong sales across all segments and a week year in fiscal compared to a week year in fiscal sales by segment were as follows dollars in thousands increase decrease from prior year avionics controls sensors systems advanced materials total the increase in avionics controls reflected incremental sales from the cmc acquisition and higher sales of cockpit controls and medical equipment devices from new oem programs as well as strong after market sales 
comparing the fourth fiscal quarter of to the prior year period  avionics controls sales increased  reflecting increased sales of cockpit avionics  controls and medical control panels 
the increase in sensors systems principally reflected growth in oem programs for power distribution devices and strong after market sales of temperature and pressure sensors  as well as the effect of exchange rates 
sales through much of fiscal reflected a stronger euro relative to the us dollar 
the average exchange rate for the euro increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this relationship changed significantly in the fourth fiscal quarter of when the spot rate declined from at august   to at october  comparing the fourth fiscal quarter of to the prior year period  sensors systems sales increased  principally reflecting increased sales of power distribution devices 
the increase in advanced materials reflected strong sales across the segment and reflected higher sales at our thermally engineered components and elastomer operations due to increased demand from commercial aviation customers 
additionally  sales of combustible ordnance and flare countermeasure devices at our uk operations were strong in fiscal these increases were partially offset by lower sales of flare countermeasure devices at our us operations 
comparing the fourth quarter of fiscal to the prior year period  advanced materials sales increased  reflecting strong sales of combustible ordnance and flare countermeasure devices 
sales to foreign customers  including export sales by domestic operations  totaled million and million  and accounted for and of our sales for fiscal and  respectively 
overall  gross margin as a percentage of sales was and in fiscal and  respectively 
avionics controls segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively  principally reflecting the effect of exchange rates on our canadian operations in the fourth fiscal quarter of the us dollar strengthened against the canadian dollar from at the end of our third fiscal quarter of to at the end of our fourth fiscal quarter 
changes in exchange rates mainly affected cmc s us dollar denominated accounts receivable  foreign exchange contracts and backlog 
the impact of exchange rates on us dollar denominated accounts receivable  backlog and forward exchange contracts favorably impacted gross margin in the fourth fiscal quarter of by approximately million compared to a million loss in the prior year period 
the effect of foreign exchange on cmc s gross margin was a gain of approximately million in fiscal and a loss in fiscal of approximately million 
approximately million of cmc s us dollar denominated backlog at october  is covered by forward exchange contracts  which are accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
approximately million of backlog covered by forward exchange contracts were executed before the strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar 
accordingly  the strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar will not be realized on us dollar denominated sales covered by forward contracts executed before the dollar began to strengthen against the canadian dollar 
cmc s gross margins in fiscal were also enhanced by an improved recovery of fixed overhead due to higher sales volumes  cost reductions and productivity improvements 
the increase in cmc s gross margin was partially offset by a million million  net of tax  or per diluted share estimate to complete adjustment for long term contracts recorded in the third fiscal quarter of the adjustment was principally due to higher engineering costs as a result of resource constraints  increased scope and additional certification requirements to develop upgraded commercial aviation flight management systems 
excluding cmc  avionics controls gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively  reflecting increased after market spares sales and pricing strength on certain cockpit control devices  partially offset by an increase in excess and obsolete inventory reserves and a million and a million unfavorable estimate to complete adjustment on certain firm fixed price long term contracts for the development and manufacture of secure military communications products in fiscal and  respectively 
sensors systems segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
gross margins mainly reflected strong after market sales  partially offset by the effect of a weaker us dollar compared with the euro on us denominated sales and euro denominated cost of sales for most of fiscal the impact of exchange rates on forward foreign exchange contracts impacted gross margin at our euro based operations by a gain of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
forward exchange contracts at our non us sensor systems units are principally accounted for as a cash flow hedge and  accordingly  unrealized gains or losses are recognized upon settlement of the forward exchange contract 
advanced materials segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in advanced materials gross margin was due to increased gross margins at our combustible ordnance and uk flare operations as well as our elastomer and thermally engineered component operations resulting from pricing strength on certain products and an improved recovery of overhead due to higher product sales and a more favorable mix of product shipments 
selling  general and administrative expenses which include corporate expenses increased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses mainly reflected incremental selling  general and administrative expenses from the cmc acquisition  which was acquired in march  higher incentive compensation expense  and the effect of exchange rates at our non us operations 
the effect of exchange rates on cash held by the corporate office and certain intercompany advances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar resulted in an exchange loss of million in fiscal compared to a million gain in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in fiscal and  respectively 
research  development and related engineering spending increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in research  development and engineering principally reflected incremental spending from the cmc acquisition and increased spending on the development of the integrated cockpit system for the t b military trainer 
research  development and engineering expense in fiscal and is net of million and million  respectively  in government assistance 
cmc is currently negotiating a new government assistance arrangement with canada  which will likely be accounted for as a loan rather than a reduction in research  development and related engineering expense 
segment earnings which exclude corporate expenses and other income and expense increased during fiscal to million compared to million in the prior year 
segment earnings as a percent of sales were and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in segment earnings as a percent of sales from fiscal reflects business insurance recoveries of million recorded in fiscal avionics controls segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  reflecting strong earnings from our avionics  cockpit control and medical equipment devices operations  partially offset by the shipment in fiscal of acquired inventory of cmc  which was valued at fair value at acquisition 
in addition  cmc s earnings in fiscal were favorably affected by the effect of a stronger us dollar compared with the canadian dollar  particularly in the fourth quarter  which resulted in a foreign currency transaction gain on us dollar denominated accounts receivable and backlog in the fourth quarter of fiscal avionics controls earnings were impacted by significant research and development expenses  principally related to the development of the t b at cmc  and a gross profit reduction of million due to an estimate to complete adjustment on long term contracts accounted for under sop compared to a million adjustment in the prior year period 
the prior period was also impacted by million in contract overruns and additional research and development expense at a small unit which manufactures precision gears and data concentrators 
cmc s results of operations are not in accordance with our expectations since acquisition 
as indicated above  cmc s results of operations were impacted by the weak us dollar relative to the canadian dollar for most of the period since our acquisition of the business and higher than expected research and development expenses related to the t b development 
recognizing the impact of these issues  management is focused on a broad array of initiatives designed to improve cmc s results of operations 
sensors systems segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal the increase in sensors systems earnings reflected strong results across all operations helped by increased sales from new oem programs  as well as strong after market sales 
sensors systems segment earnings in the fourth quarter for fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
the decrease in segment earnings principally reflected lower gross margin due to start up costs of a manufacturing operation in a low cost country  a less favorable product mix and the purchase of a technology license  which was recorded as research and development expense 
certain temperature  pressure  and speed sensors are not achieving profit margins the company projects for the long term 
management is focused on improving its operational efficiency and negotiating with customers to increase pricing where price increases can be justified 
the impact of exchange rates on us dollar denominated accounts receivable and foreign exchange contracts impacted sensors systems earnings by a gain of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
advanced materials segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  principally reflecting million in business interruption insurance recoveries in fiscal the impact of exchange rates on us dollar denominated accounts receivable and forward foreign exchange contracts impacted advanced material earnings at our uk operations by a loss of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
on june   an explosion occurred at the company s wallop facility  which resulted in one fatality and several minor injuries 
the incident destroyed an oven complex for the production of advanced flares and significantly damaged a portion of the facility 
the advanced flare facility has been closed due to the requirements of the health and safety executive hse to review the cause of the accident  but normal operations are continuing at unaffected portions of the facility 
the hse investigation will not be completed until the coroner s inquest is filed 
although it is not possible to determine the results of the hse investigation or how the coroner will rule  management does not expect to be found in breach of the health and safety at work act related to the accident and  accordingly  no amounts have been recorded for any potential fines that may be assessed by the hse 
the construction of the new flare facility is expected to be completed and in full production  following customary start up and commissioning activities  late in fiscal excluding the business insurance recovery  results of operations at our uk flare countermeasure operation improved by million over fiscal this trend is expected to continue  however  poor product mix in fiscal resulted in our us and us flare countermeasure operations recording an operating loss 
accordingly  management is focused on completing the advanced flare facility in the uk  developing more advanced flares with higher gross margins and improving margins on existing products 
the decrease in earnings described above was partially offset by strong earnings from our thermally engineered components  elastomer and combustible ordnance operations 
interest expense decreased to million during fiscal compared with million in the prior year  reflecting reduced borrowings 
non operating expenses included a million gain from a terminated interest rate swap on our million term loan  resulting from a million or million repayment 
non operating expenses in fiscal included a million write off of debt issuance costs as a result of the prepayment of our million us term loan 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared with in fiscal the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate  as both years benefited from various tax credits and certain foreign interest expense deductions 
in addition  in fiscal  we recognized million in discrete tax benefits 
the million in discrete tax adjustments were the result of five items 
the first item was the settlement of an examination of the us income tax returns for fiscal years through  which resulted in a million reduction of previously estimated income tax liabilities 
the second item was the enactment of tax laws reducing the canadian statutory corporate income tax rate  which resulted in a million net reduction of deferred income tax liabilities 
the third item was the accrual of million of tax reserves and interest related to the finalization of cmc s fin analysis 
the fourth item was recording million of tax expense associated with the reconciliation of fiscal s us income tax return provision for income taxes 
the fifth item was the recording of million of tax benefits associated with the extension of the us research experimentation tax credit 
in fiscal  we recognized million in net discrete tax benefits 
the million in net discrete tax benefits were the result of three items 
the first item was the enactment of tax laws reducing uk  canadian  and german statutory corporate income tax rates which resulted in a million net reduction in deferred income tax liabilities 
the second item was the retroactive extension of the us research experimentation tax credit  which resulted in a million tax benefit 
the third item was recording million of additional income tax resulting from the reconciliation of fiscal s us and foreign income tax returns to the provisions for income taxes

the senior notes are due march  and bear an interest rate of 
the senior notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the company 
the senior notes are guaranteed  jointly and severally on a senior basis  by all the existing and future domestic subsidiaries of the company unless designated as an unrestricted subsidiary  and those foreign subsidiaries that executed related subsidiary guarantees under the indenture covering the senior notes 
the senior notes are subject to redemption at the option of the company at any time prior to march  at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued interest to the date of redemption and a make whole provision 
in addition  before march  the company may redeem up to of the principal amount at plus accrued interest with proceeds of one or more public equity offerings

in addition  the senior subordinated notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future senior debt and other liabilities including trade payables of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
the senior subordinated notes are guaranteed  jointly and severally  by all the existing and future domestic subsidiaries of the company unless designated as an unrestricted subsidiary under the indenture covering the senior subordinated notes 
the senior subordinated notes are subject to redemption at the option of the company  in whole or in part  on or after june   at redemption prices starting at of the principal amount plus accrued interest during the period beginning june  and declining annually to of principal and accrued interest on june  in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on million of our senior subordinated notes due in the swap agreement exchanged the fixed interest rate for a variable interest rate on million of the million principal amount outstanding 
on february   we borrowed uk million  or approximately million  under the gbp term loan facility 
we used the proceeds from the loan as working capital for our uk operations and to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the principal amount of the loan is payable quarterly commencing on march  through the termination date of november   according to a payment schedule by which of the principal amount is paid in each quarter of  in each quarter of  in each quarter of and in each quarter of the loan accrues interest at a variable rate based on the british bankers association interest settlement rate for deposits in uk pounds plus an additional margin amount that ranges from to depending upon the company s leverage ratio 
as of october   the interest rate on the term loan was 
during fiscal we paid down million  or million  on the gbp million term loan and terminated an interest rate swap for a gain of million 
the interest rate swap exchanged the variable interest rate for a fixed interest rate of plus an additional margin amount determined by reference to our leverage ratio 
on march   we acquired cmc for approximately million in cash  including acquisition costs 
the acquisition was financed in part with the proceeds of the million senior notes due march  in addition  on march   we amended our credit agreement to increase the existing revolving credit facility to million and to provide an additional million us term loan facility 
on march   we borrowed million under the revolving credit facility and million under the us term loan facility to pay a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of cmc 
on october   we completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of common stock  generating net proceeds of million 
proceeds from the offering were used to pay off our million us term loan facility and pay down our revolving credit facility 
we wrote off million in debt issuance costs related to the million term loan in fiscal as a result of its pay off 
in fiscal  we entered into a land and building lease for a  square foot manufacturing facility to be constructed in fiscal for our korry electronics operation 
the land lease has a fixed term of years and lease payments began in fiscal the land lease is accounted for as an operating lease 
the building lease has a fixed term of years and includes an option to purchase the building at fair market value five years after construction is complete 
the expected minimum lease payments  including a annual rent increase  related to the building are million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million thereafter 
the fair value of the building is expected to be million and the building lease will be accounted for as a capital lease 
we believe cash on hand  funds generated from operations and other available debt facilities are sufficient to fund operating cash requirements and capital expenditures through fiscal  however  we may periodically utilize our lines of credit for working capital requirements 
current conditions in the capital markets are uncertain  however  we believe we will have adequate access to capital markets to fund future acquisitions 
pension and other post retirement benefit obligations our pension plans principally include a us pension plan maintained by esterline  non us plans maintained by leach  and non us plans maintained by cmc 
a us plan maintained by leach was merged into the us pension plan maintained by esterline as of march  our principal post retirement plans include non us plans maintained by cmc  which are non contributory health care and life insurance plans 
we account for pension expense using the end of the fiscal year as our measurement date and we make actuarially computed contributions to our pension plans as necessary to adequately fund benefits 
our funding policy is consistent with the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
in fiscal and  operating cash flow included million and million  respectively  of cash funding to these pension plans 
we expect pension funding requirements to be approximately million in fiscal for the plans maintained by cmc 
there is no minimum funding requirements for fiscal for the us pension plan maintained by esterline 
we may decide to make a discretionary contribution in fiscal the rate of increase in future compensation levels is consistent with our historical experience and salary administration policies 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on long term target asset allocations of equity and fixed income 
we periodically review allocations of plan assets by investment type and evaluate external sources of information regarding long term historical returns and expected future returns for each investment type and  accordingly  believe a assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is appropriate 
current allocations are consistent with the long term targets 
we made the following assumptions with respect to our pension obligation in and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate rate of increase in future compensation levels assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for our non us plans we use a discount rate for expected returns that is a spot rate developed from a yield curve established from high quality corporate bonds and matched to plan specific projected benefit payments 
for our us plan we use a discount rate which was determined by discounting the estimated cash flow of the us plan using spot rates from the citigroup pension discount curve  which reflects the current yields of high quality corporate bonds 
although future changes to the discount rate are unknown  had the discount rate increased or decreased by basis points in  pension liabilities in total would have decreased million or increased million  respectively 
if all other assumptions are held constant  the estimated effect on fiscal pension expense from a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in both the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material effect on our pension expense 
we made the following assumptions with respect to our post retirement obligation in and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate initial weighted average health care trend rate ultimate weighted average health care trend rate the assumed health care trend rate has a significant impact on our post retirement benefit obligations 
our health care trend rate was based on the experience of our plan and expectations for the future

seasonality the timing of our revenues is impacted by the purchasing patterns of our customers and  as a result  we do not generate revenues evenly throughout the year 
moreover  our first fiscal quarter  november through january  includes significant holiday vacation periods in both europe and north america 
this leads to decreased order and shipment activity  consequently  first quarter results are typically weaker than other quarters and not necessarily indicative of our performance in subsequent quarters

critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  accounting for inventories at the lower of cost or market  accounting for goodwill and intangible assets in business combinations  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  accounting for legal contingencies  accounting for pension benefits  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is determinable  and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize product revenues at the point of shipment or delivery in accordance with the terms of sale 
sales are net of returns and allowances 
returns and allowances are not significant because products are manufactured to customer specification and are covered by the terms of the product warranty 
revenues and profits on fixed price contracts with significant engineering as well as production requirements are recorded based on the achievement of contractual milestones and the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to total estimated costs for each contract cost to cost method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we review cost performance and estimates to complete on our ongoing contracts at least quarterly 
the impact of revisions of profit estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period they become evident 
amounts representing contract change orders are included in revenue only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable  and are determined on a percentage of completion basis measured by the cost to cost method 
claims are included in revenue only when they are probable of collection 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses expected to be incurred on accounts receivable balances 
judgment is required in estimation of the allowance and is based upon specific identification  collection history and creditworthiness of the debtor 
inventories we account for inventories on a first in  first out or average cost method of accounting at the lower of its cost or market 
the determination of market requires judgment in estimating future demand  selling prices and cost of disposal 
judgment is required when determining inventory reserves 
these reserves are provided when inventory is considered to be excess or obsolete based upon an analysis of actual on hand quantities on a part level basis to forecasted product demand and historical usage 
inventory reserves are released based upon adjustments to forecasted demand 
goodwill and intangible assets in business combinations we account for business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  statement no 
and financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  statement no 

statement no 
specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets statement no 
requires goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to be tested for impairment at least annually 
we are also required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  including a significant sustained decline in an entity s market value  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business  or other factors 
the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows  discount rates and estimated product life cycles 
in making these judgments  we evaluate the financial health of the business  including such factors as industry performance  changes in technology and operating cash flows 
statement no 
outlines a two step process for testing goodwill for impairment 
the first step step one of the goodwill impairment test involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit 
statement no 
defines fair value fair value as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or incurred or sold or settled in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced liquidation sale 
a reporting unit is generally defined at the operating segment level or at the component level one level below the operating segment  if said component constitutes a business 
the fair value of a reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value  which is defined as the book basis of total assets less total liabilities 
in the event a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value  evidence of potential impairment exists 
in such a case  the second step step two of the impairment test is required  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  with the excess of fair value over allocated net assets representing the fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill 
as we have grown through acquisitions  we have accumulated million of goodwill and million of indefinite lived intangible assets out of total assets of billion at october  the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
we performed our impairment review for fiscal as of august   and our step one analysis indicates that no impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived assets exists at any of our reporting units 
our cmc reporting unit s margin in passing the step one analysis was not as large as our other reporting units 
cmc s operating performance has been impacted by the effect of the weakening us dollar relative to the canadian dollar for most of the period we have owned the business 
in addition  operating results have been impacted by higher than expected costs related to certain long term development contracts  including the t b 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the us dollar has strengthened against the canadian dollar and if this relationship continues  cmc s results of operations will be favorably impacted 
we expect that the t b development will be successful and that cmc s operations will continue to improve due to recent contract wins  operational productivity improvements and a continued stronger us dollar relative to the canadian dollar 
it is possible  however  that as a result of events or circumstances  we could conclude at a later date that goodwill of million at cmc may be considered impaired 
we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if  due to a change in strategy or other reason  we determined the value of other assets has been impaired 
these other assets include net deferred income tax assets of million  trade names of million and intangible assets of million 
impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  statement no 

statement no 
requires that a long lived asset to be disposed of be reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
an asset other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
in the event the carrying amount of such asset is not deemed recoverable  the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value 
fair value is generally determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 
as we have grown through acquisitions  we have accumulated million of definite lived intangible assets 
the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
contingencies we are party to various lawsuits and claims  both as plaintiff and defendant  and have contingent liabilities arising from the conduct of business 
we are covered by insurance for general liability  product liability  workers compensation and certain environmental exposures  subject to certain deductible limits 
we are self insured for amounts less than our deductible and where no insurance is available 
financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
pension and other post retirement benefits we account for employee pension and post retirement benefit costs in accordance with the applicable statements issued by the financial accounting standards board 
in accordance with these statements  we select appropriate assumptions including discount rate  rate of increase in future compensation levels and assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and expected annual increases in costs of medical and other health care benefits in regard to our post retirement benefit obligations 
our assumptions are based upon historical results  the current economic environment and reasonable expectations of future events 
actual results which vary from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  accordingly  are recognized in expense in these periods 
significant differences between our assumptions and actual experience or significant changes in assumptions could impact the pension costs and the pension obligation 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  and account for reserves for income taxes in accordance with fin the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position and results of operations
