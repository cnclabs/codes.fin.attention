fiscal year overview the fiscal year ended september  represents the second full fiscal year of the company s execution of new strategic and operational plans developed by the company s new management team  led by president and chief executive officer woody hobbs 
these plans  as discussed regularly by us in various public statements  called for restoring the company to positive cash flow within the first year and announcing major new products early in the second year 
having achieved these objectives  we informed investors in various public statements that we would now focus on building out industry partnerships to integrate our new products with the offerings of other hardware and software vendors and on expanding our research and development efforts to assist in these integration initiatives 
our results for fiscal year reflect the success of initiatives taken by us and hence reflect a substantial improvement over the prior fiscal year  with revenues increasing by approximately 
similarly  total expenditures including operating expenses and costs of goods sold increased by approximately  reflecting our support for new product initiatives and certain expenses associated with our strategic initiatives 
during the fiscal year ended september   we recorded stock compensation expense under sfas no 
r which included stock options granted to the company s four most senior executives as approved by the company s stockholders on january  the performance options 
amortization of expense associated with the performance options began during the quarter ended march  and there were no similar charges in prior periods 
total expense recognized in the fiscal year ended september  from the performance options was million 
of this total  million is classified as general and administrative expense  million is classified as research and development expense and million is classified as sales and marketing expense 
we achieved positive net cash flow from operations of million during fiscal year  a substantial improvement from the prior fiscal year  when we had negative net cash flow from operations of million 
this 
table of contents improvement is the combined effect of our improved operating results and improved terms of trade with customers  which resulted from the company s new pricing policies and sales practices 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we had made significant changes in our pricing policies and sales practices and our revenues for the fiscal year ended september  reflect the continuing success of these initiatives 
during fiscal year  we executed additional significant long term volume purchase agreements vpas with several of our major customers 
combined with the effect of other similar agreements executed since fiscal year  we have achieved both a increase in our deferred revenue balances and a increase in our unbilled backlog of vpa agreements 
we consider these unbilled vpa commitments  along with deferred revenues  as order backlog 
our total order backlog increased by from million at september  to million at september  during the fiscal year ended september  we recruited a significant number of additional personnel  particularly into our research and development department 
as a result of this effort  and of the acquisitions we completed during the fiscal year  we increased our total workforce from employees at september  to at september  total revenues for the fiscal year ended september  increased by  or million  to million  from million for fiscal year the increase in revenues was principally attributable to recurring quarterly revenues associated with vpa and similar licenses  including revenues from customers who had generated little or no revenues in earlier periods as a result of having previously purchased fully paid up licenses 
fully paid up licenses gave customers unlimited distribution rights of the applicable product over a specific time period or with respect to a specific customer device 
in connection with paid up licenses  we recognized all license fees upon execution of the agreement  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria had been met 
paid up license agreements may have had the effect of accelerating revenues into the quarter in which the agreement was executed and thereby decreasing recurring revenues in subsequent periods 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we began changing our licensing practices away from heavy reliance on paid up licenses to i vpas for most large customers and ii pay as you go consumption based license arrangements for other customers 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completely ceased entering into paid up licenses with our customers  and converted to the use of only vpas and pay as you go consumption based license arrangements 
our revenues for the fiscal year ended september  include revenues from certain customers who had entered into fully paid up licenses in prior periods but who  as a result of the specific terms of those contracts or amendments thereto  were no longer authorized to continue to deploy the products covered by those licenses 
gross margin for fiscal year was million  a increase from the gross margin of million during fiscal year this increase resulted from the increase in revenues described above  combined with a lower rate of growth in the total cost of goods and services  which was principally the result of cost management initiatives in our customer service activities 
operating expenses for fiscal year were million  an increase of  from million for fiscal year of the million increase  million was due to stock based compensation expense resulting from the grant of the performance options approved by the company s stockholders on january   million was due to increased use of consultants  and million was due to higher salary and benefits principally as a result of increased headcount 
these increases were partly offset by lower facilities and other expenses of million 
during fiscal year  we experienced lower interest and other income and higher tax expense as compared to fiscal year the million lower interest and other income was primarily driven by lower interest rates 
the increase in tax expense was principally associated with higher revenue and related taxes in taiwan 
we experienced a net loss of million for fiscal year  compared to a net loss of million for fiscal year as described above  this million decrease in net loss was principally the result of the million increase in reported revenues offset by a million increase in costs of revenues  a million increase in operating expenses  a million reduction in interest and other income and a million increase in tax expense

in fiscal year  the company executed additional vpa transactions with certain of its customers with payment terms spread over periods of up to months 
consistent with our policy  only fees due within days are invoiced and recorded as revenues or deferred revenues 
vpa fees due beyond days are not invoiced or recorded by the company 
the company considers these unbilled vpa commitments  along with deferred revenues  as order backlog 
as of the end of fiscal year  total order backlog was approximately million  an increase of  or million  from the million balance at september  the company expects to recognize this million as revenues over future periods  however  uncertainties such as the timing of customer utilization of our products may impact the timing of recognition of these revenues 
the million order backlog as of september  is composed of million of unbilled vpa commitments and million of deferred revenue 
unbilled vpa commitments increased  or million  from the million balance at september  while deferred revenue increased  or million  from the million balance at september  the increases in unbilled vpa commitments and deferred revenue reflect the combined effect of overall business growth and the company s decision at the beginning of fiscal year to enter into certain agreements with major customers that extend for periods greater than one year

this balance is related solely to the restructuring activity which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal as noted above 
all other restructuring liabilities associated with the first quarter plan have been fully paid 
when the reserve was first established in the fourth quarter of fiscal  it had a liability balance of million which was comprised of a projected cash outflow of approximately million less a projected cash inflow of approximately million  though the reserve was later increased by million as the result of a change in estimated expenses 
the source of the cash inflow is a sublease of the facility that the company had vacated  and the sublease was executed as anticipated 
since the projected cash inflows exceed the projected cash outflows  the net balance is classified as an asset rather than a liability 
fiscal year restructuring plans in fiscal year  we implemented a number of cost reduction plans aimed at reducing costs which were not integral to our overall strategy and at better aligning our expense levels with our revenue expectations

table of contents we received notification in that the taiwan taxing authority disagrees with the transfer pricing used by us 
while we are in the process of contesting the assessment notices  we have received from the taiwan taxing authorities  there is no reasonable assurance as to the ultimate outcome 
we have therefore accrued but not paid the amount of the potential taiwanese tax liability related to the transfer pricing adjustment  should the taiwan taxing authority prevail

we expect to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or strategic investments in  businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to our business  which may require the use of cash 
future acquisitions could cause amortization expenses to increase 
in addition  if impairment events occur  they could also accelerate the timing of charges 

table of contents financial condition at september   our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents totaling million  compared to million at september  during fiscal year  cash decreased by million mainly as a result of investing activities totaling million which were composed of a million that we paid in cash net of cash acquired associated with the acquisition of beinsync ltd  b million that we paid in cash net of cash acquired associated with the acquisition of touchstone software corporation  c million that we paid in cash net of cash acquired associated with the acquisition of general software  inc  and d million for investment in property and equipment 
cash used in these investing activities was partly offset by million of cash provided by operating activities and million of cash provided by financing activities 
cash from operating activities resulted from a net loss of million which was offset by non cash charges of million for stock based compensation and million for depreciation and amortization as well as a million increase in taxes payable  a million increase in accounts receivable and a net million increase from other operating items 
cash from financing activities was due to the receipt of million from stock issuances under stock option and stock purchase plans offset by million paid for the repurchase of restricted common stock 
at september   our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents totaling million  compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at september  during fiscal year  to reduce administrative costs and liquidity risks  we implemented a change in our past practices regarding the investment of our cash which led to the elimination of our holdings of marketable securities and an increase in investments in money market funds  which are classified as cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet 
in connection with this change  we sold all of our marketable securities and invested the proceeds in money market funds 
our investment policy permits us to invest in securities with risks greater than those of money market funds and we may do so in the future 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal year was million  which was primarily due to our net loss of million  partly offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in other working capital items of approximately million and non cash items of depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively 
cash flows provided from investing activities for fiscal year were million  which were primarily due to proceeds from the sale of marketable securities  net of purchases  of approximately million  offset in part by equipment purchases of million and a technology acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal year of million 
cash flows provided from financing activities during fiscal year were million which related to the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash available from future operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we may incur a net loss in fiscal year and we may also incur negative net cash flow in fiscal year  if we are unable to achieve the revenues we anticipate or to successfully control our cash expenditures 
commitments as of september   we had commitments for million under non cancelable operating leases ranging from one to six years 
the operating lease obligations include a net lease commitment for the irvine  california location of million  after sublease income of million 
the irvine net lease commitment was included in our fiscal year first quarter restructuring plan 
the operating lease obligations also include i our facility in norwood  massachusetts which has been fully vacated and for which we have entered into a sublease agreement in october for the remainder of the term  and ii our facility in milpitas  california  which has been partially vacated and for which we entered into a sublease agreement in november see note restructuring charges to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our restructuring plans 

table of contents as of september   we had a non current income tax liability of million which was associated primarily with the accrual of income taxes on our operations in taiwan 
we have not included this amount in the contractual obligations table below as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of any settlement with the respective taxing authority  if any 
on september   our future commitments were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations note fiscal year note fiscal years note fiscal years note fiscal year there were no material commitments for capital expenditures or non cancelable purchase commitments as of september  off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet agreements

critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the following represent the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and are subject to the various estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of such financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates are reviewed by us on a regular basis and are also discussed by senior management with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide services including non recurring engineering  maintenance consisting of product support services and rights to unspecified updates on a when and if available basis and training 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when an agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element 
vsoe of fair value is generally the price charged when that element is sold separately or  for items not yet being sold  it is the price established by management that will not change before the introduction of the item into the marketplace 
under the residual method  the vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element s is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
we recognize revenues related to the delivered products or services only if the above revenue recognition criteria are met  any undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  and payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services 

table of contents pay as you go arrangements under pay as you go arrangements  license revenues from original equipment manufacturers oems and original design manufacturers odms are generally recognized in each period based on estimated consumption by the oems and odms of products containing our software  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we normally recognize revenues for all consumption prior to the end of the accounting period 
since we generally receive quarterly reports from oems and odms approximately to days following the end of a quarter  we have put processes in place to reasonably estimate revenues  including by obtaining estimates of production from oem and odm customers and by utilizing historical experience and other relevant current information 
to date the variances between estimated and actual revenues have been immaterial 
volume purchase arrangements beginning with the three month period ended march   with respect to volume purchase agreements vpas with oems and odms  we recognize license revenues for units consumed through the last day of the current accounting quarter  to the extent the customer has been invoiced for such consumption prior to the end of the current quarter and provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if the customer agreement provides that the right to consume units lapses at the end of the term of the vpa  we recognize revenues ratably over the term of the vpa if such ratable amount is higher than actual consumption as of the end of the current accounting quarter 
amounts that have been invoiced under vpas and relate to consumption beyond the current accounting quarter are recorded as deferred revenues 
for periods ended on or before december   we recognized revenues from vpas for units estimated to be consumed by the end of the following quarter  provided the customer had been invoiced for such consumption prior to the end of the current quarter and provided all other revenue recognition criteria had been met 
these estimates had historically been recorded based on customer forecasts 
actual consumption that was subsequently reported by these same customers was regularly compared to the previous estimates to confirm the reliability of this method of determining projected consumption 
our examination of reports received from the customers during april regarding actual consumption of our products during the three month period ended march  and a comparison of those consumption reports to forecasts previously provided by these customers  led us to the view that customer forecasts were no longer a reliable indicator of future consumption 
since we no longer considered customer forecasts to be a reliable estimate of future consumption  it became no longer appropriate to include future period consumption in current period revenues beginning with the quarter ended march  fully paid up license arrangements during fiscal year  we had increasingly relied on the use of software license agreements with our customers in which they paid a fixed upfront fee for an unlimited number of units  subject to certain phoenix product or design restrictions paid up licenses 
revenues from such paid up license arrangements were generally recognized upfront  provided all other revenues recognition criteria had been met 
effective september  we decided to eliminate the practice of entering into paid up licenses 
subscription fees subscription fees are revenues arising from agreements that provide for the ongoing delivery over a period of time of services  generally delivered over the internet 
primary subscription fee sources include fees charged for security  maintenance  back up  recovery and device management services 
revenue derived from sale of our on line subscription services are generally deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period  which typically ranges from one to three years 
services arrangements revenues for non recurring engineering services are generally on a time and materials basis and are recognized as the services are performed 
software maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the maintenance period  which is typically one year 
training and other service fees are recognized as services are 
table of contents performed 
amounts billed in advance for services that are in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues 
allowances for accounts receivable 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
at september  and  the allowance was approximately  and  respectively 
these estimates are based on our assessment of the probable collection from specific customer accounts  the aging of the accounts receivable  historical revenue variances  analysis of credit memo data  bad debt write offs  and other known factors 
if economic or specific industry trends worsen beyond our estimates  or if there is a deterioration of our major customers credit worthiness  or actual defaults are higher than our estimates based on historical experience  we would increase the allowance which would impact our results of operations 
intangible assets 
intangible assets include prepaid royalties  purchased technologies  customer relationships  goodwill and other intangibles 
at september  and  these assets  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million and million  respectively 
prepaid royalties represent payments to several third party technology partners for their software that is incorporated into certain of our products 
all other intangible assets were derived from our acquisitions 
the cost of the acquisitions is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including intangible assets based on their respective estimated fair value at the date of acquisition  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
the useful life of the intangible assets was estimated based on the period over which the assets were expected to contribute directly and indirectly to the future cash flows 
if assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
the allocation of the acquisition costs to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of management judgment 
the primary method used to determine the fair value of assets acquired is the income approach under which we must make assumptions as to the future cash flows of the acquired entity or assets  the appropriate discount rate to use to present value the cash flows and the anticipated life of the acquired assets 
the company determined the recorded values of intangible assets and goodwill with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist 
in fiscal years and  our purchases of intangible assets  other than goodwill  consisted of assets acquired from a xtool mobile security  inc  for million in august  b beinsysnc ltd 
for million in april  c touchstone software corporation for million in july  and d general software  inc for million in august the technology purchased from xtool mobile security  inc has not yet begun to be amortized 
this technology is being further developed to become a product  phoenix failsafe  to be sold by us 
when phoenix failsafe reaches a state of general release  then amortization will begin for the technology purchased from xtool mobile security in accordance with sfas no 
the amortization of other intangible assets acquired through the acquisitions of beinsync ltd  touchstone software corporation and general software  inc started from their respective dates of acquisition and is to be amortized over the estimated useful lives  ranging from one year to five years on a straight line basis 
all intangible assets are reviewed on a quarterly basis for potential impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
in fiscal years  and  there was no impairment of goodwill 
we recognized impairment charges of  million and million in  and  respectively  for intangible assets other than goodwill

income taxes 
estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes assets and valuation allowance when preparing our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and assess temporary differences due to different treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes  thereby resulting in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we perform an assessment of the recoverability of the deferred income tax assets  which is principally dependent upon our ability to achieve taxable income in specific geographies 

table of contents as of september   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of million  state net operating loss carry forwards of million  research and development credits of million  foreign tax credits carry forwards of million and state research and development tax credits of million available to offset future taxable income 
our carry forwards will expire over the periods through if not utilized 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
after examining the available evidence at september   we believe a full valuation allowance was appropriate for the us federal and state and certain foreign net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas no 
 evidence such as operating results during recent periods is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our past financial performance presented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our us federal and state and certain foreign deferred tax assets under sfas no 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of the us federal and state deferred tax assets 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain income tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
on october   we adopted the provisions of fin which provides recognition criteria and a related measurement model for tax positions taken by companies 
in accordance with fin  a tax position is a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax filing that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
tax positions shall be recognized only when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than that the position will be sustained upon examination 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold shall be measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
stock based compensation expense 
on october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized during the fiscal years ended september   and  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
and amortized on a graded vesting basis over the options vesting period  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r and amortized on a straight line basis over the options vesting period 
we elected to use the alternative transition provisions described in fasb staff position fas no 
r for the calculation of our pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we use the monte carlo option pricing model to value stock option grants that contain a market condition such as the options that were granted to our four most senior executives and approved by our stockholders on january  we use the black scholes option pricing model to value all other options granted since no other options granted contain a market condition 
the models require inputs such as expected term  expected volatility  expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate 
further  the forfeiture rate of options also affects the amount of aggregate compensation 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
while estimates of expected term  volatility and forfeiture rate are derived primarily from our historical data  the risk free interest rate is based on the yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues 
under sfas no 
r  we have divided option recipients into three groups outside directors  officers and non officer employees and determined the expected term and anticipated forfeiture rate for each group based on the historical activity of that group 
the expected term is then used in determining the applicable volatility and risk free interest rate 
retirement benefits 
we provide defined benefit plans in certain countries outside the united states 
the defined benefit plan for our employees in taiwan forms the vast majority of our payments and liability 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 
table of contents employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  and amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  sfas no 

we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
during fiscal year ended september  sfas no 
requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
this determination involves the selection of various assumptions  including an expected rate of return on plan assets  compensation increases and a discount rate 
at september  and  we accrued million and million  respectively  for all such liabilities 
in fiscal years and  we used the following assumptions in accounting for the taiwan defined benefit pension plan a discount rate of  a rate of compensation increases of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a the five year average return on plan assets of the trust department of bank of taiwan which is and b the fact that the return on plan assets of the trust department of bank of taiwan is trending upward 
changes in the above assumptions can impact our actuarially determined obligation and related expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk we consider investments purchased with an original remaining maturity of less than three months at date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
all investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents at september  and our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment in money market funds 
we do not use leverage or derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
during fiscal year  to reduce administrative costs and liquidity risks  we implemented a change in our practices regarding the investment of our cash which led to the elimination of our holdings of marketable securities and an increase in money market fund investments which are considered cash equivalents 
in connection with this change  we sold all of our marketable securities and invested the proceeds in money market funds 
our investment policy permits us to invest in securities with risks greater than those of money market funds and we may do so in the future 
a characteristic of money market funds is that their unit values are not generally sensitive to changes in interest rates 
therefore  investors in these funds are generally not subject to the risk of capital loss from sudden changes in interest rates 
in fiscal year  our investments were primarily debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  municipal bonds  and high quality corporate notes and by policy  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer was limited 
with these types of investments  a sharp increase in interest rates can have a materially negative impact on the valuation of the securities 
foreign currency risk international sales are primarily sourced in their respective countries and are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  our international subsidiaries  other than those located in israel and hungary  incur a significant portion of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  these foreign subsidiaries use their respective local currencies as the functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international operation  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
currencies in which we have significant intercompany balances are the taiwan dollar  indian 
table of contents rupee  hong kong dollar  japanese yen and the euro 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
the impact from a hypothetical and reasonably possible near term change of percent appreciation depreciation of the us dollar from september  market rates would be immaterial to our net loss
