we provide solutions to a diverse range of markets and geographic regions with the semiconductor capital market being our largest market 
sales to customers in the semiconductor capital equipment industry comprised of our sales in both and  and of our sales in other markets we sell to include flat panel display  data storage  architectural glass  solar inverter and other industrial thin film manufacturing 
our analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will be instructive for understanding the relevant trends going forward 
however  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  including the notes thereto

years ended december  v v v v in thousands united states europe asia total sales years ended december  united states europe asia the decrease in total sales from to and the increase in total sales from to principally reflect fluctuations in demand in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
the semiconductor capital equipment industry is highly cyclical and is impacted by changes in the macroeconomic environment  changes in semiconductor supply and demand and rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 
our sales to our largest semiconductor capital equipment customers represented the majority of the fluctuating sales volume 

table of contents applied materials inc  our largest customer  accounted for of our sales in  of our sales in and of our sales in ulvac  inc  our largest customer in the flat panel display industry  accounted for of our sales in with the exceptions of applied materials and ulvac  no single customer accounted for more than of our sales during  or gross profit our gross margin was in  in and in the decrease in our gross margin from to was primarily attributable to lower revenues and costs incurred in transitioning manufacturing from stolberg  germany to shenzhen  china and an additional charge of million to cost of goods sold related to a change in estimates of warranty expenses for two products 
the improvement in our gross margin from to was attributable to increased volume of production and advanced manufacturing processes in our china manufacturing facility  lower freight costs  increased utilization of local asian suppliers  design led cost reductions and the increase in sales 
operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the years ended  and years ended december  of sales in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative litigation settlement restructuring charges total operating expenses research and development the market for our products is characterized by ongoing technological changes 
we believe that continued and timely development of new  highly differentiated products and enhancements to our existing products in support of customer requirements is necessary for us to maintain a competitive position in the markets we serve 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development projects and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers and other industry leaders in order to remain responsive to their product requirements 
we believe that the continued investment in research and development and ongoing development of new products are essential to the expansion of our markets  and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development activities 
all of our research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
the increase in our research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increased compensation expense related to development of new and existing platforms to support business growth  such as the solar inverter  solaron 
the increase in our research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increased compensation and non cash  stock based compensation expense of million as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r  additional research projects in response to customer requests and costs incurred to support the development of new products and enhancement of existing products 
selling  general and administrative our selling expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities that include personnel  trade shows  advertising  third party sales representative commissions  and other selling and marketing activities 

table of contents our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate  legal  tax  financial  governance  administrative  information systems and human resource functions in addition to our general management 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense from to remained flat as increases in audit  legal and compensation costs were offset by decreases in insurance expense  property tax expense and depreciation 
the increase from to was primarily due to increased compensation expense  increased commissions  and non cash stock based compensation expense of million as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r on january  litigation settlement on october   we executed a settlement agreement with mks instruments  inc mks  resolving all pending claims worldwide relating to our xstream with active matching network reactive gas generator products 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  we paid mks million in cash 
we also stipulated to a final judgment of infringement and an injunction prohibiting us from making  using  selling  offering to sell  or importing into the united states  or any country in which a counterpart patent exists  our xstream products and all other toroidal plasma generator products  except as permitted under the settlement agreement 
sales of these products have accounted for less than of our total sales each year since introduction of the products 
restructuring charges on march   we announced the closure of our manufacturing  distribution and research and development facility located in stolberg  germany 
related to this manufacturing transition  we recorded restructuring charges of million in  associated with employee separation costs and the write down of certain real and personal property located at this facility to estimated fair value 
on october   we completed the sale of assets related to our lppa product line for million and recorded the net gain on the sale of  as a credit to the restructuring charge 
at the end of  we announced major changes in our operations  which we began implementing in these included establishing the manufacturing location in china  consolidating worldwide sales forces  a move to lower cost asian suppliers  and the closure or sale of certain facilities 
we recorded restructuring charges associated with these changes of  in and million in in the first quarter of  we restructured a portion of our general and administrative operations 
in conjunction with this  we will record approximately million in restructuring charges in the first quarter of impairment of intangible assets we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill as of the end of each fiscal year 
additionally  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable  we perform tests for impairment of these assets and record impairment charges  as necessary 
such events or circumstances include downturns or anticipated downturns in the industries in which we serve  changes in customer technology requirements  and other changes in circumstances affecting the underlying value of the recorded asset 
other income expense other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous gains  losses  income and expense items 

table of contents income from investments and cash was approximately million in  million in and million in the increase in income from investments was primarily due to our higher level of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities generated from operations and net proceeds from our public offering of million shares in this was offset in by our use of those proceeds to redeem our convertible subordinated notes in september interest expense was approximately  in   in and million in in and  interest expense consisted principally of borrowings under capital lease facilities and senior debt  and amortization of our deferred debt issuance costs 
interest expense for also includes our convertible subordinated notes  which were redeemed in september our foreign subsidiaries sales are primarily denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
we recorded net foreign currency loss of million in and  in  and a net foreign currency gain of  in the loss in is primarily due to a net charge of million in the third quarter of related to a foreign exchange loss during the quarter  as the japanese yen and euro strengthened relative to the us dollar 
debt extinguishment expense of million in resulted from the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes with a total principal balance of million 
the expense of million is comprised of million for redemption premium and million for the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  computed at the expected tax rates for the periods in which the assets or liabilities will be realized  as well as for the expected tax benefit of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in  we began recording valuation allowances against certain of our united states and foreign net deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where we had incurred significant losses 
given such experience  prior to december   management could not conclude that it was more likely than not that these net deferred tax assets would be realized 
based on our and operating results  our management  in accordance with sfas no 
 evaluated the recoverability of its net deferred tax assets and concluded that it was more likely than not that the majority of net deferred tax assets would be realized 
the reduction in the valuation allowance was million for the entire year 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those difference become deductible  the timing and amount of which is uncertain 
we assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize a portion or all of our remaining net deferred tax assets  some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed with a corresponding reduction in income tax expense in such period 
the income tax expense of million in represents an effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of 
the income tax benefit of million in represents an effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of 
this negative rate includes the impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance discussed above 
the income tax provision of million in represents an effective tax rate on income from continuing operations of  due to taxable income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the company s income from discontinued operations earned in prior periods was earned in the united states 
no provision for income taxes is attributed to these discontinued operations  due to the reversal of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the united states that existed in those periods  including those generated by net operating losses  that offset the income from discontinued operations 

table of contents approximately million of net deferred tax assets at december  related to certain us net operating losses that are subject to limitations under the us tax code 
these assets continue to have a full valuation allowance as management could not conclude that it was more likely than not that these net deferred tax assets would be realized 
when recording acquisitions  we have recorded valuation allowances due to the uncertainty related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets existing at the acquisition dates 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
at december   approximately million of the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets obtained through acquisition 
any reversals of valuation allowances recorded in purchase accounting will be reflected as a reduction of goodwill in the period of reversal 
for the year ended december   million of valuation allowances  representing of the valuation allowances established in purchase accounting  were reversed with a corresponding reduction in goodwill 
there are no further adjustments related to these items to be booked in the current or future periods 
please refer to note income taxes included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion regarding income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fin as of january  upon adoption  the company increased the long term liability associated with uncertain tax positions by approximately million and also increased the long term receivable by approximately million consisting of offsetting tax benefits 
the balance of million is an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on january  if the tax position reverses  the net million will affect our effective tax rate 
there have been no significant changes to these amounts during the year ended december  the tax years through remain open to examination by the united states taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
the foreign taxing jurisdictions have open tax years from through in accordance with our accounting policy  we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense 
this policy did not change as a result of the adoption of fin we did not have any accrued interest or penalties at december  we do not anticipate a material change to the amount of unrecognized tax positions within the next months 
while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions  amounts asserted by taxing authorities could materially differ from our accrued positions as a result of uncertain and complex application of tax regulations 
additionally  the recognition and measurement of certain tax benefits includes estimates and judgment by management and inherently includes subjectivity 
accordingly  additional provisions on federal and foreign tax related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations was million in and million in in  we sold the assets of our emco product line and our ikor product line  as they were not critical to our core operations 
we recognized a gain on the sale of the emco product line of million and a gain on the sale of the ikor product line of million 
in the second quarter of   held in escrow relating to the emco product line was released and in the fourth quarter of  million held in escrow relating to the ikor product line was released as various contingencies were resolved 
these amounts were recorded as gains on the sale of discontinued assets 
quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly results in dollars and as a percentage of sales for each of the 
table of contents eight quarters in the period ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information 
due to the volatility of the industries in which our customers operate the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent period

 percentage of sales sales gross profit income from operations income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents of million and marketable securities of million 
included in our marketable securities as of december  was approximately million in auction rate securities 
subsequent to december   we sold approximately million in municipal auction rate securities 
however  beginning in february  we experienced difficulty in selling additional securities due to the failure of the auction mechanism which provides liquidity to these securities 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned every days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
accordingly  there may be no effective mechanism for selling these securities and we may own long term investments 
as of march   the company had approximately million of auction rate securities and continued deterioration in the credit and equity markets  continued failed auctions or the lack of a developing secondary market may potentially cause impairment in the value of these securities or negatively impact our ability to liquidate these securities 
during  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased million  or  from million at december   primarily due to cash generated from our operations 

table of contents operating activities provided cash of million in  million in  and million in the increase in cash was primarily due to cash generated from operations partially offset by increased inventory 
investing activities used cash of million in and million in  and provided cash of million in in  we purchased million and sold million in marketable securities  as compared to the purchase of million of marketable securities in  and the purchases of million and sales of million of marketable securities used to redeem a portion of the convertible subordinated notes in capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in cash provided by investing activities in also reflects million received on the sale of our ikor product line and million on the sale of our emco product line 
with the significant capital expenditures related to our investment in our manufacturing operations as well as our information technology infrastructure  we expect to increase our capital expenditures in to approximately million 
our planned level of capital expenditures is subject to frequent revisions as our business experiences sudden changes 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may significantly impact our capital expenditures in a particular period 
investing cash flows experience significant fluctuations from year to year as we buy and sell marketable securities  which we convert to cash to fund strategic investments and our current operations  and as we transfer cash into marketable securities when we attain levels of cash that are greater than needed for current operations 
financing activities provided cash of million in  primarily due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
financing activities used cash of  in  due primarily to million in payments on our senior borrowings and capital lease obligations offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million  as compared to million in  primarily due to the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes offset in part by our public offering of common stock 
during the third quarter of  we raised million in net proceeds from a public offering of million shares of common stock 
with these proceeds we fully redeemed the convertible subordinated notes due november  this redemption consisted of a million principal payment   for redemption premium  and million for interest through the redemption dates 
after the redemption of the convertible subordinate notes  proceeds of approximately million remained 
these proceeds together with approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were used to redeem the convertible subordinated notes due september  this redemption consisted of a million principal payment  million for redemption premium  and million for interest through the redemption dates 
we expect our financing activities to continue to fluctuate in the future 
our financing payments may also increase in the future if we enter into additional capital lease obligations or utilize our line of credit 
a significant portion of these obligations are held in countries other than the united states  therefore  future foreign currency fluctuations  especially between the us dollar and the japanese yen  could cause significant fluctuations in our estimated payment obligations 
we currently have a million secured revolving line of credit with a maturity date of july  any advances under our amended credit facility will bear interest at the prime rate at march  minus 
no amounts are currently outstanding under this credit facility 
on december   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock 
purchases under the program may be made from time to time in the open market  through privately negotiated transactions  through block trades  rule b trading plans or other available means 
there is no minimum number of shares to be repurchased under the program and the program may be discontinued at any time 
purchases under the program will depend upon the availability of cash  as well as prevailing general economic and stock market conditions 

table of contents we believe that our working capital  together with cash anticipated to be generated by operations and our line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future payments due under contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands thereafter total operating lease obligations non cancelable purchase obligations severance obligation capital lease obligations as of december   we have million in uncertain tax positions  net of federal benefit 
because of the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments  these liabilities are not reflected in the contractual obligations table 
critical accounting policies and estimates the above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related notes under part ii  item of this form k and believe that our accounting policies are reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  are most critical as they relate to our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition most of the company s product revenue is recognized upon shipment of the company s products  at which time title passes to the customer  the price is fixed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the remainder of the company s product revenue is recognized upon receipt of the products by the customer  at which time title passes to the customer  the price is fixed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from contracts that contain specific customer acceptance provisions are deferred until customer acceptance occurs 
generally  the company does not have obligations to its customers after its products are shipped under standard shipping terms  after its products are received by customers under destination terms  and after the products are accepted by customers under contractual acceptance provisions  other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
in limited instances  the company provides installation of its products 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the company allocates revenue based on the fair value of the delivered item  generally the product  and the undelivered item  installation  based on their respective fair values 
revenue related to the undelivered item is deferred until the services have been completed 
in certain instances  the company requires its customers to pay for a portion or all of their purchases prior to the company building or shipping these products 
cash payments received prior to shipment are recorded as customer deposits and deferred revenue in the condensed consolidated balance sheets  and then recognized as revenue as 
table of contents appropriate based upon the transfer of title of the products 
the company does not offer price protection to customers or allow returns  unless covered by our normal policy for repair of defective products 
warranty policy we offer warranty coverage for our products for periods typically ranging from to months after shipment 
we estimate the anticipated costs of repairing products under warranty based on the historical or expected cost of the repairs and expected failure rates 
the assumptions used to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated quarterly  at a minimum  in light of actual experience and  when appropriate  the accruals or the accrual percentage is adjusted based on specific estimates of project repair costs and quantity of product returns 
our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is based on estimates of the percentage of units affected and the repair costs 
estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale of the related product  and are recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
excess and obsolete inventory inventory is written down or written off when it becomes obsolete  generally due to engineering changes to a product or discontinuance of a product line  or when it is deemed excess 
judgment by management is necessary in estimating the net realizable value of inventory based primarily upon forecasts of product demand 
charges for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded  as necessary  within cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r to account for its stock plans and employee stock purchase plan  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation in the statement of income 
the fair value of stock options and purchase rights pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected life of the award  forfeiture rate and expected stock price volatility 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based upon the company s closing stock price on the grant date 
the fair value of stock based awards expected to vest is amortized over the requisite service period  typically the vesting period  of the award on a straight line basis 
commitments and contingencies from time to time we are involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of our business see item within part i and note within part ii  item 
while we currently believe that the amount of any ultimate loss would not be material to our financial position  the outcome of these actions is inherently difficult to predict 
in the event of an adverse outcome  the ultimate loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or reported results of operations in a particular quarter 
an unfavorable decision  particularly in patent litigation  could require material changes in production processes and products or result in our inability to ship products or components found to have violated third party patent rights 
we accrue loss contingencies in connection with our commitments and contingencies  including litigation  when it is probable that a loss has occurred or will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  computed at the tax rates expected in the period that the assets or liabilities are realized  as well as for the expected tax benefit of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
our assessment includes a number of factors  including historical results and income projections for each jurisdiction 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize a portion or all of our remaining net deferred tax assets  some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed with a corresponding reduction in income tax expense in such period 
we adopted the provision of fin fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin as of january  
table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill is not amortized 
we use a two step approach to assess our goodwill annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
in step of the assessment the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if an impairment of goodwill is indicated 
the estimated fair value is based on market capitalization  as complemented by a discounted cash flow analysis 
if no impairment is indicated in step no additional analysis is performed 
should an impairment be indicated the company would determine any loss in step by comparing the enterprise s implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill 
finite lived intangible assets continue to be amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
see note summary of significant accounting policies in our notes to consolidated financial statements for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments in marketable securities consisted primarily of commercial paper  municipal bonds  auction rate securities and notes and institutional money markets 
with the exception due to market conditions of the auction rate securities  these securities are highly liquid 
earnings on our marketable securities are typically invested into similar securities 
we believe that a decrease in average interest rates on these instruments would not have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
our primary foreign currency cash flows are generated in countries in asia and europe 
it is highly uncertain how currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future 
we enter into various foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate risk of currency fluctuations in the british pound  european euro  japanese yen  taiwanese dollar  south korean won and chinese yuan 
the notional amount of our foreign currency contracts at december  was million 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates at december   would be approximately million  which would be essentially offset by corresponding gains related to the underlying assets 
at december  we held foreign currency forward exchange contracts  maturing through january  primarily 
table of contents to purchase us dollars and sell various foreign currencies 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contracts as of december  market notional settlement unrealized in thousands amounts amounts gain loss in thousands purchase contracts british pound contract south korean won contract taiwanese dollar contract auction rate securities risk we face market risk exposure associated with our investments in auction rate securities 
as of december   we held approximately million in auction rate securities 
subsequent to december   we sold approximately million in municipal auction rate securities 
however  starting in february  we experienced difficulty in selling additional securities due to the failure of the auction mechanism which provides liquidity to these securities 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest and be auctioned every days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
accordingly  there may be no effective mechanism for selling these securities at face value  however  we intend to continue to attempt to sell our auction rate securities without a loss in principal and thus these securities are classified as short term investments 
as of march   the company had approximately million of auction rate securities and continued deterioration in the credit and equity markets  continued failed auctions or the lack of a developing secondary market may potentially cause impairment in the value of these securities or negatively impact our ability to liquidate these securities
