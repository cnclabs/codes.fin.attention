executive overview stel s earnings per diluted share declined in versus net revenue was million for the year ended december  as compared to million in stel earned million or per diluted share  a decrease of from earnings of million or per diluted share 
stel generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities in it paid dividends to stockholders of million  invested million in capital expenditures and borrowed approximately million in long term debt  net 
despite a difficult operating environment for banks in  related margin compression during the year  stel has gained momentum in fee income and our trust company posted record earnings for the year 
in an effort to improve overall efficiency  reductions in noninterest expense during the second half of the year were also noted 
while non performing assets declined from third quarter and past dues continue to be low  we are experiencing a volatile credit cycle and slowing economy  and have appropriately increased our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loan receivable 
higher levels of non performing assets and net charge offs are anticipated in on february   the company consummated the merger of equals with fnb corporation to create the largest independent commercial bank headquartered in virginia 
upon consummation combined assets totaled billion  liabilities totaled billion and equity totaled million 
under the terms of the merger fnb shareholders received shares of combined company common stock for their shares of fnb common stock 
each share of stel common stock became one share of common stock of the combined company 
the combined company operates full service branches throughout virginia 
stel s focus for will be to enhance shareholder value by ensuring the efficiency opportunities afforded by the merger are realized  completing the internal reorganization in order to significantly reduce overhead  leveraging the combined company s capital base to seek acquisition and merger partners  concentrate on retail delivery optimization throughout the expanded geographic footprint and move into higher growth markets which should accelerate both our growth and earnings 
additionally  we will focus on increasing our earnings potential through new lines of business like private banking  wholesale mortgage banking  improved internet capabilities  wealth management  and utilize our increased lending capacity 
non gaap financial measures this report refers to the efficiency ratio  which is computed by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income  net of gains or losses on securities  fixed assets and foreclosed assets 
the efficiency ratio is not a recognized reporting measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states usgaap 
we believe this measure provides investors with important information regarding our operational efficiency 
management believes such financial information is meaningful to the reader in understanding operating performance  but cautions that such information not be viewed as a substitute for usgaap 
stel  in referring to its net income  is referring to income under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
comparison of our efficiency ratio with those of other companies may not be possible  because other companies may calculate the efficiency ratio differently 
critical accounting policies general the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states usgaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures and estimates of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  usgaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
the company s affiliate banks conduct an analysis of the loan portfolio on a regular basis 
this analysis is used in assessing the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses and in the determination of the necessary provision for loan losses 
the review process generally begins with lenders identifying problem loans to be reviewed on an individual basis for impairment 
when a loan has been identified as impaired  a specific reserve may be established based on the bank s calculation of the loss embedded in the individual loan 
in addition to impairment testing  the banks have an eight point grading system for each non homogeneous loan in the portfolio 
the loans meeting the criteria for impairment are segregated from performing loans within the portfolio 
loans are then grouped by loan type and  in the case of commercial and construction loans  by risk rating 
each loan type is assigned an allowance factor based on historical loss experience  economic conditions  overall portfolio quality including delinquency rates and commercial real estate loan concentrations 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
larger groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the company does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures  unless such loans are subject to a restructuring agreement 
goodwill goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
in this testing  the company employs general industry practices in accordance with usgaap 
a fair value is determined for each reporting unit using various market valuation methodologies 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less  an expense may be required on the company s books to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
the company tests for impairment of goodwill in september each year  and again at any quarter end if any material events occur during a quarter that may affect goodwill 
through its annual analysis as of september   the company has not identified any impairment of its goodwill 
no events occurred during the fourth quarter necessitating a re test of goodwill impairment 
no assurance can be given that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability or balance sheet method 
under this method  the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various balance sheet assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws 
stock based compensation the company has a stock based employee compensation plan under which nonqualified stock options may be granted periodically to certain employees 
the company s stock options typically have an exercise price equal to at least the fair value of the stock on the date of grant  and vest based on continued service with the company for a specified period  generally five years 
the company adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation effective january  using the modified prospective method and as such  results for prior periods have not been restated 
prior to january   the value of restricted stock awards was expensed by the company over the restriction period  and no compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants as all such grants had an exercise price not less than fair market value on the date of grant 
sfas r also requires that new awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested be recognized as compensation cost over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award 
results of operations net interest income the primary source of stel s traditional banking revenue is net interest income  which represents the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets 
earning assets include loans  securities  and federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities include deposits and borrowings 
to compare the tax exempt yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on a federal corporate income tax rate 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates  volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities  and the composition of those assets and liabilities 
the interest rate spread and net interest margin are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income 
the interest rate spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is defined as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
earning assets obtained through noninterest bearing sources of funds such as regular demand deposits and stockholders equity result in a net interest margin that is higher than the interest rate spread 
compared to tax equivalent net interest income in was million  a decrease of million or compared to million in increased funding costs associated with competition for deposits in local markets which resulted in heavier reliance on wholesale funding  a lower rate of growth in loans receivable and average earning assets combined with margin compression related to falling rates late in the year while slightly asset sensitive led to this decrease 
average interest earning assets increased million or to billion  while average loans increased or to billion 
the average interest rate spread was in  down twenty two basis points from in the net interest margin was in  down seventeen basis points from in the decrease in the company s net interest margin was a result of being in a slightly asset sensitive position in a falling rate environment and the increased reliance on wholesale funding due to asset growth and deposit run off caused by strong competition for deposits within local markets 
the yield on average loans increased nineteen basis points in  while the yield on investment securities increased six basis points for the period 
interest expense as a percentage of average earning assets increased to  up thirty eight basis points from in  reflecting a thirty eight basis point increase in average cost of retail deposits to  and an forty two basis point increase in average total funding cost to 
compared to tax equivalent net interest income in was million  an increase of million or compared to million in improvements in the growth and mix of average earning assets were primary contributors to this growth and outpaced the margin compression for the year 
average interest earning assets increased million or to billion  while average loans increased or to billion 
the average interest rate spread was in  down eighteen basis points from in the net interest margin was in  down four basis points from in the slight decrease in the company s net interest margin was a result of several factors  including a modestly liability sensitive position in a rising rate environment  additional wholesale funding costs and a more aggressive pricing of deposits with durations of nine months or less to minimize exposure to a potential downward cycle in short term rates  offset partially by the aforementioned changes in asset mix 
the yield on average loans increased seventy one basis points in  reflecting the increase in short term rates during the year  while the yield on investment securities increased thirty seven basis points for the period 
interest expense as a percentage of average earning assets increased to  up sixty eight basis points from in  reflecting a seventy three basis point increase in average cost of retail deposits to  and an eighty three basis point increase in average total funding cost to

asset quality the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate  in management s judgment  of the amount needed to absorb losses incurred through the reporting date on existing loans in the portfolio

the allowance for loan losses was of outstanding loans as of december  and as of both december  and the allowance as a percentage of loans increased during when compared to and due to the following a real estate market that remains soft 
commercial real estate activity experienced a significant decline in our markets during the second half of and continued to weaken throughout the number of building permits issued  median home sales prices  new homes in inventory  number of days on market  housing affordability and new mortgage originations indicate that a general cyclical decline in the residential real estate market has and still is occurring as well 
the growing popularity of and problems noted with non traditional mortgage products 
while the company s affiliate banks do not originate non traditional mortgages within their own portfolios  we do have the risk associated with borrowers who have them 
the allowance analysis has considered this and other qualitative factors 
net charge offs recoveries were million during  compared to thousand during and thousand during the percentage of net charge offs recoveries to average loans was for  for  and for  reflecting a higher level of charge off experience

additionally  market conditions noted in the current year also support this allocation increase 
the largest allowance allocation continues to be to the real estate mortgage loan portfolio  which represents approximately of the allowance balance at december  the increase in was primarily the result of commercial real estate loan growth  which normally carries a higher risk rating and allowance allocation than family mortgages 
the real estate mortgage category represented of total loans outstanding at year end  of which approximately represented a non homogeneous portfolio consisting of loans collateralized by commercial real estate

non performing assets consist of stel s non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings  and other property owned 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when the collection of principal and interest is ninety days or more past due  or earlier  if collection is uncertain based on an evaluation of the net realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower 
for those loans which are carried on non accrual status  interest is recognized on a cash basis 
at december   total non performing assets totaled million  an increase of million from the increase in non performing assets is a result of a million commercial credit that was put on nonaccrual status during the third quarter  written down million and subsequently foreclosed upon during the fourth quarter 
for  total nonperforming assets were million  an increase of million from the increase in is attributable to several small relationships that are well collateralized 
all remaining restructured loans are performing as agreed and  in the opinion of management  were adequately reserved

additionally  capital management must also consider acquisition opportunities that may exist  and the resulting accounting treatment 
stel s capital management strategies have been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to stockholders  while maintaining its well capitalized position at each of the banking subsidiaries 
the primary source of additional capital to stel is earnings retention  which represents net income less dividends declared 
during  stel retained million  or of its net income 
stockholders equity increased by million  reflecting comprehensive income of million related primarily to unrealized gains on securities available for sale during the period 
stel and its banking affiliates are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on stel and the affiliate banks financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action under fdicia  stel and its banking affiliates must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and reclassifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require stel and its banking affiliates to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to average assets 
as of december   and  stel and the subsidiary banks met all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and are categorized as well capitalized 
there are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the subsidiary banks category 
liquidity liquidity is identified as the ability to generate or acquire sufficient amounts of cash when needed and at a reasonable cost to accommodate withdrawals  payments of debt  and increased loan demand 
these events may occur daily or at other short term intervals in the normal operation of the business 
experience helps management predict time cycles in the amount of cash required 
in assessing liquidity  management gives consideration to relevant factors including stability of deposits  quality of assets  economic conditions in the market served  concentrations of business and industry  competition  and stel s overall financial condition 
stel s bank affiliates have available a combined million line of credit with the federal home loan bank of atlanta  unused lines of credit totaling million with nonaffiliated banks and access to the federal reserve discount window to support liquidity as conditions dictate 
the liquidity of the parent company also represents an important aspect of liquidity management 
the parent company s cash outflows consist of overhead associated with corporate expenses  executive management  finance  marketing  loan and deposit operations  information technology  human resources  audit  compliance and credit administration functions 
it also includes outflows associated with dividends to shareholders 
the main sources of funding for the parent company are the management fees and dividends it receives from its banking and trust subsidiaries  nonrated commercial paper issued by the company  a working line of credit with a correspondent bank  and availability of the trust preferred security market as deemed necessary 
during  the banking subsidiaries and the non bank subsidiary paid million in management fees and transferred million in dividends to stel 
as of january   the aggregate amount of additional unrestricted funds  which could be transferred from the banking subsidiaries to stel without prior regulatory approval totaled million or of the consolidated net assets 
the parent company generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities in it paid dividends to stockholders of million  invested million in fixed assets and borrowed million under its commercial paper program which it invested in short term investment instruments 
contractual obligations the impact of our contractual obligations as of december  on liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total one year or less years years more than years certificates of deposit subordinated debt fhlb borrowings operating leases total the subordinated debt securities mature on june   but are callable beginning in june it is likely that the company will exercise it s rights under the call provisions and retire this debt instrument at the call date 
other commitments commitment expiration by period in thousands total one year or less years years more than years commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit mortgage loans sold with potential recourse in the judgment of management  stel maintains the ability to generate sufficient amounts of cash to cover normal requirements and any additional needs which may arise  within realistic limitations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company has not participated in any material unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
stel does have significant commitments to fund loans in the ordinary course of business 
at december  and  the following financial instruments were outstanding whose contract amounts represent credit risk commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit mortgage loans sold with potential recourse commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
the commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by the company  is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit  revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
these lines of credit are usually uncollateralized and do not always contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the company is committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the company generally holds collateral supporting those commitments  if deemed necessary 
the company  through its banking subsidiaries  originates loans for sale to secondary market investors subject to contractually specified and limited recourse provisions 
in  the company originated million and sold million to investors  compared to million originated and million sold in most contracts with investors contain certain recourse language which may vary from days up to twelve months 
the company may have an obligation to repurchase a loan if the mortgagor has defaulted early in the loan term 
mortgages subject to recourse are collateralized by single family residences  have loan to value ratios of or less  or have private mortgage insurance or are insured or guaranteed by an agency of the united states government 
at december   the company had locked rate commitments to originate mortgage loans amounting to approximately million and loans held for sale of million 
the company has entered into commitments  on a best effort basis to sell loans of approximately million 
risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
the company does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations

in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which revises sfas no 
and changes multiple aspects of the accounting for business combinations 
under the guidance in sfas no 
r  the acquisition method must be used  which requires the acquirer to recognize most identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at their full fair value on the acquisition date 
goodwill is to be recognized as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of the noncontrolling interest over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as a liability are to be recognized in earnings  while contingent consideration classified as equity is not to be remeasured 
costs such as transaction costs are to be excluded from acquisition accounting  generally leading to recognizing expense and additionally  restructuring costs that do not meet certain criteria at acquisition date are to be subsequently recognized as post acquisition costs 
sfas no 
r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact that this issuance will have on its consolidated financial statements  however  it anticipates that the standard will lead to more volatility in the results of operations during the periods subsequent to an acquisition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 

sfas no 
requires that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary ie minority interest be reported in the equity section of the balance sheet instead of being reported as a liability or in the mezzanine section between debt and equity 
it also requires that the consolidated income statement include consolidated net income attributable to both the parent and noncontrolling interest of a consolidated subsidiary 
a disclosure must be made on the face of the consolidated income statement of the net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest 
also  regardless of whether the parent purchases additional ownership interest  sells a portion of its ownership interest in a subsidiary or the subsidiary participates in a transaction that changes the parent s ownership interest  as long as the parent retains controlling interest  the transaction is considered an equity transaction 
sfas no 
is effective for annual periods beginning after december  management does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity financial institutions can be exposed to several market risks that may impact the value or future earnings capacity of an organization 
these risks involve interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk and equity market price risk 
stel s primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is inherent because as a financial institution  stel derives a significant amount of its operating revenue from purchasing funds customer deposits and borrowings at various terms and rates 
these funds are then invested into earning assets loans  leases  investments  etc 
at various terms and rates 
this risk is further discussed below 
equity market risk is not a significant risk to stel as equity investments on a cost basis comprise less than of corporate assets 
stel does not have any exposure to foreign currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to fluctuations in stel s future earnings earnings at risk and value economic value at risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
this exposure results from differences between the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that reprice within a specified time period as a result of scheduled maturities and repayment and contractual interest rate changes 
the primary objective of stel s asset liability management process is to maximize current and future net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate risk while satisfying liquidity and capital requirements 
management recognizes that a certain amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate  yet is not essential to stel s profitability 
thus the goal of interest rate risk management is to maintain a balance between risk and reward such that net interest income is maximized while risk is maintained at a tolerable level 
the company assumes interest rate risk the risk that general interest rate levels will change as a result of its normal operations 
as a result  the fair values of the company s financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the company 
management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk 
however  borrowers with fixed rate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment 
conversely  depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment 
management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans and deposits and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate the company s overall interest rate risk 
management endeavors to control the exposures to changes in interest rates by understanding  reviewing and making decisions based on its risk position 
the corporate asset liability committee is responsible for these decisions 
stel primarily uses the securities portfolios and fhlb advances to manage its interest rate risk position 
additionally  pricing  promotion and product development activities are directed in an effort to emphasize the loan and deposit term or repricing characteristics that best meet current interest rate risk objectives 
at present  stel does not use off balance sheet instruments 
the committee operates under management policies defining guidelines and limits on the level of risk 
these policies are approved by the boards of directors of the company and bank subsidiaries 
stel uses simulation analysis to assess earnings at risk and economic value of equity analysis to assess value at risk 
these methods allow management to regularly monitor both the direction and magnitude of stel s interest rate risk exposure 
these modeling techniques involve assumptions and estimates that inherently cannot be measured with complete precision 
key assumptions in the analyses include maturity and repricing characteristics of both assets and liabilities  prepayments on amortizing assets  other imbedded options  non maturity deposit sensitivity and loan and deposit pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
however  the analyses are useful in quantifying risk and provide a relative gauge of stel s interest rate risk position over time 
earnings at risk simulation analysis evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months 
the resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of stel s shorter term interest rate risk 
the analysis utilizes a static balance sheet approach 
the measurement date balance sheet composition or mix is maintained over the simulation time period with maturing and repayment dollars being rolled back into like instruments for new terms at current market rates 
additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under the various rate scenarios 
these include prepayment assumptions on mortgage assets  the sensitivity of non maturity deposit rates  and other factors deemed significant 
the simulation analysis results are presented in the table below 
these results  as of december   indicate that stel would expect net interest income to decrease over the next twelve months by assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points and to decrease by if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
this profile reflects a moderate interest rate risk position and is well within the guidelines set by policy 
year net interest income simulation in thousands bp shock bp shock economic value of equity the economic value of equity eve analysis provides information on the risk inherent in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the simulation analysis due to the shorter time horizon used in that analysis 
the eve of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of expected asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of expected liability cash flows 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining the expected cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in eve in various rate scenarios is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
the eve analysis results are presented in the table below 
these results as of december  indicate that the eve would increase assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points and decrease if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
the risk position of stel is within the guidelines set by policy
