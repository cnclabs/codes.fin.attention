overview calamp corp 
calamp or the company  formerly known as california amplifier  inc  is a leading provider of high value mission critical wireless communications solutions that enable anytime anywhere access 
calamp s wireless datacom division services the public safety  industrial monitoring and controls  and mobile resource management market segments with wireless solutions built on communications technology platforms that include proprietary licensed narrowband  standards based unlicensed broadband and cellular networks 
calamp s satellite division supplies outdoor customer premise equipment to the us direct broadcast satellite dbs market 
in march  effective at the beginning of fiscal  the company split its products division into two separate reporting segments the satellite division and the wireless datacom division 
the satellite division consists of the company s dbs business  and the wireless datacom division consists of calamp s legacy wireless businesses other than dbs and the businesses acquired as described below 
segment information presented in this form k for the years ended february  and has been reclassified to present information on this new reporting segment basis 
the solutions division  the remaining operations of which were sold in august  is presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
wireless datacom division the wireless datacom division services the public safety  industrial monitoring and controls  and mobile resource management market segments with wireless solutions that extend communications networks to field applications  thereby enabling coordination of emergency response teams  increasing productivity and optimizing workflow for the mobile workforce  improving management controls over valuable remote assets  and enabling novel applications in a connected world 
the wireless datacom division is comprised of the company s legacy wireless businesses other than dbs and businesses acquired during the last two years 
these principal acquisitions are described below  and further details are provided in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on may  the company acquired privately held dataradio inc  a leading supplier of proprietary advanced mobile and fixed wireless data communication systems  products  and solutions for public safety  critical infrastructure and industrial control applications  for a cash payment of canadian million  or us million at the effective exchange rate 
the dataradio acquisition expanded calamp s wireless data communications business while furthering the company s strategic goals of diversifying its customer base and expanding its product offerings into higher margin growth markets 
in connection with the acquisition of dataradio the company recorded a charge of  for in process research and development costs of the acquired business as part of the purchase price allocation 
dataradio became part of the company s wireless datacom division 
also on may   the company acquired the mobile resource management product line from privately held technocom corporation 
this product line is used to help track fleets of cars and trucks 
these location monitoring units communicate via public ie cellular wireless networks and are distributed on an oem basis to application service providers and system integrators offering mobile resource management solutions 
in addition  the business offers a backend device management system to minimize support and service costs and also sophisticated unit firmware providing a greater range of vehicle information and communication capabilities 
the purchase price for this acquisition was million in cash and an earn out payment equal to revenues in excess of  during the month period following the acquisition 
the company made earn out payments of  during fiscal  leaving a balance of million that is included in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at february  the company expects to pay the remaining balance plus interest at over the next months using cash flows generated from operations 
on march   the company acquired aercept formerly known as aircept  a vehicle tracking business  from airiq inc  a canadian company  for cash consideration of million 
the source of funds for the purchase price was the company s cash on hand 
aercept s business involves the sale of end to end hosted asset tracking services to vehicle lenders that specialize in automobile financing for high credit risk individuals 
aercept s products utilize global positioning satellite gps and cellular technology to provide up to date location and tracking information 
aercept  which has approximately employees  became part of the company s wireless datacom division 
on april   the company acquired the business and substantially all the assets of smartlink radio networks  a privately held company  for cash consideration of million 
the source of funds for the purchase price was the company s cash on hand 
smartlink provides proprietary interoperable radio communications platforms and integration services for public safety and critical infrastructure applications 
smartlink s software defined switch provides interoperability with legacy analog wireless communications networks without the need to replace the installed base of land mobile radios 
smartlink became part of the company s new wireless datacom division 
smartlink s operations were integrated into calamp s facilities in montreal  canada and atlanta  georgia 
satellite division the company s dbs reception products are sold primarily to the two us dbs system operators  echostar and directv  for incorporation into complete subscription satellite television systems 
prior to fiscal  the company s overall revenue consisted principally of sales of satellite television outdoor reception equipment for the us dbs industry  which accounted for and of consolidated revenue in fiscal years and  respectively 
in fiscal  as the result of a dbs product performance issue as described below  one of the company s dbs customers substantially reduced its purchases of the company s products 
for this reason  sales of dbs products accounted for only of consolidated revenues for fiscal the dbs system operators have approximately share of the total subscription television market in the us in calendar  the size of the us dbs market grew by from million subscribers to approximately million subscribers at december  during fiscal  the company received notification from one of its dbs customers of a field performance issue with a dbs product that the company began shipping in september after examining the various component parts used in the manufacture of these products  it was determined by the company that the performance issue was the result of a deterioration of the printed circuit board pcb laminate material used in these products 
from the time the problem was isolated to the pcb laminate material until march  the company worked with the supplier of the laminate material and with the dbs customer to identify a corrective action 
notwithstanding these efforts  on march  the laminate supplier filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the state of massachusetts in which it claimed that it is not responsible for the field performance issue of these dbs products 
on may   the company filed a lawsuit against the pcb laminate supplier in the us district court for the central district of california for negligence  strict product liability  intentional misrepresentation and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage  among other causes of action 
calamp expects to vigorously pursue all legal options to recover its damages from that supplier 
during fiscal  the dbs customer returned approximately  units to the company for analysis and rework 
an additional  units were returned by this customer during fiscal  and it is anticipated that additional units could be returned to the company during fiscal in addition to returning product  in may this dbs customer put on hold all orders for calamp products  including newer generation products  pending the requalification of all products manufactured by the company for this customer 
during the fiscal fourth quarter  calamp increased its reserve for accrued warranty costs by  for this matter 
this amount was predicated on the customer accepting a planned corrective action procedure for the previous generation products that calamp had developed for existing and projected future product returns 
under this planned corrective action  calamp expected that the field performance issue could be resolved by retuning the circuitry as a lower cost alternative to replacing certain parts and materials 
prior to the issuance of its financial statements for the fiscal first quarter  the company learned that the dbs customer would not accept the company s proposed rework approach for the previous generation products that involved retuning the circuitry 
this led the company to conclude that certain parts  including the radio frequency board assembly  would need to be replaced  which is a significantly more costly process 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of million in the quarter ended may  to increase the reserves for this matter 
the resulting loss caused an event of default with respect to the financial covenants under the company s bank credit agreement  as discussed further under liquidity and capital resources below 
during the remainder of fiscal  the company recorded additional charges of million related to this matter 
total fiscal charges of million related to this matter are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
at november   the company had reserves in the aggregate amount of million for this matter 
the company reached a settlement agreement with this customer in december as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  the company agreed to rework certain dbs products previously returned to the company or to be returned over a month period and will provide extended warranty periods for workmanship months and product failures due to the issue with the pcb laminate material months 
in addition  as part of the settlement the company issued to the customer a million non interest bearing note payable  a million credit against outstanding receivables due from the customer   shares of common stock and  common stock purchase warrants exercisable at per share for three years 
the note is repayable at a rate of per unit on the first  dbs units purchased by the customer after the date of the settlement agreement 
the consideration issued by the company under the settlement agreement reduced the reserves by million 
at february   the company had total reserves of million for this matter  plus the million note payable 
while calamp believes that its established reserves as of february  will be adequate to cover the total costs of this settlement agreement  including future product rework costs  no assurances can be given that the ultimate expenses will not materially increase from the current estimate 
the cash impact of these reserves is anticipated to occur over two or three years 
solutions division the company s acquisition of vytek corporation vytek in april gave rise to goodwill of approximately million 
in accordance with the applicable accounting rules  the goodwill of million was apportioned between calamp s solutions division and products division because both divisions were expected to benefit from the acquisition 
the apportionment analysis resulted in allocating million of the goodwill to the products division and the remaining million to the solutions division 
as a result of the fiscal annual impairment test of the solutions division goodwill conducted as of april   the company determined that there was an impairment of goodwill  and accordingly  an impairment charge was recorded in fiscal in the amount of  in addition  the company recorded an  impairment charge related to the other intangible assets arising from the vytek acquisition 
the impairment charges reflected the declining revenues associated with the solutions division s information technology professional consulting business  due primarily to the inability of the solutions division to generate new recurring revenue streams to grow the business 
the company sold the telalert software business of the solutions division to a privately held company on august  for total consideration of million  consisting of million in cash  a non interest bearing note with present value of million and preferred stock of the acquirer valued at million 
the note is payable in equal monthly installments of  which commenced december  the company recognized a pre tax gain of million on the sale of the telalert software business 
the income tax expense attributable to the gain was million because at the time of sale there was goodwill of million associated with this business that was not deductible for income tax purposes 
the telalert software business was the remaining business of the solutions division 
operating results for the solutions division have been presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a discontinued operation  as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the solutions division goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal described above in the aggregate amount of  are included in the loss from operations of discontinued operations  net of tax in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended february  critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments are made include  but are not limited to the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  product warranties  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  and the valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for estimated bad debts based upon a review and evaluation of specific customer accounts identified as known and expected collection problems  based on historical experience  or due to insolvency or other collection issues 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company s customer base is quite concentrated  with three customers accounting for of the company s fiscal sales 
changes in either a key customer s financial position  or the economy as a whole  could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the recorded allowance amount 
inventories the company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices 
to the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed the associated carrying values  inventory carrying amounts are written down 
in addition  the company generally treats inventory on hand or committed with suppliers  which is not expected to be sold within the next months  as excess and thus appropriate write downs of the inventory carrying amounts are established through a charge to cost of sales 
estimated usage in the next months is based on demand represented by orders in backlog and management estimate of sales forecast at the end of the quarter  giving consideration to customers forecasted demand  ordering patterns and product life cycles 
significant reductions in product pricing  or changes in technology and or demand may necessitate additional write downs of inventory carrying value in the future 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  at february  the company had an inventory reserve of million that was established during fiscal in connection with a product performance issue involving a key dbs customer 
also as described in note  the company had on hand inventory of million and outstanding purchase commitments of million for materials that are specific to the products that the company manufactures for this customer 
these amounts are not currently reserved for because the company believes these materials can be used in the ordinary course of business as future shipments of products are made to this customer 
nonetheless  changes in the forecasted product demand from this customer could require that the inventory reserve and or the reserve for vendor commitment liabilities be increased to cover some portion of these amounts 
product warranties the company initially provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while it engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  at february  the company had a million reserve for accrued warranty costs in connection with a product performance issue involving a key dbs customer 
while the company believes that this warranty reserve will be adequate to cover total future product rework costs under this settlement agreement  no assurances can be given that the ultimate costs will not materially differ from the current estimate 
deferred income tax valuation allowance deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized if realization of such asset is more likely than not  based upon the weight of available evidence that includes historical operating performance and the company s forecast of future operating performance 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred income tax asset on a quarterly basis  and a valuation allowance is provided  as necessary  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
during this evaluation  the company reviews its forecasts of income in conjunction with the positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred income tax asset to determine if a valuation allowance is needed 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for income tax uncertainties fin 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities 
fin provides guidance on the de recognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
the company adopted fin at the beginning of the fiscal first quarter 
as a result of adopting fin  the company i increased deferred income tax assets and income taxes payable by million each  and ii increased income taxes receivable and reduced goodwill by million each 
at february   the company had an aggregate deferred tax asset balance of million 
the current portion of this deferred tax asset is million and the noncurrent portion is million 
the noncurrent portion of the deferred income tax assets is comprised primarily of the tax benefit associated with the net operating losses incurred during fiscal and prior years 
the company also has deferred tax assets for canadian income tax purposes arising from the acquisition of dataradio amounting to million at february   which relate primarily to research and development tax credits for canadian federal and quebec provincial income taxes 
of this total canadian deferred tax assets amount  million existed at the time of the dataradio acquisition in may and million arose subsequent to the acquisition 
the company has provided a valuation allowance against these canadian deferred tax assets at february  reflecting the company s belief that it is more likely than not that the associated tax benefit will not be realized 
if in the future a portion or all of the million valuation allowance for the canadian deferred tax assets is no longer deemed to be necessary  reductions of the valuation allowance up to million will decrease the goodwill balance associated with the dataradio acquisition  and reductions of the valuation allowance in excess of million will reduce the income tax provision 
impairment assessments of goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets at february   the company had million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets on its balance sheet 
the company believes the estimate of its valuation of long lived assets and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because if circumstances arose that led to a decrease in the valuation it could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company makes judgments about the recoverability of non goodwill intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on the balance sheet may exist 
the company tests the impairment of goodwill annually and  in certain situations  on an interim basis if indicators of impairment arise 
goodwill of the satellite division and wireless datacom division is tested annually for impairment as of december each year 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value  goodwill would be evaluated for impairment between annual tests 
management has appropriate processes in place to monitor for interim triggering events 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  the company typically makes various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  considers market factors specific to that business and estimates future cash flows to be generated by that business 
the company must make estimates and judgments about the adequacy of reserves established for the product performance issue with a key dbs customer as described above 
these assumptions and estimates are necessarily subjective and based on management s best estimates based on limited information 
based on these assumptions and estimates  the company determines whether it needs to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on the balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in the company s business strategy and its internal forecasts 
although management believes the assumptions and estimates that have been made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the company s reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges  which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on the balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges  higher net income and higher asset values 
as a result of the solutions division goodwill impairment test conducted as of april   the company recorded an impairment charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal the solutions division goodwill impairment test conducted as of april   which utilized a market based approach to determine fair value  indicated that no impairment existed as of that date 
the company sold the telalert software business of the solutions division in august which resulted in the discontinuation of the operations of the solutions division 
see note acquisitions and discontinued operation for further discussion 
as a result of a product performance issue with a key dbs customer  as described above  the dbs customer substantially reduced its purchases of the company s products during fiscal revenues with this customer declined from million in the nine months ended november  to million in the nine months ended november  in addition  the company s market capitalization declined substantially after the public announcement of the issue with the key dbs customer and continued to decline through the third quarter ended november  and at that date was significantly lower than the carrying value of the company s consolidated net assets 
the company believes that the decline in its market capitalization during the third quarter was primarily attributable to the uncertainty surrounding the interruption of its commercial relationship with this key customer 
although the company reached a settlement agreement with this customer in december  the company s market capitalization remained significantly below the carrying value of its consolidated net assets 
phase i of the impairment test conducted as of november  indicated that the carrying value of net assets of the satellite division and the wireless datacom division exceeded the fair values of these reporting units by  and  respectively 
the fair values were determined using discounted cash flow dcf analyses of financial projections for each reporting unit 
the satellite division dcf reflected the reduced revenue from the key dbs customer  the company s best estimate of forecasted revenues  profitability and cash flows over the next several years  and a market based discount rate reflecting the perceived risk premium in the market 
the phase ii impairment analysis involves a revaluation of all net assets  both tangible and intangible  and in the case of intangible assets  both recognized and unrecognized 
phase ii of the impairment analysis indicated additional impairment losses for the satellite and wireless datacom divisions of  and  respectively 
accordingly  an aggregate charge of  was recorded in fiscal for the goodwill impairment losses for the satellite and wireless datacom divisions of  and  respectively 
the principal reasons for the impairment of the satellite division goodwill are i the interruption of the commercial relationship with a key customer that substantially reduced the revenue and operating profitability of this division  and ii the sustained decline in the company s market capitalization 
with respect to the wireless datacom division  despite the fact that the revenue and gross profit of this business were higher in the current three and nine month periods than the comparable periods of the prior year  this reporting unit was also determined to be impaired 
this is because in calculating the fair values of the company s two reporting units using a dcf method  the company employed a higher cost of capital in the november  impairment analysis compared to previous analyses as a result of the current assessment of risk  which took into consideration the company s overall liquidity constraints at the present time 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the sales price is probable 
in cases where terms of sale include subjective customer acceptance criteria  revenue is deferred until the acceptance criteria are met 
critical judgments made by management related to revenue recognition include the determination of whether or not customer acceptance criteria are perfunctory or inconsequential 
the determination of whether or not the customer acceptance terms are perfunctory or inconsequential impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized 
critical judgments also include estimates of warranty reserves  which are established based on historical experience and knowledge of the product 
products sold in connection with service contracts are recorded as deferred revenues and the associated product costs are recorded as deferred costs 
these deferred amounts are recognized over the life of the service contract on a straight line basis 
the company also undertakes projects that include the design  development and manufacture of public safety communication systems that are specially customized to customers specifications or that involve fixed site construction 
sales under such contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
costs and estimated revenues are recorded as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs utilizing the most recent estimates of costs 
if the current contract estimate indicates a loss  provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
critical estimates made by management related to revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method include the estimation of costs at completion and the determination of the overall margin rate on the specific project

the operating loss of million for that period also includes a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the wireless datacom division operating loss of million in fiscal includes a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the wireless datacom division operating loss of million in fiscal includes a charge of million to write off in process research and development costs associated with the dataradio acquisition 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year as further discussed under the caption basis of presentation above  fiscal years and contained weeks and weeks  respectively  as a result of the company s week fiscal year method 
the company believes that the inclusion of the one additional week in fiscal does not materially affect the comparability of the operating results between these two periods 
revenue satellite division revenue declined million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decline was primarily attributable to the action taken by a key dbs customer to put on hold all orders with the company  including orders for newer generation products  pending a requalification of all products manufactured by calamp for this customer and a review of production processes 
revenues from this customer in fiscal were million lower than in fiscal the company reached a settlement agreement with this customer in december as further described in note the company expects to resume shipments to this customer in the fiscal first quarter 
wireless datacom division revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to fiscal due to i an million increase in sales of radio modules to a wireless datacom customer in support of that customer s contract with the us department of defense  ii the acquisition of aercept in march  which contributed revenue of million in fiscal  and the fact that the operations of dataradio and the technocom mrm business are included for all weeks of fiscal versus only weeks of fiscal gross profit and gross margins the satellite division had negative gross profit of million for fiscal compared with a gross profit of for fiscal the decline in gross profit is primarily attributable to the million charge for estimated expenses to correct a product performance issue with a key dbs customer and the million decline in revenue in fiscal compared to the prior year 
gross profit of the wireless datacom division increased to million for fiscal compared to million last year  which is commensurate with the revenue increase of this division 
wireless datacom s gross margin decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal due to a change in product mix  primarily due to the acquisition at the beginning of fiscal of aercept  which is currently operating at lower gross margins than the other businesses within the wireless datacom businesses 
see also note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional operating data by business segment 
operating expenses consolidated research and development r d expense increased by million to million for fiscal from million last year  primarily from higher r d expenses of dataradio 
dataradio s r d expense accounted for million of the increase  offset by a reduction in r d expense associated with the company s satellite division and the wireless datacom division s oem business 
dataradio was included for all weeks of the fiscal period and only weeks of the fiscal period 
consolidated selling expenses increased by million to million for fiscal year from million last year 
this increase is primarily due to higher selling expenses of dataradio and aercept  which accounted for million and million of the increase  respectively 
as noted above  dataradio was included for all weeks of the fiscal period versus only weeks of the fiscal period  and aercept was acquired in march consolidated general and administrative expenses g a increased by million for fiscal  which increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of dataradio in may  aercept in march and smartlink in april  which collectively accounted for increased g a of million for fiscal compared to last year 
amortization of intangibles increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of aercept and smartlink 
the in process research and development ipr d write off declined from million for fiscal to  for fiscal last year s ipr d write off was related to the acquisition of dataradio  while this year s ipr d write off was related to the acquisition of smartlink 
the ipr d of million in fiscal is further described in note acquisitions and discontinued operations 
operating loss the operating loss for fiscal was million  compared to operating income of million for fiscal the operating loss in the current period is attributable to the impairment charge of million  the million charge for the dbs product performance issue noted above  and the reduction in gross profit due to the million decline in revenues from a key dbs customer 
non operating income expense  net non operating expense for fiscal was  for fiscal  compared to non operating income of  for fiscal the change was primarily due to i an increase in net interest expense of  because of lower invested cash and higher debt in fiscal  ii  in foreign currency loss in the current year compared to a  gain last year  and iii a gain of  last year on currency hedging activities in connection with the dataradio acquisition  for which the purchase price was denominated in canadian dollars

the effective income tax rate in fiscal of was impacted by nondeductible goodwill of million while the in fiscal was impacted by in process research and development expense of million 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue satellite division revenue decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decline in revenue is attributable to a decrease in unit sales volume of approximately from fiscal to fiscal  partially offset by an increase in average selling prices per unit of approximately
