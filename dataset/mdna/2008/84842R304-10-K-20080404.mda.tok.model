item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview prior to august   the company operated via two principal segments  infospherix and biospherix 
biospherix develops proprietary products for commercial applications 
infospherix provided contact center information and reservations services for government and industry 
on august   the company sold infospherix 
the sale allows spherix to focus substantially all of its efforts on the biospherix division s biotechnology products  with the principal focus on the commercialization of naturlose as a drug for type diabetes 
the historical operations of infospherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations 
biospherix engages in product development  notably tagatose 
the company s current focus is on the non food use of tagatose  which we will market under the name naturlose 
our principal efforts have been to explore whether naturlose is an effective treatment for type diabetes 
in april  the company commenced a phase clinical trial under an fda investigational new drug ind application process for this purpose 
as a result  the company expects to incur substantial development costs in the next few years  without any substantial corresponding revenue 
in july  the company started a new business when it entered into the health sciences consulting business to provide technical and regulatory consulting services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as aiding the company s own r d activities 
results of operations compared with revenue and direct costs the revenue and direct contract costs primarily relate to the new health sciences consulting business launched in july we generally provide our services on either a fixed price basis or on a time and expenses basis  charging hourly rates for each staff member involved in a project  based on his or her skills and experience 
our engagement agreements typically provide for monthly billing  require payment of our invoices within thirty days of receipt  and permit clients to terminate engagements at any time 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for continuing operations for the year ended increased million over those of the same periods in the increase between years is the result of a number of factors including increased accounting costs  legal fees  executive bonus and consulting costs  as well as certain costs such as insurance that were previously allocated over both entities before the august th sale of infospherix  and that are now charged fully to spherix 
excluded from the above are costs directly related to the discontinued segment 
research and development the company s r d expenditures have significantly increased between years as a direct result of the company s phase clinical trial in the use of naturlose for the treatment of type diabetes  which began in the phase trial has been the primary focus of biospherix s r d activities for the year ended december  the first participants began the phase clinical trial in april more than subjects  representing the demographic mix in the us  will receive oral doses of naturlose to test its ability to treat type diabetes and an equal amount will receive a placebo 
a phase clinical trial  which gathers evidence regarding efficacy and safety  is needed to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of new drugs proposed to the fda 
the company believes its chances for a successful outcome are enhanced by the widely demonstrated safety of the product 
testing is scheduled to finish near the end of at the earliest 
if the trial is successful  it will likely take several months to compile the data and submit a new drug application nda to the fda 
the fda will then likely take up to a year to respond to the nda 
accordingly  we do not expect fda approval before the end of at the earliest 
a smaller trial  contracted with the university of maryland school of dentistry  to conduct a human clinical trial on the oral anti plaque efficacy of naturlose  was also undertaken earlier this year and completed in july 
initial results of the university of maryland trial indicated no statistical significance and the company will not pursue further anti plaque efficacy research 
interest income the increase in interest income is a direct result of the proceeds from the sale of infospherix  which increased the company s cash and cash equivalents balances 
income tax the company s net tax expense was  in and consisted of million allocated to continuing operations as a tax benefit and million charged to discontinued operations as a tax expense 
for  the company s net tax expense was  and consisted of million allocated to continuing operations as a tax benefit and million charged to discontinued operations as a tax expense 
discontinued operations on august   the company completed the sale of infospherix for million million at closing and million following a month escrow period  pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated june  the million sale proceeds were included in the gain on sale of the discontinued segment at the time of closing in august the million escrow balance  less any conditional offsets  will be recorded as a gain on sale of the discontinued segment when and if realized in november the infospherix segment comprised the majority of the company s operations prior to the sale 
the sale will allow spherix to focus substantially all of its efforts on the biospherix division s biotechnology products  with the principal focus on the commercialization of naturlose 
in october  the company agreed to a million settlement to end its longstanding legal dispute with the us department of agriculture over the government s award of the national recreation reservation service nrrs contract to a competitor of infospherix 
this amount is reported as other income of the discontinued segment 
the results of operations of the discontinued infospherix segment  including the costs to sell the segment  are as follows revenue direct cost and operating expense selling  general and administrative expense interest revenue interest expense other income gain on sale of segment income from discontinued operations before taxes sales backlog the company s backlog as of december   from the new health sciences consulting business was approximately  critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses for the period reported 
estimates are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates are evaluated periodically and form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
spherix s critical accounting policies are those it believes are the most important in determining its financial condition and results  and require significant subjective judgment by management as a result of inherent uncertainties 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
such policies are discussed below 
accounting for taxes and valuation allowances we currently have significant deferred tax assets  resulting from net operating loss carry forwards 
these deferred tax assets may reduce taxable income in future periods 
based on the company s losses and its accumulated deficit  the company has provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment of valuation allowances 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
long lived assets and other intangible assets long lived assets and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset s use and eventual disposition 
new accounting pronouncements the company adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin on january  the company recognized no adjustments related to the implementation fin the company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties on tax liabilities as interest expense 
at january  and december   the company had no unrecognized income tax benefits and recognized no interest or penalties on income tax liabilities 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we are required to adopt sfas effective january   with the exception of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
the effective date of these items has been deferred to fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material affect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the fair value option may be applied  subject to certain exceptions  on an instrument by instrument basis  is irrevocable  and is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements in accounting for business combinations 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  in march  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material affect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources on june   as part of the sale of infospherix  the company closed its line of credit with the bank 
accordingly  we are operating our biospherix efforts solely from the net proceeds we received from the sale of infospherix 
the newly launched health sciences business is not expected to generate any substantial positive cash flow in the next twelve months 
working capital as of december   was million  which represents a million increase from working capital at december  the increase in working capital is directly related to the million proceeds from the sale of infospherix less the company s operating costs  which included approximately million for the company s r d activities 
spherix expects to expend approximately million over the next year in costs related to the phase clinical trial and other r d activity 
the clinical trial is expected to be completed near the end of at the earliest 
the company intends to finance the biospherix activities through proceeds from the sale of infospherix 
while the company completes its phase trial  it will be taking other steps to prepare for commercialization of naturlose as a treatment for type diabetes on the assumption that the trials will be successful 
these steps include additional dose range testing  exploring manufacturing alternatives and seeking marketing assistance 
the company s goal remains to attempt to attract a pharmaceutical company to purchase or license the technology at the earliest practicable stage 
in the event the company needs additional funds  it may seek other financing  including possible sale of additional shares of its common stock 
the company is investigating growing its health sciences consulting business by adding professional personnel and or acquiring another consulting business 
given the limited resources available to the company  and the expected costs of the ongoing biotechnology efforts  the company will likely explore debt financing for any such expansion efforts 
cash flow for the year ended december   reflects a net cash inflow of million  consisting of million used in operating activities  million provided by investing activities  and  provided by financing activities 
the increase in cash used by operating activities of the continuing operations in from that of the prior year is primarily related to the cost of the phase clinical trial 
the change in cash provided by investing activities is directly related to the proceeds from the sale of infospherix 
cash flows from financing activities in reflect proceeds from an a standby equity distribution agreement seda which has been terminated and is no longer available 
continued progress on the clinical trial of naturlose as a treatment of type diabetes and on the other initiatives described above is dependent upon many factors including  but not limited to  the company having sufficient funds and resources 
the total cost of completing the phase trial is difficult to determine and can be affected by a number of factors  including successful restructuring of the oversight responsibilities and completion of the study in a timely manner 
although it cannot be certain  the company s current funds on hand may be sufficient for it to complete the study and are believed to be sufficient to meet all of the company s short term obligations  as a result  management does not at present intend to raise additional funds through the capital markets unless necessary 
the company also believes that  if raising additional funds at some point becomes desirable  the ideal timing for this would be after the company has obtained results from the dose range study or additional information from the market research 
trends and outlooks costs of conducting the phase trial have substantially increased as we have obtained further direction from the fda concerning the processes to be employed in the trial 
we have undertaken certain dose range  marketing and manufacturing studies analyses to increase our chances of attracting a purchaser licensee 
the company expects to spend approximately million in r d costs over the next year 
the company is currently evaluating the performance of certain contractors performing our phase clinical trial 
we are attempting to minimize further delays in the phase trial and to further reduce the cost of the phase trial 
on august   the company closed on the sale of infospherix for million 
the company received million at closing and will receive million following a month escrow period  assuming no indemnification claims 
in conjunction with the august  closing  noted above  richard c 
levin  chief executive officer  president and chief financial officer resigned from the company  and claire l 
kruger was elected as the new chief executive officer and chief operating officer 
with the addition of claire l 
kruger to the company  spherix has launched a health sciences consulting business line to provide technical and regulatory consulting services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as aiding the company s own r d activities 
the company has relocated its corporate headquarters to a smaller facility in bethesda  maryland 
we will continue to search for a purchaser licensee of naturlose as a prospective type diabetes drug
