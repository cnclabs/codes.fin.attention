item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative treatments for infectious diseases 
within the anti infective market  we are currently concentrating on the development of antivirals and antibacterials 
we are targeting our antiviral development efforts on treatments for hiv infection and chronic hepatitis c  and we are directing our antibacterial development efforts toward treatments for serious hospital based bacterial infections 
we have devoted and are continuing to devote substantially all of our efforts toward product research and development 
we have incurred losses of million from inception through december  and had an accumulated deficit of million through december  our net losses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have funded our operations primarily through proceeds of million from the sale of equity securities  including our initial public offering in october  borrowings of million from debt facilities  and receipts of million from up front and milestone payments  as well as million in cost sharing receipts  from our collaboration partner  gilead sciences 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years as we seek to complete the open label extension phases of our phase ii clinical trials for elvucitabine  complete assessment of ach preclinical data and prepare for early clinical testing  complete ind enabling preclinical testing of ach  advance our hcv protease inhibitor  for chronic hepatitis c infection  and progress additional drug candidates 
we will need substantial additional financing to obtain regulatory approvals  fund operating losses  and  if deemed appropriate  establish manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities  which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
in addition to the normal risks associated with early stage companies  there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete our research and development  obtain adequate patent protection for our technology  obtain necessary government regulatory approval for drug candidates we develop or that any approved drug candidates will be commercially viable 
in addition  we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing any of our drug candidates 
financial operations overview revenue to date  we have not generated revenue from the sale of any drugs 
the majority of our revenue recognized to date has been derived from our collaboration with gilead sciences to develop compounds for use in treating chronic hepatitis c 
during the years ended december   and we recognized million  million and million  respectively  under this collaboration agreement 
upon initiating our collaboration with gilead sciences  we received a payment of million  which included an equity investment by gilead sciences determined to be worth approximately million 
the remaining million is being accounted for as a nonrefundable up front fee recognized under the proportionate 
table of contents performance model 
revenue under the proportionate performance model is recognized as our effort under the collaboration is incurred 
when our performance obligation is complete  we will recognize milestone payments  if any  when the corresponding milestone is achieved 
we will recognize royalty payments  if any  upon product sales 
research and development expenses under our collaboration with gilead sciences  including internal full time equivalent costs and external research costs  incurred by both companies prior to proof of concept  were borne equally by both parties through march  as we were providing the majority of those services and are incurring the majority of those expenses  we are the net recipient of funds under this cost sharing portion of the arrangement and therefore recognize the reimbursed costs as revenue rather than research expense 
payments made by us to gilead sciences in connection with this collaboration are being recognized as a reduction of revenue 
effective april   internal full time equivalent costs will no longer be subject to this cost sharing arrangement 
instead  each party will provide for the costs of their own full time equivalents 
we expect that the relative full time equivalent efforts of each of achillion and gilead sciences will remain approximately one half of total efforts 
we will continue to equally share external research costs with gilead sciences 
we have also recognized revenue under a small business innovation research  or sbir  grant by the national institutes of health  or nih  related to our hiv capsid research program 
during the years ended december   and we recognized   and  respectively  in revenue under this grant 
efforts under our small business innovation research  or sbir  grant were completed in the first quarter of no additional grant revenue related to this grant will be recognized 
research and development our research and development expenses reflect costs incurred for our proprietary research and development projects as well as costs for research and development projects conducted as part of collaborative arrangements we establish 
these costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our research and development personnel  costs of services by clinical research organizations  other outsourced research  materials used during research and development activities  facility related costs such as rent and utilities associated with our laboratory and clinical development space  operating supplies and other costs associated with our research and development activities 
we expect that over the next twelve months research and development expenses will decrease somewhat due to several factors  most notably the near completion of the phase ii clinical program for elvucitabine  the major expenses for which will not recur  and the lesser levels of expenses related to earlier stage ind enabling testing for ach and our hcv protease inhibitors 
all costs associated with internal research and development  and research and development services for which we have externally contracted  are expensed as incurred 
our research and development expenses are outlined in the table below 
for the years ended in thousands direct external costs elvucitabine ach nsa antagonists including ach and ach direct internal personnel costs sub total direct costs indirect costs and overhead total research and development 
table of contents currently  we are completing the open label extension phases of two phase ii clinical trials for elvucitabine  conducting preclinical studies for ach  and performing late discovery stage toxicology assessments of our hcv protease inhibitors 
from the inception of each respective program through december   we incurred approximately million in total costs for elvucitabine  approximately million in total costs for our nsa antagonist program including both ach and ach and approximately million in total costs for ach these figures include our internal research and development personnel costs and related facilities overhead 
we currently estimate that the clinical trial costs for two phase iii clinical trials of elvucitabine in different hiv populations will be approximately million  exclusive of the internal personnel costs associated with conducting these trials 
we currently plan to enter a collaboration arrangement which would offset a significant portion of these costs 
we estimate that the costs associated with completing phase i clinical trials with ach will be approximately million  exclusive of the internal personnel costs associated with conducting these studies and trials 
we anticipate that the costs associated with preclinical and early clinical development through proof of concept of ach  our next generation nsa antagonist  will be approximately million  exclusive of internal personnel costs 
this amount for nsa represents one half of the external costs associated with those activities  as we share such external costs with gilead sciences 
we estimate that the costs associated with preclinical and early clinical development of one of our hcv protease inhibitors to be approximately million 
the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our drug candidates 
we are also unable to predict when  if ever  material net cash inflows will commence from elvucitabine or any early stage programs 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the potential benefits of our drug candidates over other therapies  in the case of our hcv inhibitors involving nsa antagonism  the rate at which our collaboration partner  gilead sciences  is able to complete pre clinical and clinical trials  and the degree to which gilead sciences prioritizes those trials over its other development efforts  our ability to market  commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our drug candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the expense and timing of regulatory approvals  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate 
for example  if the fda or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required to complete clinical development of a drug candidate  or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
we expect expenses associated with the completion of these programs to be substantial and increase 
we do not believe  however  that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program specific expenses through commercialization 
there exist numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates  including future trial design and various regulatory requirements  many of which cannot be 
table of contents determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development 
additionally  future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will evolve and therefore impact our clinical development programs and plans over time 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for management and administrative personnel  professional fees for legal  accounting and other services  travel costs and facility related costs such as rent  utilities and other general office expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will remain substantially unchanged over the next twelve months  but may increase in the future due to increased payroll  expanded infrastructure  increased consulting  legal  accounting and investor relations expenses associated with being a public company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth below are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management makes estimates and exercises judgment in revenue recognition  research and development costs  stock based compensation and accrued expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue from contract research and development and research progress payments in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  or sab  and financial accounting standards board  or fasb  emerging issue task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf revenue generating research and development collaborations are often multiple element arrangements  providing for a license as well as research and development services 
such arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  including research and development services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf we recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have standalone value or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the upfront license payments are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when our performance obligations are performed 
when we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue related to upfront license payments will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a proportionate performance or 
table of contents straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
under the proportionate performance method  periodic revenue related to up front license payments is recognized as the percentage of actual effort expended in that period to total effort expected for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
actual effort is generally determined based upon actual direct labor hours or full time equivalents incurred and include research and development activities performed by internal scientists 
total expected effort is generally based upon the total direct labor hours of full time equivalents incorporated into the detailed budget and project plan that is agreed to by both parties to the collaboration 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete the related performance obligations 
the joint research committee periodically reviews and updates the project plan  the most recent review took place in december in the event that a change in estimate occurs  the change will be accounted for using the cumulative catch up method which provides for an adjustment to revenue in the current period 
estimates of our level of effort may change in the future  resulting in a material change in the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
we revised our joint research program with gilead sciences in the first quarter of to focus on next generation nsa antagonists 
at that time  we extended the period over which our remaining obligations under the arrangement would be completed 
in addition  we and gilead sciences agreed to continue to equally share external costs  but effective april   internal full time equivalents would no longer be subject to this cost sharing arrangement 
instead  each party would bear the costs of their respective full time equivalents 
generally under collaboration arrangements  payments received during the period of performance may include up front payments  time or performance based milestones and reimbursement of internal and external costs 
the proportion of actual performance to total expected performance is applied to these payments in determining periodic revenue  but will be limited by the aggregate cash received or receivable to date by the company 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance bonuses that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone and a reasonable amount of time passes between the upfront license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment the substantive milestone method 
reimbursement of costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of eitf issue no 
are met  the amounts are determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation employee stock based awards through december   we accounted for grants of stock options and restricted stock utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principle board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and  accordingly  recognized no compensation expense for an option when the option had an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value at the date of grant 
under apb  compensation expense was computed to the extent that fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant exceeded the exercise price of the employee stock option or stock award 
compensation so computed was then recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
also through december   we had adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 

table of contents effective january   we adopted the statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r  which requires measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases under our espp plan based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes our previous method of accounting under apb in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab providing supplemental guidance for sfas r implementation 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
we primarily grant qualified stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the market value of the shares at the date of grant 
to the extent that the amount of the aggregate fair market value of qualified stock options that become exercisable for an individual exceeds  during any tax year  those stock options are treated as non qualified stock options 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is based on the value of the portion of stock based awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the years ended december  and includes compensation expense for stock based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the fair value on the grant date estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas compensation expense also includes amounts related to the stock based awards granted subsequent to december   based on the fair value on the grant date  estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
upon adoption of sfas r  we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the black scholes model requires the use of assumptions which determine the fair value of the stock based awards 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  we previously accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
in accordance with sfas r  we are required to estimate forfeitures at the grant date and recognize compensation costs for only those awards that are expected to vest 
judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under sfas r 
there is risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may differ from the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with sfas r and sab using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
total compensation expense recorded in the accompanying statements of operations associated with option grants made to employees for the years ended december  and was million and  we recorded no tax benefit related to these options since we currently maintain a full valuation allowance 
as of december   the total compensation cost related to nonvested options not yet recognized in the financial statements is approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures  and the weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized is years 
as of december   the intrinsic value of the options outstanding was million  of which million related to vested options and  related to unvested options 

table of contents accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have begun to be incurred or we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with gaap 
results of operations results of operations may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors  including the timing of payments received under existing or future strategic alliances  joint ventures or financings  if any  the progress of our research and development projects  technological advances and determinations as to the commercial potential of proposed products 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue in is primarily due to lower revenue in resulting from a significant change in estimate of our remaining performance obligations as of december   under our collaboration with gilead 
in february  we discontinued further development of ach we also revised our research program with gilead to focus on next generation nsa antagonists 
additionally  our efforts under the collaboration  which were previously estimated to be complete in march  were extended through mid in march  we and gilead sciences agreed to continue to equally share external costs  but effective april   internal full time equivalents would no longer be subject to this cost sharing arrangement 
instead  each party would bear the costs of their respective full time equivalents 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a reduction of revenue under the cumulative catch up method to reflect our proportionate performance through december  this adjustment reflected our increased remaining performance obligations  which effectively reduced the proportion of our performance obligations that had been completed to date 
revenue consisted of the following years ended december  change in thousands gilead collaboration revenue grant revenue total revenue through the completion of our performance obligations in  we expect to recognize additional revenue of approximately million  offset by any payments we are obligated to make to gilead in satisfaction of external costs paid by gilead under our external cost sharing agreement 
it is possible that we will recognize negative revenue in future quarters based upon the timing of our performance under the collaboration  and on the timing and magnitude of external costs borne by gilead 

table of contents research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

the amount of tax benefit we recognized in connection with this exchange program was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the  increase from to is due to an overall increase in eligible research and development costs for the year  resulting primarily from the lack of reimbursement for internal full time equivalent costs from gilead sciences  under our amended agreement which became effective april   combined with an increase in clinical trial costs 
the reimbursement previously received by gilead reduced the amount of research and development expense eligible for the tax credit

we do not expect our existing capital resources  together with the milestone payments and research and development funding we expect to receive  to be sufficient to fund the completion of the development of any of our drug candidates 
as a result  we will need to raise additional funds prior to being able to market any drug candidates  to  among other things  obtain regulatory approvals  fund operating losses  and  if deemed appropriate  establish manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities 
we will seek to raise such additional financing through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  supplemented by  received under a credit facility entered in february with general electric capital corporation and oxford finance corporation  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  our funding resources and requirements may change and will depend upon numerous factors  including but not limited to the progress of our research and development programs  the cost  timing and results of preclinical testing and clinical studies  the receipt and timing of regulatory approvals  if any  determinations as to the commercial potential of our proposed products  the status of competitive products  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others for the purpose of funding certain research and development programs  the acquisition of technologies or drug candidates  and our participation in the manufacture  sale and marketing of any approved drugs
