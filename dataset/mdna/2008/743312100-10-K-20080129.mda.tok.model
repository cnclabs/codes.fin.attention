table of contents in fiscal  we conducted business through three primary operating units 
our principal operating unit conducts business as the openedge division 
the openedge division provides the progress openedge platform  a set of development and deployment technologies  including the openedge rdbms  one of the leading embedded databases  for building business applications 
another operating unit  the enterprise infrastructure division  is focused on enterprise application integration and the market for the enterprise service bus  or esb  and provides distributed infrastructure products that integrate applications and orchestrate business processes across the extended enterprise 
this operating unit also provides event stream processing  data management  data access and synchronization products to enable the real time enterprise 
the third operating unit  datadirect  provides standards based data connectivity software 
the apama operating unit is included as part of our enterprise infrastructure segment  and the easyask operating unit is included as part of our openedge segment 
we did not make any acquisitions in fiscal in fiscal years and  we completed a number of acquisitions  including apama  inc in april  easyask  inc in may  actional corporation actional in january  neon systems  inc neon in january  pantero corporation in june  and openaccess software inc in november these acquisitions were designed to expand the size and breadth of our business and or add complementary products and technologies to existing product sets 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
for further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this form k 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component affecting results of operations 
in determining when to recognize revenue from a customer arrangement  we are often required to exercise judgment regarding the application of our accounting policies to a particular arrangement 
for example  judgment is required in determining whether a customer arrangement has multiple elements 
when such a situation exists  judgment is also involved in determining whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements exists 
while we follow specific and detailed rules and guidelines related to revenue recognition  we make and use significant management judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period  particularly in the areas described above  as well as collectibility 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue could occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we establish this allowance using estimates that we make based on factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  changes to customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different estimates  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we would require additional provisions for doubtful accounts that would increase bad debt expense 
goodwill and intangible assets we had goodwill and net intangible assets of million at november  we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
in fact  during the fourth quarter of  we did identify events that gave rise to a challenge of the carrying amounts of goodwill and resulted in a write down 
we would record an impairment charge if such an assessment were to indicate that the fair value of such assets was less than the carrying value 
judgment is required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 
factors that could indicate that an impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  strategic changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a 
table of contents significant decline in our stock price or in the value of one of our reporting units for a sustained period of time 
we utilize discounted cash flow models or valuation models to assist in determining the fair value of our operating units 
we must make assumptions about future cash flows  future operating plans  discount rates and other factors in those models 
different assumptions and judgment determinations could yield different conclusions that would result in an impairment charge to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
income tax accounting we had a net deferred tax asset of million at november  we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider scheduled reversals of temporary differences  projected future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters in assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance 
if we were to change our assumptions or otherwise determine that we were unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
in fiscal  we will adopt fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
we are currently evaluating the adoption of fin  but it will likely result in a change to the amount of reserves for prior year taxes 
such changes will be recorded directly through equity 
see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this form k 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation expense in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
under sfas r  stock based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock based awards measured at the grant date  is recognized over the relevant service period  and is adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures 
we estimate the fair value of each stock based award on the measurement date using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility  the expected life of options  a risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
many of these assumptions are highly subjective and require the exercise of management judgment 
our management must also apply judgment in developing an estimate of awards that may be forfeited 
if our actual experience differs significantly from our estimates and we choose to employ different assumptions in the future  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ materially from that recorded in the current period 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fin in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the adoption of fin  but it will likely result in a change to the amount of reserves for prior year taxes 
such changes will be recorded directly through equity 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands fair value measurement disclosures 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating whether adoption of sfas will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas provides a fair value option under which a company may irrevocably elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain financial assets and liabilities 
this fair value option will be available on a contract by contract basis with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as those changes occur 
the effective date for sfas for us was december  
table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes a framework to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we will apply sfas r to any acquisition after the date of adoption

liquidity and capital resources our cash and short term investments totaled million and million at november  and  respectively 
the increase of million from the end of fiscal resulted primarily from cash generated from operations 
we held approximately million in tax exempt auction rate securities at november   and none of these investments have been impaired during the recent sub prime mortgage market crisis 
our investments in auction rate securities consist principally of insured governmental debt obligations 
none of the auction rate securities in our portfolio are asset or mortgage backed  and there have been no failed auctions related to those securities 
if an auction were to fail for securities in which we have invested  the investment will not be liquid 
in the event that we need access to these funds  we will not be able to do so until a future auction is successful  the issuer redeems the outstanding securities or the securities mature which in substantially all cases is in excess of one year 
if an issuer of the securities is unable to successfully close future auctions and its credit rating deteriorates or adverse developments occur in the bond insurance market  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of our auction rate securities through a future impairment charge

the increase in fiscal and fiscal as compared to fiscal was also due to costs associated with our ongoing erp implementation 
the remaining amounts in each fiscal year consisted primarily of computer equipment  software and building and leasehold improvements 
we financed these purchases primarily from cash generated from operations 
we purchased and retired  shares of our common stock for million in fiscal year   shares for million in fiscal year  and  shares for million in fiscal year since beginning our stock repurchase program in  we have purchased and retired  shares at a cost of million 
in september  our board of directors authorized  for the period from october  through september   the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock  at such times and at such prices that we deem such purchases to be an effective use of cash 
in fiscal  we purchased certain technology for use in our products for million 
in fiscal years and  we used cash and stock to complete several acquisitions 
each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired companies are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition 
in each case  the cash portion of the purchase price was paid from available funds 
table of contents on november   we acquired the stock of openaccess software inc for an aggregate purchase price of million  net of cash acquired 
on june   we acquired the stock of pantero corporation for an aggregate purchase price of million  net of cash acquired

we include standard intellectual property indemnification provisions in our licensing agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to our product license agreements  we will indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party  generally business partners or customers  in connection with certain patent  copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by third parties with respect to our products 
other agreements with our customers provide indemnification for claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by us or our subcontractors 
historically  our costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been insignificant 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of these indemnification provisions is immaterial 
we believe that existing cash balances together with funds generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements including planned capital expenditures  lease commitments  debt payments and other long term obligations through at least the next twelve months 
revenue backlog our aggregate revenue backlog at november  was approximately million  of which million was included on our balance sheet as deferred revenue  primarily related to unexpired maintenance and support contracts 
at november   the remaining amount of backlog of approximately million was composed of multi year licensing arrangements of approximately million and open software license orders received but not shipped of approximately million 
our backlog of orders not included on the balance sheet is not subject to our normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our basic financial statements 
our aggregate revenue backlog at november  was approximately million  of which million was included on our balance sheet as deferred revenue  primarily related to unexpired maintenance and support contracts 
at november   the remaining amount of backlog of approximately million was composed of multi year licensing arrangements of approximately million and open software license orders received but not shipped of approximately million 
we typically fulfill most of our software license orders within days of acceptance of a purchase order 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize software license revenue upon shipment of the product  or if delivered electronically  when the customer has the right to access the software 
because there are many elements governing when revenue is recognized  including when orders are shipped  credit approval  completion of internal control processes over revenue recognition and other factors  management has some control in determining the period in which certain revenue is recognized 
we frequently have open software license orders at the end of the quarter which have not shipped or have otherwise not met all the required criteria for revenue recognition 
although the amount of open software license orders may vary at any time  we generally do not believe that the amount  if any  of such software license orders at the end of a particular quarter is a reliable indicator of future performance 
in addition  there is no industry standard for the definition of backlog and there may be an element of estimation in determining the amount 
as such  direct comparisons with other companies may be difficult or potentially misleading 

table of contents contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
the following table details our contractual obligations as of november  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt interest payment on long term debt payments for re pricing of stock options operating leases total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and have policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we seek to limit default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
our investments have an average remaining maturity of less than two years and are primarily fixed rate instruments 
in addition  we have classified all of our debt securities as available for sale 
this classification reduces the income statement exposure to interest rate risk if such investments are held until their maturity date because changes in fair value due to market changes in interest rates are recorded on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive instruments and cash flows are immaterial 
we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  which exist as part of our on going business operations 
certain assets and forecasted transactions are exposed to foreign currency risk 
our objective for holding derivatives is to eliminate or reduce the impact of these exposures 
we periodically monitor our foreign currency exposures to enhance the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  british pound  brazilian real  japanese yen and australian dollar 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes  nor do we hold or issue any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
although these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting  we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure  thus managing the associated risk 
the gains or losses from changes in the fair value of such derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in earnings 
we use foreign currency option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas  to hedge a portion of forecasted international intercompany revenue for up to one year in the future 
there were outstanding foreign currency option contracts with a fair value of million and a notional value of million at november  major us multinational banks are counterparties to the option contracts
