item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with our consolidated financial statements  the related notes to these financial statements  and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates  and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures  and markets medical devices and implants for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease 
our principal product offerings are sold throughout the world  primarily in the united states  the european union and  to a lesser extent  japan 
we estimate that the annual worldwide market addressed by our current product lines exceeds billion and that the annual worldwide market for all peripheral vascular devices exceeds billion and is growing at percent per year 
we have used acquisitions as a primary means of further accessing the larger peripheral vascular device market  and we expect to continue to pursue this strategy in the future 
we currently manufacture all of our product lines in our burlington  massachusetts  headquarters with the exception of the leveredge contrast injector  that we acquired in april and the vascular architects products that we acquired in september  for which the manufacturing is currently outsourced 
in addition  our albograft polyester graft product lines  which we acquired in december  are manufactured at our facility in brindisi  italy 
our products are used by vascular surgeons who treat peripheral vascular disease through both open surgical methods and more recently adopted endovascular techniques 
in contrast to interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists  neither of whom are certified to perform open surgical procedures  vascular surgeons can perform both open surgical and minimally invasive endovascular procedures  and are therefore uniquely positioned to provide patients with a wider range of treatment options 
we believe that the purchasing volume of the vascular surgeon will increase and that the changing product needs of the vascular surgeon present us with attractive opportunities to sell new devices 
as a result  we have sought out and acquired new products and businesses that address these needs  such as our acquisition of the contrast injector in april  the remote endarterectomy suite of products in september  our signing of a three year distribution agreement as the exclusive distributor of the endologix powerlink system in european countries  which commenced january   and the acquisition of a line of polyester vascular grafts in december 
table of contents in april we acquired the business  operations  and substantially all of the assets of cardiovascular innovations  llc  which marketed a hand powered contrast injector  called the leveredge contrast injector  for use in a variety of endovascular procedures 
in september  we acquired the business  operations and substantially all the of the assets of vascular architects  which marketed and sold devices for remote endarterectomy  a hybrid open endovascular procedure for the minimally invasive removal of plaque  typically in the superficial femoral artery in the thigh 
in december we acquired biomateriali  srl  a privately held italian company that manufactures polyester prosthetic grafts for vessel replacement in the peripherals  abdomen  and thorax 
including these three acquisitions  we now offer product lines across three product categories 
in october we reached an agreement to launch a direct sales force in italy in january prior to january  we had sold our products in italy through an exclusive distribution agreement with serom medical technologies  srl serom 
we and serom agreed in september to terminate serom s exclusive rights as of january   in exchange for a termination fee of approximately million 
serom had previously held exclusive distribution rights in italy from through the fourth quarter of this agreement is consistent with our strategy of going direct to the hospitals in our major markets 
in addition  effective january   we became the exclusive distributor for the endologix powerlink system  an abdominal stent graft  in european countries  including germany  france and the united kingdom 
we believe that this product complements our endofit thoracic stent graft and unifit abdominal stent graft product lines  allowing our growing european sales force to offer a complete range of stent grafts for the entire aorta 
below is a listing of our product lines and product categories our endovascular dialysis access product category includes our endofit thoracic stent graft  unifit abdominal stent graft  vascutape radiopaque tape  anastoclip vessel closure system  leveredge contrast injector  acquired in april  and aspire covered stent  acquired in september we also report the results of our distribution of the endologix powerlink system within this product category 
our vascular product category includes our expandable lemaitre valvulotome  pruitt inahara and pruitt f carotid shunts  invisigrip vein stripper  lemaitre balloon catheters  and the five remote endarterectomy products acquired in september  which include our martin dissector  periscope  endohelix  mollring cutter  and ring dissector  and the albograft line of polyester prosthetic grafts acquired in december our general surgery product category includes our reddick cholangiogram catheter and optilock implantable port 
we evaluate the sales performance of our various product lines utilizing criteria that varies based upon the position of each product line in its expected life cycle 
for established products  we typically review unit sales and selling prices 
for faster growing products  we typically also focus upon new account generation and customer retention 
our business opportunities include the following the continued expansion of our sales force in north america  europe and japan  the addition of complementary products through further acquisitions  the updating of existing products and introduction of new products through research and development  and the introduction of our products in new markets upon obtainment of regulatory approvals in these markets 
we are currently pursuing each of these opportunities 

table of contents to assist us in evaluating our business strategies  we regularly monitor long term technology trends in the peripheral vascular device market 
additionally  we consider the information obtained from discussions with the medical community in connection with the demand for our products  including potential new product launches 
we also use this information to help determine our competitive position in the peripheral vascular device market and our manufacturing capacity requirements 
we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force 
as of december   our sales force was comprised of sales representatives in north america  the european union and japan  our sales force was comprised of sales representatives as of december  we also sell our products through a network of distributors in various countries outside of the united states and canada 
our worldwide headquarters are located in burlington  massachusetts 
our international operations are headquartered in sulzbach  germany 
we also have sales offices located in tokyo  japan  and rome  italy  and a manufacturing facility in brindisi  italy 
in  approximately of our net sales were generated through markets in which we employ direct sales representatives 
approximately of our net sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  our results of operations are influenced by changes in the currency exchange rates 
increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar  as compared to other currencies in which our net sales are denominated  will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into us dollars for each fiscal period 
further  our strategy for growing our business includes the acquisition of complementary product lines and companies and occasionally the discontinuance of products or activities that are no longer complementary 
these actions may affect the comparability of our financial results from period to period and may cause substantial fluctuations period to period

in january we were notified by one of our biomateriali customers that they would no longer be purchasing a certain product line from us 
this notification resulted in a write down of the related inventory in the fourth quarter of of million 
as a result of this development  we have determined that as of the date of the notification  related intangibles of million have been impaired and will be written off during the first quarter of in march we provided notice of an indemnity claim under the biomateriali purchase agreement to the sellers of biomateriali  contending that the sellers breached certain representations and 
table of contents warranties in the purchase agreement by failing to adequately disclose material information regarding a customer relationship 
we have demanded the payment of damages of approximately million denominated in euros and have ceased making certain post closing payments to the sellers pending resolution of this indemnity claim 
in addition  in january we initiated a plan to reorganize our worldwide operations and  as a result  incurred severance costs of million associated with the reduction of approximately employees or of our worldwide workforce 
sales and expense components the following is a description of the primary components of our net sales and expenses net sales 
we derive our net sales from the sale of our products  less discounts and returns 
most of our sales are generated by our direct sales force and are shipped and billed to hospitals or clinics throughout the world 
in countries where we do not have a direct sales force  sales are primarily generated by shipments to distributors who  in turn  sell to hospitals and clinics 
in those limited cases where our products are held on consignment at a hospital or clinic  we generate sales at the time the product is used in surgery rather than at shipment 
cost of sales 
we manufacture nearly all of the products that we sell 
our cost of sales consists primarily of manufacturing personnel  raw materials and components  depreciation of property and equipment  and other allocated manufacturing overhead  as well as freight expense we pay to ship products to customers 
sales and marketing 
our selling and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries  commissions  travel and entertainment  attendance at medical society meetings  training programs  advertising and product promotions  direct mail  and other marketing costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of executive  finance and human resource expense  legal and accounting fees  information technology expense  and insurance expense 
research and development 
research and development expense includes costs associated with the design  development  testing  enhancement  and regulatory approval of our products and amortization of patents costs 
it also includes costs associated with design and execution of clinical studies and regulatory submissions and costs to register  maintain  and defend our intellectual property 
restructuring 
restructuring expense includes costs directly associated with closing plant facilities to consolidate our manufacturing operations and other moving expenses 
these costs relate to distribution agreement termination expenses  lease termination expenses  severance  and retention costs for terminated employees  and other expenses associated with restructuring our operations 
other income expense 
other income expense primarily includes interest income and expense  foreign currency gains losses  and other miscellaneous gains losses 
income tax expense 
we are subject to federal and state income taxes for earnings generated in the us  which includes operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for certain years depending on tax elections made  and foreign taxes on earnings of our wholly owned german  french  italian  and japanese subsidiaries 
our consolidated tax expense is affected by the mix of our taxable income loss between the united states  germany  france  italy  and japan  permanent items  discrete items  unrecognized tax benefits  and amortization of goodwill for u

net sales increased to million in from million in sales in our endovascular and dialysis access product category increased by  while sales in our vascular and general surgery product categories grew by and  respectively  over the previous year 
increases were driven in part by higher average selling prices  the growth of our direct sales force  direct marketing efforts  the commencement of distribution of the powerlink stent graft in europe  the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations  and the acquisitions of the leveredge contrast injector  aspire stent  and endore product lines 
net sales by geography 
net sales in the united states and canada increased to million in  as compared to million in the increase was driven primarily by increased average selling prices  the growth of our direct sales force  and the acquisitions of the leveredge contrast injector  aspire stent  and endore product lines 
net sales outside of the united states and canada increased to million for 
table of contents compared to million in the increase outside the united states and canada was driven primarily by growth within our endovascular and dialysis access product category  which includes the powerlink stent graft which we began selling in january  and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
direct to hospital net sales represented of the total net sales outside the united states and canada in  as compared to in gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in this gross profit increase was driven primarily by greater net sales  higher average selling prices across several product categories  favorable foreign currency fluctuations  and cost savings resulting from improved operating efficiency in our burlington  massachusetts  facility 
this improvement was partially offset by a million inventory charge in december related to the biomateriali acquisition  as well as our distribution of the powerlink stent graft  which we acquire at a cost that is greater as a percentage of average selling price than nearly all of our other product lines 
gross profit in was negatively impacted by a million inventory write down related to our decision to cease the production and sale of our expedial vascular access graft product line 
the total gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in  compared with in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in  from million in this increase was driven primarily by the addition of sales professionals  their increased compensation  related taxes  benefits  and travel expenses 
at the end of  we employed field sales representatives worldwide  as compared to at the end of general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to costs associated with being a public company including increased finance and legal staff  professional fees  and increased insurance expense 
research and development 
research and development expense increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the hiring of research and development engineers and related product development expenses  focused largely on our endovascular and dialysis access product lines 
we launched four new products in  including the pruitt f carotid shunt january  the flexcel carotid shunt august  the tt tortuous tracker delivery system november  and the redesigned endofit thoracic stent graft december 
restructuring 
restructuring expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in expenses for include payments resulting from the termination of two former european distributors due to our decision to go direct in those countries 
in addition  in february our former italian distributor began providing us with market transition services  and we estimate that we will incur approximately million of related expense between february and july expenses for include exit costs of million for our phoenix  arizona  facility  which closed in july  and exit costs of  for our brymbo  wales  facility  which closed in december purchased research and development 
in conjunction with a technology acquisition in december  we acquired in process research and development with a fair value of million that was expensed on the date of acquisition  as the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use to us at the date of acquisition 
this treatment is consistent with the aicpa practice guide  assets acquired in a business combination to be used in r d activities 
impairment charge 
the impairment charge of million for resulted from the write down of certain patents and production equipment in connection with our decision to cease production and sales of our expedial vascular access graft product line  net of the proceeds from the subsequent sale of those assets of million 
we also wrote down million of related expedial inventory  which has been included in cost of sales 

table of contents other income expense 
in interest income was million compared to million in the increase was due to a significant increase in cash on hand resulting from the proceeds of our initial public offering in october in interest expense decreased by million  as we used a portion of the proceeds from the initial public offered to pay down all outstanding indebtedness 
gain on foreign currency was due to a relative increase in the strength of the euro as compared to the us dollar 
other income expense for was primarily due to losses on the disposal of equipment in income tax expense we recorded a provision for taxes in of million  despite losses before income taxes of million 
this was the result of a number of factors  including taxes on profits of foreign subsidiaries  recovery of taxes paid by means of carry back claims in excess of amounts previously recognized  deferred tax liabilities related to the amortization of goodwill for us tax purposes  which cannot be used to reduce existing deferred tax assets  the tax effect of elimination of intercompany profit in inventory  and effects of changes in uncertain tax positions 
we monitor the mix of profitability by tax jurisdiction and adjust our annual expected rate on a quarterly basis 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that the tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies 
tax reserves established include transfer pricing  withholding taxes  and various state and foreign audit matters  some of which may be resolved in the near future resulting in an adjustment to the reserve  which includes the results of our foreign subsidiaries 
we provide a full valuation for net deferred tax assets  as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized 
however  it is possible that the more likely than not criterion could be met at some time in the future  which could result in the reversal of a significant portion or all of the valuation allowance  which  at that time  would be recorded as a tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin on january  this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation  and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized no adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits

net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in sales in our endovascular and dialysis access product category increased by  while sales in our vascular and general surgery product categories grew by and  respectively  over the same period in the previous year 
increases were driven by increased unit sales in the endovascular and dialysis access product category  the growth of our direct sales force  higher average selling prices across most product lines and an increase in direct marketing efforts 
sales in were reduced by the discontinuation of private label manufacturing activities and the expedial vascular access graft product line

gross profit increased to million in from million in this gross profit increase was driven primarily by higher average selling prices across most product categories as well as cost savings resulting from the consolidation of manufacturing operations to our burlington  massachusetts  facility in and this gross profit increase was offset partially by a million inventory write down related to our decision to cease the production and sale of our expedial vascular access graft product line in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in  from million in this increase was driven primarily by the addition of sales professionals in  as well as an increase in marketing and advertising of our product lines primarily through direct mail  journal ads and trade shows 
at the end of  we employed field sales representatives worldwide  as compared to at the end of general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in the increase was driven primarily by the higher costs associated with being a public company  including increased finance and legal staff  professional fees and increased insurance expense

table of contents income tax expense 
we are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
the tax provision was significantly different than that based on the federal statutory rate of as a result of several factors  including taxes on profits of foreign subsidiaries  recovery of taxes paid by means of carry back claims in excess of amounts previously recognized  deferred tax liabilities related to the amortization of goodwill for us tax purposes  which cannot be used to reduce existing deferred tax assets  the tax effect of elimination of intercompany profit in inventory  and the effects of changes in uncertain tax positions 
we monitor the mix of profitability by tax jurisdiction and adjust our annual expected rate on a quarterly basis 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that the tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies 
tax reserves established include transfer pricing  withholding taxes  and various state and foreign audit matters  some of which may be resolved in the near future resulting in an adjustment to the reserve  which includes the results of our foreign subsidiaries 
our provision for income taxes in was million compared to million in liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were million as compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with maturities of days or less at the date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions and us government obligations and are stated at cost  which approximates fair value 
our marketable securities are primarily marketable debt securities  commercial paper  corporate bonds  and us government securities that we classify as available for sale and are carried at fair market value 
we did not hold any auction rated securities in our investment portfolio as of december  the majority of our marketable securities have remaining maturities of two years or less 
our investment portfolio includes million of asset backed securities collateralized by first lien mortgages  credit card debt  and auto loans 
in the event of a temporary decline in market value  we have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested 
we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and attempt to mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures 
we intend to continue to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as necessary 
based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio  we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of the current credit environment 
we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures  and pay our long term liabilities 
since our inception  we have funded our operations through private placements of equity securities  short term borrowings  and funds generated from our operations 
in october we completed our initial public offering of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we sold  shares and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commission of approximately million 
we also incurred approximately million of additional expenses associated with our initial public offering of which we had paid approximately million prior to completing our initial public offering 
of the million of net proceeds we received in our initial public offering  we have spent million  including million to pay down all outstanding indebtedness under two term loans and a revolving line of credit  million for payment of expenses related to our initial public offering  million for acquisitions  million for the early termination of our italian distributor  and million for the acquisition and licensing of technology of which million was expensed on the date of acquisition as in process research and development 
we expect our cash balances to decrease as we continue to use cash to fund our operations  make acquisitions  and make deferred payments related to prior acquisitions 
in august we amended our revolving line of credit with our bank 
as a result of this amendment  our borrowing capacity increased to million and the maximum principal amount of any letters of credit issued as 
table of contents part of this facility increased to million 
the maturity date for amounts borrowed was extended to august loans made under this revolving line of credit bear interest rates at libor plus basis points or the bank s base rate  at our discretion 
borrowings under this line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
as of december   we had no borrowing outstanding under this line of credit 
the loan agreement requires that we meet certain financial and operating covenants 
as of december  we were in compliance with these covenants 
net cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million in and consisted of the million net loss adjusted for non cash related items of million  including depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation of million  deferred income taxes of million  provision for losses in accounts receivable of million  and inventory write offs of million partially offset by accretion of discount on marketable securities of million  and net cash used from changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the net cash used from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily a result of higher levels in inventory  accounts receivable  and prepaid expenses and other assets  partially offset by higher levels of accounts payable and other liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in this was primarily due to the payment of million for the acquisitions that were completed in biomateriali srl  substantially all of the assets of the wallace enterprises  inc  d b a vascular architects  and cardiovascular innovations  llc  as well as million for the acquisition of technology from arizona heart innovative technologies  llc  of which million was in process research and development that was expensed on the date of acquisition 
these acquisitions entail remaining non contingent deferred purchase price obligations of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in this was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of common stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by expenses that we paid in associated with our initial public offering and the repurchase of our common stock 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase in absolute dollars in connection with the growth of our business and our operations as a public company  including consulting expenses associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of we expect to fund these increased costs and expenditures from our cash flows from operations and our existing cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
however  our future capital requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the revenues generated by sales of our products  the costs associated with expanding our manufacturing  marketing  sales and distribution efforts  the rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities  patent litigation  the costs of obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances of our products and products in development  the effects of competing technological and market developments  the costs associated with being a public company  including consulting expenses associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the number and timing of future acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  the cash we expect to generate from operations as well as the available million line of credit with our bank  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may require additional funds in order to make acquisitions 
we may seek financing of future cash needs through the sale of equity securities and debt 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  such financing will be at terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our business operations or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if additional funds are obtained by issuing equity or debt securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
contractual obligations 
our principal contractual obligations consist of operating leases  termination costs to our former distributors  acquisition related obligations  inventory purchase commitments  and income tax 
table of contents obligations under fin for unrecognized tax benefits 
the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations total less than year years years in thousands operating leases fees for termination of distributors purchase commitments for inventory acquisition related obligations fin unrecognized tax benefits total contractual obligations the commitments under our operating leases shown above consist primarily of lease payments for our burlington  massachusetts  corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility and a separate manufacturing and storage facility in burlington  massachusetts  each expiring in  our sulzbach  germany office  expiring in  and our tokyo  japan office  expiring in in addition  there are potential contingent payments associated with the biomateriali stock purchase agreement and product distribution agreement that could not be resolved beyond reasonable doubt as of december  these contingent payments could total up to million based upon the exchange rates in effect on december  
due to the uncertainly of the future payouts  they have not been recorded as part of the purchase price for biomateriali 
when the contingencies are resolved  they may result in recognition of an additional cost and the purchase price will be adjusted at that time 
the initial purchase price before including any contingent consideration is less than the sum of the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed the excess 
therefore  in accordance with the guidance with sfas no 
 we have established a liability for the difference between the consideration recognized as of december   and the fair value of the net assets acquired 
when the contingencies amounting to approximately million are resolved  any excess of the fair value of the contingent payments over the amount million that was recognized as if it were a liability will be recognized as an additional cost of the biomateriali acquisition 
if the amount initially recognized as if it were a liability exceeds the fair value of the contingent payments made  the excess will be allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts initially assigned to the identifiable intangible assets acquired in accordance with the guidance in sfas no 
subsequent events in january we were notified by one of our biomateriali customers that they would no longer be purchasing a certain product line from us 
this notification resulted in a write down of the related inventory in december of million 
as a result of this development  we have determined that as of the date of the notification  related intangibles of million have been impaired and will be written off during the first quarter of in march we provided notice of an indemnity claim under the biomateriali purchase agreement to the sellers of biomateriali  contending that the sellers breached certain representations and warranties in the purchase agreement by failing to adequately disclose material information regarding a customer relationship 
we have demanded the payment of damages of approximately million denominated in euros and have ceased making certain post closing payments to the sellers pending resolution of this indemnity claim 
in january we initiated a plan to reorganize our worldwide operations and  as a result  incurred severance costs of million associated with the reduction of approximately employees or of our worldwide workforce 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are 
table of contents described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  sales returns and discounts  and income taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis and updated as appropriate 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry  and information provided by physicians who use our products and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates and related accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements 
those financial estimates and related policies include revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally use customer purchase orders or contracts to determine the existence of an arrangement 
substantially all sales transactions are based on prices that are determinable at the time that the customer s purchase order is accepted by us 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we would defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we provide for product returns at the time revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  based on our historical return product history 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable are with customers based in the us and internationally 
accounts receivable generally are due within to days of invoice and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the current creditworthiness of the customers  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor aging reports  collections  and payments from customers  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues we identify 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and allowances  we cannot guarantee the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in 
table of contents our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectibility 
the provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in general and administrative expenses 
inventory inventory consists of finished products  work in process  and raw materials 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
cost includes materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead and is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast  which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate  and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
stock based compensation through december   we measured employee stock based compensation expense using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no  or fin   accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  and related interpretations 
for stock options granted to employees  no compensation expense was recognized unless the exercise price was less than the estimated fair value  for financial reporting purposes 
until january   we complied with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which required that we disclose our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per common share as if we had expensed the fair value of employee stock options 
for purposes of this pro forma disclosure  we estimated the fair value of stock options issued to employees using the minimum value valuation option pricing model 
our minimum value valuation option pricing model required the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of these options and our expected stock price volatility 
therefore  the estimated fair value of our employee stock options could vary significantly as a result of changes in the assumptions used 
our use of the minimum value model was primarily due to our determination as to its appropriateness as well as its general acceptance as an option valuation technique for private companies 
as described below  we no longer utilize the minimum value method subsequent to january   and the fair value of our options will be higher as a result 
through december   we accounted for stock based compensation expense for non employees using the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
 as continued by sfas r and the black scholes option pricing model  and record the fair value  for financial reporting purposes  of non employee stock options as an expense over either the vesting term of the option or the service period 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of share based compensation 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires nonpublic companies that used the minimum value method in sfas no 
for either recognition or pro forma disclosures to apply sfas no 
r using the prospective transition method 
as such  we will continue to apply apb in future periods to equity awards outstanding at the date of sfas no 
r s adoption that were measured using the minimum value method 
in accordance with this standard  the prior period pro forma stock information has not been restated 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we recognize the compensation cost of share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
for the year ended december   we recorded expense of approximately million in connection with share based payment awards 
the future expense of non vested options of approximately million is to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents in  we issued stock options to two of our executive officers for the purchase of an aggregate of  shares and to one of these executive officers an award of an additional  shares of our common stock 
the options and award were subject to restricted stock agreements that provided us the right to purchase  and the executive officers with the right to cause us to purchase  these shares 
the purchase right features of these agreements terminated upon the completion of our initial public offering in october we accounted for these options and award until using variable plan accounting since the exercise of the employee repurchase price was considered likely based on the lack of marketability of our common stock 
after reviewing a variety of factors  we subsequently determined that the likelihood of either us or these executive officers exercising these purchase options was remote 
consequently  subsequent to we have accounted for these options and award using fixed plan accounting 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  based on the use of the prospective method of adoption  these options and this award will continue to be accounted for under apb no 
as fixed plan arrangements 
concurrently with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we applied the guidance included in accounting series release no 
and emerging issues task force no 
d with respect to the redemption feature related to these options and award 
the effect of the adoption resulted in the classification of the intrinsic value of the redemption feature of million at january   from retained earnings to other than permanent equity 
during  the value of the redemption feature increased by million to million  which was charged against retained earnings 
the repurchase and call right features terminated upon the completion of our public offering of our common stock resulting in a million credit to additional paid in capital 
prior to our initial public offering there was no public market for our common stock  and in connection with our issuance of stock options the fair value for our common stock was estimated by our board of directors  with input from management 
our board of directors exercised judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on several factors  including transactions in our common stock  key milestones achieved in our business  and both historical and forecasted net sales 
in the absence of a contemporaneous arms length transaction  our board typically estimated the fair value of our common stock based upon an enterprise valuation determined by multiplying our trailing six months of net sales by two  and then multiplying that amount by four 
we believed this to be a reasonable methodology based upon our internal peer company analyses and based on several arms length transactions involving our common stock supportive of the results produced by this valuation methodology 
we have not historically obtained contemporaneous valuations by an unrelated valuation specialist because  at the time of the issuances of stock options  we believed our estimates of the fair value of our common stock to be reasonable and consistent with our understanding of how similarly situated companies in our industry are valued 
as disclosed more fully in the notes of our financial statements  during we granted stock options at an exercise price of and restricted stock units with fair value prices ranging from to in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december   and in preparing for the initial public offering of our common stock  we reassessed the valuations of our common stock during the month period ended march   in light of the aicpa s practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  which we refer to as the practice aid 
in conducting this assessment we took into consideration the market and income approaches to valuation as set forth in the practice aid 
we believe that the valuation methodologies that we used prior to this public offering are consistent with the practice aid 
based on the foregoing analysis  we concluded that for all options granted during the month period ended march   in no case did the fair value of our common stock  for financial reporting purposes  exceed the exercise price for these options at the time of grant 
valuation of goodwill  other intangibles when we acquire another company  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  among acquired tangible net assets  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill as required by us gaap 
goodwill represents the excess 
table of contents of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of the acquired businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists 
we evaluate the december balance of the carrying value of goodwill based on a single reporting unit annually and more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
the first step of our goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and thus the second step of the impairment test  used to measure the amount of the impairment loss  is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill as of the date of the impairment review with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of our goodwill is determined on the same basis as the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with a business combination 
specifically  we allocate the fair value of our reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination as of the date of the impairment review and as if the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we have determined that no impairment charges were required during the year ended december  the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  principally related to the determination that we operate as a single unit and therefore that fair value is based on the our market capitalization 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our combined consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts 
goodwill was million as of december   and million as of december  other intangible assets consist primarily of purchased developed technology  patents  customer relationships  and trademarks and are amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from five to years 
we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value may not be recoverable 
other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million as of december   and million as of december  the evaluation of asset impairments related to other intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
contingencies in the normal course of business  we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  and other claims and assessments for matters related to  among other things  patent infringement  business acquisitions  employment  and product recalls 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
we record charges for the costs we anticipate incurring in connection with litigation and claims against us when we can reasonably estimate these costs 
during the years ended december    and  we were not subject to any material litigation  claims or assessments 
restructuring we record restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation or relocation of operations  exited business lines  or shutdowns of specific sites 
these restructuring charges  which reflect our commitment 
table of contents to a termination or exit plan that will begin within twelve months  are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with site closure  legal matters  contract terminations  or other costs directly related to the restructuring 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a credit to earnings will be recognized 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from taxable income during the carryback period or in the future  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we do not provide for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  as our current intention is to permanently reinvest these earnings 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin on january  fin clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation  and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized no adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within the united states and outside of the united states and may be subject to audits from various tax authorities regarding transfer pricing  the deductibility of certain expenses  intercompany transactions  and other matters 
within specific countries  we may be subject to audit by various tax authorities operating within the country and may be subject to different statutes of limitation expiration dates 
management s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  liabilities for uncertain tax positions  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of million in and million in marketable securities we account for our investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
our investments  primarily marketable debt securities  commercial paper  and us government securities  are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair market value at december  the unrealized gains losses on available for sale securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents  and investments with original maturities of greater than days to be short term investments 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

 fair value measurement 
sfas no 
provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applied whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated results and financial position 
in february the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas no 
a company may elect to use fair value to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
if the use of fair value is elected  any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred  such as debt issuance costs 
the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 changes in fair value are recognized in earnings

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign exchange fluctuations and interest rates  which could impact our results of operations and financial position 
we do not currently engage in any hedging or other market risk management tools  and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro  could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  for the year ended december   approximately of our sales were denominated in foreign currencies 
certain payments related to recent acquisitions are denominated in foreign currencies and certain of our products  namely the endore devices  aspire covered stent  and the albograft vascular graft  are manufactured outside of the united states 
we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our sales in the future 
selling  marketing  and administrative costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  thereby mitigating our transaction risk exposure 
therefore  we believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not substantial 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases and if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
the majority of sales recorded in foreign currencies are denominated in the euro 
our principal exchange rate risk therefore exists between the us dollar and the euro 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the re measurement of our foreign currency denominated receivables and payables  generating currency transaction gains or losses that impact our non operating income expense levels in the respective period and are reported in other income expense  net in our consolidated financial statements 
we recorded a million foreign currency gain in and million foreign currency loss in related mainly to the re measurement of our foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we may  however  hedge such exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk at december   is related primarily to our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio includes fixed rate debt instruments of us government and corporate issuers and is primarily short term investments 
the primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields 
a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of our investments to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing rate rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  investments are generally held to maturity 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
credit risk 
in addition  to a decline in interest rates  other economic variables  such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk  could result in a higher decline in our investment portfolio 
the majority of our marketable securities have remaining maturities of two years or less 
our investment portfolio includes million of asset back securities collateralized by first lien mortgages  credit card debt  and auto loans 
we did not hold any auction rated securities in our investment portfolio as of december  in the event of a temporary decline in market value  we have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested 
we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures in accordance with our policies 
we intend to continue to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary 
based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of the current credit environment
