item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company  incorporated in delaware in  focused on developing small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and cancer 
our current development activities are primarily directed to advancing multiple drug candidates through clinical trials with the objective of determining the intended pharmacodynamic effect or effects in two principal diseases heart failure and cancer 
our drug development pipeline consists of a drug candidate  ck  being developed in both an intravenous and oral formulation for the potential treatment of heart failure  and three drug candidates  ispinesib  sb and gsk  each being developed in an intravenous formulation for the potential treatment of cancer 
our drug candidates are all novel small molecules that arose from our research activities and are directed toward the biology of the cytoskeleton 
we believe our understanding of the cytoskeleton enables us to discover novel and potentially safer and more effective therapeutics 
cardiovascular program our drug candidate  ck  a novel cardiac myosin activator for the potential treatment of heart failure  is currently being developed as part of a clinical trials program  comprised of phase i and phase iia 
table of contents trials  designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic profile of this drug candidate in both an intravenous and oral formulation 
in april  we initiated a phase iia  multi center  double blind  randomized  placebo controlled  dose escalation clinical trial of ck in patients with stable heart failure 
the primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ck administered as an intravenous infusion to stable heart failure patients 
the secondary objectives of this trial are to establish a relationship between plasma concentration and pharmacodynamic effects of ck and to determine the pharmacokinetics of ck in stable heart failure patients 
in april  we initiated a single center  open label  sequential  parallel group  phase i clinical trial designed to evaluate potential drug drug interactions with ck the trial is designed to evaluate the effects of oral ketoconazole  a strong metabolic inhibitor of p cyp a  and diltiazem  a moderate cypa inhibitor  on the pharmacokinetics of ck given in an intravenous formulation to healthy volunteers 
in july  we initiated a single center  two part  open label  phase i clinical trial of ck designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of three different oral modified release prototypes 
oncology program ispinesib  our most advanced drug candidate  has been the subject of a broad phase ii clinical trials program under the sponsorship of glaxosmithkline  or gsk  and the national cancer institute  or nci  designed to evaluate its efficacy against multiple tumor types 
we have reported phase ii clinical trials data from this program in metastatic breast  non small cell lung  ovarian  colorectal  head and neck  hepatocellular  renal and prostate cancers and in melanoma 
to date  we believe clinical activity for ispinesib has been observed in non small cell lung cancer  ovarian and breast cancers  with the most robust clinical activity observed in a phase ii clinical trial evaluating ispinesib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that had failed treatment with taxanes and anthracyclines 
we are conducting  at our expense  a focused development program for ispinesib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
this program is intended to build upon the previous data from the clinical trials conducted by gsk and the nci  and is designed to further define the clinical activity profile of ispinesib in advanced breast cancer patients in preparation for potentially initiating a phase iii clinical trial of ispinesib for the second line treatment of advanced breast cancer 
in december  we initiated a phase i ii monotherapy clinical trial designed to evaluate ispinesib in the first line treatment of chemotherapy na ve patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer on a more dose dense schedule than was previously studied 
we continue to enroll and dose escalate patients in an open label  non randomized phase i ii clinical trial of sb  our second drug candidate for the treatment of cancer  in order to evaluate the safety  tolerability  pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic profile in patients with hodgkin or non hodgkin lymphoma 
in december  interim data from this ongoing trial was presented at the annual meeting of the american society of hematology 
in august  we announced that gsk had initiated a first time in humans phase i clinical trial of gsk this clinical trial is an open label  non randomized  dose finding trial designed to investigate the safety  tolerability  pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic profile of gsk in patients with advanced solid tumors 
the initiation of this clinical trial triggered a milestone payment of million from gsk to cytokinetics under our collaboration and license agreement with gsk  or gsk agreement 
ispinesib  sb and gsk are being developed in connection with our strategic alliance with gsk  established in  which is focused on novel small molecule therapeutics targeting human mitotic kinesins for applications in the treatment of cancer and other diseases 
pursuant to our november amendment to the gsk agreement  we have assumed responsibility for the continued development of ispinesib and sb  at our expense  and subject to gsk s option to resume responsibility for some or all development and commercialization activities associated with either or both of these novel drug candidate  exercisable during a defined period 
if gsk does not exercise its option for either ispinesib or sb  we will be obligated to pay royalties to gsk on the sales of any resulting products 
the november amendment supersedes a previous amendment to the 
table of contents collaboration agreement dated september  which specifically related to sb cytokinetics and gsk continue to conduct collaborative research activities directed to inhibitors of centromere associated protein e  or cenp e  including gsk  pursuant to a june amendment to the strategic alliance 
we are also pursuing other early research programs addressing a number of therapeutic areas  including the potential treatment of hypertension  asthma and neuromuscular diseases 
since our inception in august  we have incurred significant net losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years if and to the extent we advance ck through clinical development for the treatment of heart failure and amgen does not exercise its option to participate in later stage development and commercialization  we conduct continued phase i  phase ii and later stage development and commercialization of ispinesib  sb or gsk under our collaboration and license agreement with gsk  as amended  we exercise our option to co fund the development of gsk or of any other drug candidate being developed by gsk under our strategic alliance  we exercise our option to co promote any of the products for which we have elected co fund development under our strategic alliance with gsk  we advance other potential drug candidates into clinical trials  we expand our research programs and further develop our proprietary drug discovery technologies  or we elect to fund development or commercialization of any drug candidate 
we intend to pursue selective strategic alliances to enable us to maintain financial and operational flexibility 
cardiovascular we have focused our cardiovascular research and development activities on heart failure  a disease most often characterized by compromised contractile function of the heart that impacts its ability to effectively pump blood throughout the body 
we have discovered and optimized small molecules that have the potential to improve cardiac contractility by specifically binding to and activating cardiac myosin  a cytoskeletal protein essential for cardiac muscle contraction 
this work gave rise to our drug candidate ck  a novel small molecule cardiac myosin activator 
ck entered clinical trials in based on data from our first time in humans phase i clinical trial with this drug candidate  in april  we initiated a clinical trials program for ck  comprised of phase i and phase iia designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic profile of both intravenous and oral formulations of this drug candidate in a diversity of patients  including patients with stable heart failure and patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy 
our goal is to develop ck as a potential treatment across the continuum of care in heart failure  both in the hospital setting as an intravenous formulation for the treatment of acutely decompensated heart failure and in the outpatient setting as an oral formulation for the treatment of chronic heart failure 
in december  we entered into a collaboration and option agreement with amgen to discover  develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics that activate cardiac muscle contractility for potential applications in the treatment of heart failure  including ck the agreement provides amgen with a non exclusive license and access to certain technology  as well as an exclusive option to participate in future development and commercialization of ck world wide  excluding japan 
amgen s option is exercisable during a defined period  the ending of which is dependent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  primarily the delivery of phase i and phase iia clinical trials data for ck in accordance with an agreed development plan  the results of which may be sufficient to support its progression into phase iib clinical development 
ck intravenous phase i first time in humans in  we initiated a first time in humans phase i clinical trial with ck this clinical trial was designed as a double blind  randomized  placebo controlled  dose escalation trial to investigate the safety  tolerability  pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic profile of a six hour infusion of ck in healthy volunteers 
clinical data from this trial were presented at the heart failure society of america  or hfsa  meeting in september the maximum tolerated dose  or mtd  was mg kg hr for this 
table of contents regimen 
at this dose  the six hour infusion of ck produced statistically significant mean increases in left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening of and absolute percentage points  respectively  as compared to placebo 
these increases in indices of left ventricular function were associated with a mean prolongation of systolic ejection time of milliseconds  which was also statistically significant 
these mean changes in ejection fraction  fractional shortening and ejection time were concentration dependent and ck exhibited generally linear  dose proportional pharmacokinetics across the range of doses studied 
at the mtd  ck was well tolerated when compared to placebo 
the adverse effects at the dose levels exceeding the mtd in humans appeared similar to the adverse findings observed in the preclinical safety studies  and occurred at similar plasma concentrations 
these effects are believed to be related to an excess of the intended pharmacologic effect  resulting in excessive prolongation of the systolic ejection time  and resolved promptly with discontinuation of the infusions of ck the phase i clinical trial activity of ck is consistent with results from preclinical models that evaluated ck in normal dogs  however  further clinical trials are necessary to determine whether similar results will also be seen in patients with heart failure 
a poster presented at the september hfsa meeting provided additional data and analysis regarding this trial 
the objective of this analysis was to evaluate the concentration response relationship of ck on left ventricular function in healthy volunteers 
the authors concluded that ck increased left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular fractional shortening over a range of well tolerated plasma concentrations 
in addition  it was determined that systolic ejection time was the most sensitive marker of drug effect and that increases in left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular fractional shortening were well correlated with increases in systolic ejection time 
systolic ejection time is easily measured and we believe may serve as a useful indicator of this drug candidate s effect in patients with heart failure 
phase iia stable heart failure in april  we initiated a phase iia  multiple center  double blind  randomized  placebo controlled  dose escalation clinical trial of ck in patients with stable heart failure 
in addition to the trial s primary objective of evaluating the safety and tolerability of ck  its secondary objectives are to establish a relationship between the plasma concentration and the pharmacodynamic effects of ck and to determine its pharmacokinetics in stable heart failure patients 
in addition to routine assessments of vital signs  blood samples and electrocardiographic monitoring  echocardiograms will be performed to evaluate cardiac function at various pre defined time points 
the clinical trial will consist of up to five cohorts of eight patients with stable heart failure 
the first three of these cohorts will each undergo four treatment periods  patients will receive three escalating active doses of ck administered intravenously and one placebo treatment which will be randomized into the dose escalation sequence 
patients in the fourth and fifth cohorts may receive only a single dose level of ck in each cohort  patients will receive a one hour loading infusion to rapidly achieve a target plasma concentration of ck  followed by a slower infusion intended to maintain that plasma concentration 
these maintenance infusions are planned to be one hour in duration in the first two cohorts  and hours in duration in the third cohorts 
we have completed the treatment phase for the second cohort of patients in this clinical trial 
we anticipate interim data to be available from this trial in the first half of we anticipate final data to be available from this trial during the second half of ck oral phase i oral bioavailability in december  we announced results from a phase i oral bioavailability study of ck in healthy volunteers 
we believe that these data support our current activities to develop a modified release oral formulation of ck to enable late stage clinical development of a dosing schedule that may be suitable for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure 
this study was designed as an open label  four way crossover study in ten healthy volunteers designed to investigate the absolute bioavailability of two oral formulations liquid and immediate release solid formulations of ck versus an intravenous dose 
in addition  the effect of taking the immediate release solid formulation in a fed versus fasted state on the relative bioavailability of ck was also assessed 
volunteers were administered  in random order  ck at mg kg as a liquid solution taken orally in a fasted state  an immediate release solid formulation taken in fed and fasted states and a reference intravenous infusion at a constant rate over one hour 
pharmacokinetic data from this study demonstrated oral bioavailability of approximately for each of the three conditions of oral administration 
the median time to maximum plasma concentrations after dosing was hours for the liquid solution taken orally  one hour for the immediate release solid formulation taken in a fasted state  and hours for the immediate release solid formulation taken after eating 
this rapid and essentially complete oral absorption suggests 
table of contents that predictable plasma levels can be achieved with chronic oral dosing in patients with heart failure 
a poster summarizing the results of this study was presented at the september hfsa meeting 
the authors concluded that the near complete absolute bioavailability of ck suggested that there is little or no first pass metabolism of this drug candidate 
in addition  food did not have a substantial effect on bioavailability but appeared to delay drug absorption in some subjects 
ck  in both the oral and intravenous formulations  was well tolerated with no significant safety issues observed 
the near complete absolute bioavailability suggested that there is little or no first pass metabolism of this drug candidate 
we believe that these data support our current activities to develop a modified release oral formulation of ck to enable late stage clinical development of a dosing schedule that may be suitable for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure 
phase i drug drug interaction in april  we announced the initiation of a single center  open label  sequential  parallel group  phase i clinical trial of ck designed to evaluate the effects of oral ketoconazole  a strong inhibitor of the metabolic enzyme cytochrome p cyp a  on the pharmacokinetics of ck given orally to up to healthy male volunteers  of whom have a normal genotype for cypd  and up to eight of whom have reduced cypd activity 
in addition  the effects of diltiazem  a moderate cypa inhibitor  on the pharmacokinetics of ck will be assessed in eight additional volunteers who are normal metabolizers by way of cypd we continue to enroll subjects with reduced cypd activity into this trial 
we anticipate data from this trial to be available in phase i multi dose in july  we announced the initiation of a single center  phase i clinical trial designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of an oral formulation of ck in healthy volunteers 
the trial progressed from a single blind  single dose phase to a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  multi dose phase 
we completed treatment in this trial in december we anticipate data from this trial to be available in phase i modified release in december  we initiated a single center  two part  open label  phase i clinical trial of up to twelve healthy male volunteers 
the primary objective of this trial is to assess the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of three different oral modified release prototypes of ck the secondary objective of the trial is to determine whether there is an effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of one of these oral modified release prototypes of ck we anticipate data from this trial to be available in planned clinical trials 
in the first half of  we anticipate initiating two additional phase iia clinical trials of ck the first of these clinical trials is intended to evaluate an intravenous form of ck in stable heart failure patients undergoing cardiac catheterization 
the second is intended to evaluate an intravenous form together with an oral formulation of ck in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy 
ck is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when we will be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from its commercialization 
we currently fund all research and development costs associated with this program 
we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our cardiovascular program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our cardiovascular program will increase significantly as we advance ck through clinical development 
our expenditures will also increase if amgen does not exercise its option and we elect to develop ck or related compounds independently  or if we elect to co fund later stage development of ck or other compounds in our cardiovascular program under our collaboration and option agreement with amgen following amgen s exercise of its option 
if amgen elects to exercise its option  they would be responsible for development and commercialization of ck and related compounds  subject to our development and commercial participation rights 
in addition  we may be eligible to receive pre commercialization and commercialization milestone payments of up to million on ck and other products arising from the research under the collaboration as well as escalating royalties based on increasing levels of annual net sales of products commercialized under the agreement 
the agreement also provides for us to receive increased royalties by co funding phase iii development costs of drug candidates under the collaboration 
if we elect to co fund such costs  we would be entitled to co promote products in north america and participate in agreed commercial activities in institutional care settings  at amgen s expense 
if amgen elects not to exercise its option on 
table of contents ck  we may then independently proceed to develop ck and the research collaboration would terminate 
oncology in  we continued to advance our oncology development programs for ispinesib and sb as they progressed in phase i of their respective phase i ii clinical trials 
in  we entered into two amendments to our collaboration and license agreement with gsk  or the gsk agreement  regarding the future research  development and commercialization of ispinesib  sb and cenp e 
in june  we amended the agreement to extend the initial five year research term of this strategic alliance for an additional year to continue activities focused towards translational research directed to cenp e 
in november  we further amended the agreement and assumed  at our expense  responsibility for the continued research  development and commercialization of inhibitors of kinesin spindle protein  or ksp  including ispinesib and sb  and other mitotic kinesins  other than cenp e 
in june  the agreement was further amended to extend the research term for an additional year  through june   to facilitate continued research activities under the updated research plan focused towards cenp e 
we are also researching other compounds for the potential treatment of cancer 
ispinesib the clinical trials program for ispinesib has consisted to date of nine phase ii clinical trials and eight phase i or ib clinical trials evaluating the use of this drug candidate in a variety of both solid and hematologic cancers 
we believe that the breadth of this clinical trials program has taken into consideration the potential and the complexity of developing a drug candidate such as ispinesib  and should help us to identify those tumor types and dosing regimens that are the most promising for the continued development of ispinesib 
we have reported phase ii clinical trial data for ispinesib in metastatic breast  non small cell lung  ovarian  colorectal  head and neck  hepatocellular  renal and prostate cancers and in melanoma 
to date  we believe clinical activity for ispinesib has been observed in non small cell lung cancer  ovarian and breast cancer  with the most robust clinical activity observed in a phase ii clinical trial evaluating ispinesib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that had failed treatment with taxanes and anthracyclines 
under our strategic alliance with gsk  we have initiated a focused development program for ispinesib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
this program is intended to build upon the previous data from the clinical trials conducted by gsk and the nci  and is designed to further define the clinical activity profile of ispinesib in chemotherapy na ve locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients in preparation for potentially initiating a later stage clinical trials program of ispinesib for the second line treatment of advanced breast cancer 
currently ongoing and recently completed clinical trials of ispinesib are as follows breast cancer in june  we announced the final results from a multicenter phase ii clinical trial sponsored by gsk  which evaluated the safety and efficacy of ispinesib in the second or third line treatment of patients with locally advanced stage iiib or metastatic stage iv breast cancer whose disease had recurred or progressed despite treatment with anthracyclines and taxanes 
in this trial  patients received ispinesib as monotherapy at mg m as a hour intravenous infusion every days 
the primary endpoint of the clinical trial was objective response as determined using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors  or recist 
the best overall responses observed with ispinesib were partial responses in of evaluable patients as measured by recist and the duration of response ranged from weeks to weeks 
the most common adverse event was grade neutropenia 
based on these data  and consistent with our focused approach to the further development of ispinesib  in december  we initiated an open label  non randomized phase i ii clinical trial designed to evaluate ispinesib as monotherapy as a first line treatment in chemotherapy na ve patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
this trial is designed to be a proof of concept study to potentially amplify the signals of clinical activity seen in gsk s phase ii monotherapy trial of ispinesib in breast cancer  and is intended to provide the data necessary to inform ispinesib s further development  as well as to inform gsk s potential exercise of its option to develop and commercialize ispinesib 
the phase i portion of the phase i ii trial is designed to determine the dose limiting toxicity and mtd of ispinesib as monotherapy administered as a one hour intravenous infusion on days and of a day cycle in female patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who have not received prior chemotherapy 
once an mtd is determined  the clinical trial is planned to move into phase ii  which 
table of contents is designed to assess the overall response rate of ispinesib in patients with measurable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy  using recist 
in the phase ii portion of this clinical trial  ispinesib is planned to be administered as a one hour intravenous infusion on days and of a day treatment cycle at the mtd determined in phase i 
ovarian cancer in june at the annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology  or asco  gsk presented data from stage of a two stage phase ii trial of ispinesib as monotherapy in patients with platinum taxane refractory or resistant relapsed ovarian cancer 
the primary objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the overall response rate with secondary objectives measuring the median time to radiographic response  median time to ca response  median duration of radiographic response and progression free survival 
the best radiographic response was partial response with a duration of weeks and patients with stable disease 
although a radiographic response was observed  none of the evaluable patients had a ca response and the median time to ca progression was weeks 
in this clinical trial  the protocol specific criteria to proceed to stage were not met 
the most common adverse event was grade neutropenia 
renal cell cancer included in the june asco proceedings was an abstract which presented interim data from a two stage phase ii clinical trial of ispinesib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma sponsored by the nci 
the primary objective of this clinical trial was to assess overall response rate using recist 
secondary objectives included evaluating toxicities  time to progression and overall survival 
in this clinical trial  patients were enrolled and received ispinesib as monotherapy at mg m as a one hour infusion on days  and every days with radiologic disease re evaluation every weeks 
of the evaluable patients included in the interim analysis  the best response observed was stable disease in patients after weeks 
one patient experienced grade neutropenia but no other grade or toxicities were deemed to be attributable to the study drug 
the authors concluded that treatment with ispinesib as a monotherapy at this dose and schedule in this patient population does not appear to lead to objective responses but appears to be well tolerated 
prostate cancer in june  we announced results from stage of the nci s two stage  phase ii clinical trial for the treatment of patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer who had failed taxane based chemotherapy  in which patients received ispinesib as monotherapy at mg m as a hour intravenous infusion every days 
no patients met the primary endpoint of objective response as determined by blood levels of the tumor mass marker prostate specific antigen or psa and the median time to psa or clinical progression was weeks 
ispinesib did not satisfy the criteria for advancement to the second stage and therefore recruitment to stage was not opened 
the most common adverse event was grade neutropenia 
hepatocellular cancer in june  we announced the results from stage of the nci s two stage  phase ii clinical trial for the treatment of hepatocellular cancer  in which patients received ispinesib as monotherapy at mg m as a hour intravenous infusion every days 
the best overall response was stable disease seen in of the patients 
ispinesib did not satisfy the criteria for advancement to the second stage and therefore recruitment to stage was not opened 
the most common adverse event was grade neutropenia 
melanoma in june  we announced the results from stage of the nci s two stage  phase ii clinical trial for the treatment of patients with chemotherapy na ve recurrent or metastatic malignant melanoma  in which patients received ispinesib as monotherapy at mg m as a hour intravenous infusion every days 
the best overall response was stable disease seen in of patients treated 
ispinesib did not satisfy the criteria for advancement to the second stage and therefore recruitment to stage was not opened 
the most frequent grade or hematologic adverse events were neutropenia and lymphopenia 
ispinesib with capecitabine in the second quarter of  gsk concluded patient treatment in a dose escalating  phase ib clinical trial evaluating the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of ispinesib in combination with capecitabine 
in  interim clinical trial data were presented demonstrating that the combination of ispinesib and capecitabine may have an acceptable tolerability profile 
the optimally tolerated regimen in this clinical trial was not defined at that time  however  the mtd of ispinesib as monotherapy mg m  administered as an intravenous infusion every days was tolerated with therapeutic doses of capecitabine  specifically daily oral doses of mg m and mg m for days 
plasma concentrations of ispinesib did not appear to be affected by the presence of capecitabine 
dose limiting toxicities consisted of grade rash that did not allow of the capecitabine doses to be delivered and prolonged grade neutropenia 
in this clinical trial  a total of out of patients had a best response of stable disease as determined by recist 
we anticipate final data 
table of contents from this clinical trial to be available in the first half of the timing of availability of these data is based on information provided by gsk and is outside of our control 
pediatric solid tumors the nci continues to conduct a phase i clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic profile of ispinesib as monotherapy administered as a one hour infusion on days  and of a day schedule to pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors 
acute leukemias  chronic myelogenous leukemia or advanced myelodysplastic syndromes the nci has closed enrollment in a phase i clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of ispinesib as monotherapy administered as a one hour infusion on days  and of a day cycle in adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemias  chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis or advanced myelodysplastic syndromes 
preclinical research at the annual meeting of the american association for cancer research  or aacr  a poster was presented containing data from non clinical studies designed to examine whether spindle disruption by inhibition of ksp with ispinesib may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of multiple myeloma 
the authors concluded that ksp inhibition with ispinesib was able to induce growth arrest and cell death in myeloma cells  and overcome resistance to both conventional drugs and novel agents  such as bortezomib 
they also concluded that ispinesib s preferential activity against transformed plasma cells with the sparing of normal bone marrow cells provides a rationale for the clinical development of ispinesib as a potential treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma 
we expect that it will take several years before we can commercialize ispinesib  if at all 
ispinesib is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if and when we will be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from any resulting drugs 
accordingly  we cannot reasonably estimate when and to what extent ispinesib will generate revenues or material net cash flows  which may vary widely depending on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the safety and efficacy profile of the drug  receipt of regulatory approvals  market acceptance  then prevailing reimbursement policies  competition and other market conditions 
we have assumed responsibility for funding the research and development costs associated with ispinesib pursuant to the november amendment to the gsk agreement 
we have initiated a focused development program for ispinesib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer designed to further define the clinical activity profile of ispinesib in advanced breast cancer patients  and in preparation for potentially initiating a phase iii clinical trial of ispinesib for the second line treatment of advanced breast cancer 
as a result of this planned development activity  or if gsk does not exercise its option to resume responsibility for some or all of the development and commercialization activities associated with this drug candidate  our expenditures relating to research and development of this drug candidate will increase significantly 
sb sb  our second anti cancer drug candidate  also inhibits ksp but is structurally distinct from ispinesib 
sb is also being developed in connection with our strategic alliance with gsk 
though we are aware of no clinical shortcomings of ispinesib that are addressed by sb  we believe that having two ksp inhibitors in concurrent clinical development increases the likelihood that a commercial product will result from this research and development program 
sb was studied by gsk in a dose escalating phase i clinical trial evaluating its safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics in advanced cancer patients 
the primary objectives of this clinical trial were to determine the dose limiting toxicities  or dlts  and to establish the mtd of sb administered intravenously on a once every day schedule 
secondary objectives included assessment of the safety and tolerability of sb  characterization of the pharmacokinetics of sb on this schedule and a preliminary assessment of its anti tumor activity 
the observed toxicities at the recommended phase ii dose were manageable 
dlts in this clinical trial consisted predominantly of neutropenia and elevations in hepatic enzymes and bilirubin 
disease stabilization  ranging from to weeks  was observed in seven patients 
one patient with cholangiocarcinoma had a confirmed partial response at the mtd 
in  we initiated  at our expense  an additional clinical trial of sb in hematologic cancers 
we continue to enroll and dose escalate patients in an open label  non randomized phase i ii clinical trial to investigate the safety  tolerability  pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic profile of sb administered as a one hour 
table of contents infusion on days and of a day schedule in patients with hodgkin or non hodgkin lymphoma 
in december  at the annual meeting of the american society of hematology  a poster was presented summarizing interim data from phase i of this clinical trial 
the authors concluded that sb is well tolerated without prophylactic granulocyte colony stimulating factor at doses less than mg m when given on this alternative dosing schedule 
the best response observed was a partial response in a patient with hodgkin lymphoma at mg m in this interim analysis  grade or neutropenia was the most common toxicity reported and grade or non hematological toxicities have been rare 
in particular  there has been no evidence of neuropathy 
we anticipate final data to be available from the phase i portion of this trial in the first half of the clinical trials program for sb may proceed for several years  and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed  regulatory approval is achieved  and a drug is commercialized 
sb is at too early a stage of development for us to predict when or if this may occur 
the november amendment to the gsk agreement provides for us to fund the future development of sb in all cancer indications subject to gsk s option to resume responsibility for some or all development and commercialization activities 
as a result of our conduct of our current phase i ii clinical trial of sb in hematologic cancers  and any further development activities for sb we may conduct under this amendment  our expenditures relating to research and development of this drug candidate will increase significantly 
if gsk exercises its option for either or both of ispinesib and sb  it will pay us an option fee equal to the costs we independently incurred for the development of that drug candidate  plus a premium intended to compensate us for the cost of capital associated with such costs  subject to an agreed limit for such costs and premium 
upon gsk exercising its option for a drug candidate  we may receive additional pre commercialization milestone payments with respect to such drug candidate and increased royalties on net sales of any resulting product  in each case  beyond those contemplated under the original agreement 
gsk gsk is the third drug candidate to arise from our strategic alliance with gsk 
gsk is an inhibitor of a second mitotic kinesin  centromere associated protein e  or cenp e 
cenp e is directly involved in coordinating the decision a cell makes to divide with the actual trigger of the mechanics of cell division 
these processes are essential for cancer cells to grow 
gsk causes partial and complete shrinkages of human tumors in animal models and has exhibited properties in these studies that distinguish it from ispinesib and sb in august  we announced that gsk had initiated a first time in humans phase i clinical trial of gsk this phase i clinical trial is an open label  non randomized  dose finding trial designed to investigate the safety  tolerability  pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic profile of gsk in patients with advanced solid tumors 
the initiation of this clinical trial triggered a milestone payment of million from gsk to cytokinetics under the gsk agreement 
we anticipate data to be available from this clinical trial in the timing of availability of these data is based on information provided by gsk and is outside of our control 
preclinical data relating to gsk were presented in two posters at the april annual meeting of the aacr 
the authors of one poster concluded that gsk  a potent and selective inhibitor of cenp e  elicited a dose dependent response against a wide variety of human tumor xenografts models in nude mice 
tumor regression was observed in seven of eleven of the models studied 
the mechanism of cell cycle arrest was consistent with that observed in cell culture  as judged by histological examination of tumors in a colon cancer xenograft 
the authors of the second poster  a biochemical analysis of gsk  described its unique mechanism of cenp e inhibition 
this biochemical mechanism of action is consistent with the cellular response and clearly distinguishable from the mitotic kinesin inhibitors ispinesib and monastrol 
in october  at the aacr nci eortc international conference on molecular targets and cancer therapeutics  two posters related to gsk were presented 
the first poster described the antiproliferative activity of gsk across a panel of solid and hematological tumor cell lines 
activity was not limited to any one tumor type and only four of the cell lines tested were fully resistant to treatment with our cenp e inhibitor 
in a second poster  the molecular basis for response to gsk was characterized across a series of cell lines with varying sensitivity and related to the mitotic checkpoint and programmed cell death machinery 

table of contents the development program for gsk may proceed for several years  and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from this potential drug candidate unless the program is successfully completed  regulatory approval is achieved and a drug is commercialized 
gsk is at too early a stage of development for us to predict when or if this may occur 
if gsk abandons development of gsk prior to regulatory approval  we may undertake and fund the clinical development of this drug candidate  or its commercialization  or we may seek a new partner for such clinical development or commercialization  or curtail or abandon such clinical development 
ispinesib  sb and gsk are being developed in connection with the gsk agreement  executed in this strategic alliance is directed to the discovery  development and commercialization of novel small molecule drugs targeting ksp  cenp e and certain other mitotic kinesins for applications in the treatment of cancer and other diseases 
under our strategic alliance  gsk  in collaboration with the nci  conducted a broad phase ii clinical trials program designed to evaluate ispinesib across multiple tumor types  as well as a phase i clinical trial of sb pursuant to a november amendment to the gsk agreement  we assumed responsibility  at our expense  for the continued research  development and commercialization of ispinesib and sb  subject to gsk s option to resume development and commercialization of either or both of ispinesib and sb this option is exercisable during a defined period 
gsk is currently conducting a phase i clinical trial of gsk in june  we amended the gsk agreement to extend the research term for an additional year through june  to facilitate continued research activities under an updated research plan focused on cenp e 
under the june amendment  gsk will have no obligation to reimburse us for full time employee equivalents  or ftes  during the extension of the research term 
for those drug candidates that gsk develops under the strategic alliance  we can elect to co fund certain later stage development activities which would increase our potential royalty rates on sales of resulting drugs and provide us with the option to secure co promotion rights in north america 
if we elect to co fund later stage development  we expect that the royalties to be paid on future sales of each of ispinesib  sb and gsk could potentially increase to an upper teen percentage rate based on increasing product sales and our anticipated level of co funding 
if we exercise our co promotion option  then we are entitled to receive reimbursement from gsk for certain sales force costs we incur in support of our commercial activities 
we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our mitotic kinesin programs of approximately million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our expenditures relating to the development of ispinesib and sb will increase significantly as we advance through clinical development 
our expenditures will also increase if gsk does not exercise its option to resume responsibility for some or all of the development and commercialization activities associated with ispinesib and sb  or if we elect to co fund later stage development for one or more of ispinesib  sb and gsk for those drug candidates and potential drug candidates that gsk develops under the strategic alliance  which currently includes gsk and which may include either or both of ispinesib and sb if so elected by gsk pursuant to its option  we may elect to co fund certain later stage development activities which would increase our potential royalty rates on sales of resulting drugs and provide us with the option to secure co promotion rights in north america 
we expect that the royalties to be paid on potential future sales  if any  by gsk of each of ispinesib  sb and gsk will be based on increasing product sales and our anticipated level of co funding  if any 
if we exercise our co promotion option  then we will receive reimbursement from gsk for certain sales force costs we incur in support of our commercial activities 
development risks the successful development of all of our drug candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot estimate with certainty or know the exact nature  timing and estimated costs of the activities necessary to complete the development of any of our drug candidates or the date of completion of these development activities 
we cannot estimate with certainty any of the foregoing due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing our drug candidates  including  but not limited to the uncertainty of the timing of the initiation and completion of patient enrollment in our clinical trials  the possibility of delays in the collection of clinical trial data and the uncertainty of the timing of the analyses of our clinical trial data after such trials have been initiated and completed  
table of contents the possibility of delays in characterization  synthesis or optimization of potential drug candidates in our cardiovascular program  delays or additional costs in developing appropriate formulations of our drug candidates for clinical trial use  the uncertainty of clinical trial results  the uncertainty of obtaining fda or other foreign regulatory agency approval required for the clinical investigation of new therapies  and the uncertainty related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing processes and qualification of a commercial scale manufacturing facility 
if we fail to complete the development of any of our drug candidates in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
in addition  any failure by us or our partners to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals for our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our programs on schedule  or at all  and certain consequences of failing to do so are discussed further in the risk factors entitled we have never generated  and may never generate  revenues from commercial sales of our drugs and we may not have drugs to market for at least several years  if ever  clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy of our drug candidates  which could prevent or significantly delay completion of clinical development and regulatory approval and clinical trials are expensive  time consuming and subject to delay  as well as other risk factors 
revenues our current revenue sources are limited  and we do not expect to generate any direct revenue from product sales for several years 
we have recognized revenues from our strategic alliances with amgen  gsk and astrazeneca for license fees and contract research activities 
under the terms of our collaboration and option agreement with amgen  or the amgen agreement  we received an upfront  non refundable license and technology access fee of million 
in connection with entering into the collaboration and option agreement  we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement  or the cspa  with amgen 
in january  we issued  shares of our common stock to amgen for net proceeds of million  of which the million purchase premium was recorded as deferred revenue 
we are amortizing the upfront fee and stock premium to license revenue ratably over the maximum term of the non exclusive license  which is four years 
we may receive additional payments from amgen upon achieving certain precommercialization and commercialization milestones 
milestone payments are non refundable and are recognized as revenue when earned  as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of ongoing performance obligations 
we may also be eligible to receive reimbursement for contract development activities subsequent to amgen s option exercise  which we will record as revenue if and when the related expenses are incurred 
we record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue 
charges to gsk in were based on negotiated rates intended to approximate the costs for our ftes performing research under the strategic alliance and our out of pocket expenses  which we recorded as the related expenses were incurred 
gsk paid us an upfront licensing fee  which we recognized ratably over the strategic alliance s initial five year research term  which ended in june in  we received a million milestone payment from gsk relating to its initiation of a phase i clinical trial of gsk we may receive additional payments from gsk upon achieving certain precommercialization milestones 
milestone payments are non refundable and are recognized as revenue when earned  as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of ongoing performance obligations 
we record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue 
the revenues recognized to date are not refundable  even if the relevant research effort is not successful 
charges to astrazeneca in were based on negotiated rates intended to approximate the costs for our ftes performing research under the strategic alliance 
the revenues recognized since inception to date are not refundable 
the research term of our collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca expired in december  and we formally terminated that agreement in august 
table of contents because a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on achieving development and other precommercialization milestones under our strategic alliances with gsk and amgen  our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year 
we expect that our future revenues will most likely be derived from royalties on sales from drugs licensed to gsk or amgen under our strategic alliances and from those licensed to future partners  as well as from direct sales of our drugs 
if amgen exercises its option  we will retain a product by product option to co fund certain later stage development activities under our strategic alliance with amgen  thereby potentially increasing our royalties and affording us co promotion rights in north america 
for those products being developed by gsk under our strategic alliance  we also retain a product by product option to co fund certain later stage development activities  thereby potentially increasing our royalties and affording us co promotion rights in north america 
if we exercise our co promotion rights under either strategic alliance  we are entitled to receive reimbursement for certain sales force costs we incur in support of our commercial activities 
research and development we incur research and development expenses associated with both partnered and unpartnered research activities  as well as the development and expansion of our drug discovery technologies 
research and development expenses related to our strategic alliance with gsk consisted primarily of costs related to research and screening  lead optimization and other activities relating to the identification of compounds for development as mitotic kinesin inhibitors for the treatment of cancer 
prior to june  certain of these costs were reimbursed by gsk on an fte basis 
from through november  gsk funded the majority of the costs related to the clinical development of ispinesib and sb under our november amendment to the gsk agreement  we assumed responsibility for the continued research  development and commercialization of inhibitors of ksp  including ispinesib and sb  and other mitotic kinesins  at our sole expense subject to gsk s option to resume responsibility for the development and commercialization of either or both of ispinesib and sb  exercisable during a defined period 
we also have the option to co fund certain later stage development activities for gsk this commitment and the potential exercise of our co funding option will result in a significant increase in research and development expenses 
we expect to incur research and development expenses in the continued conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials for ck and other of our cardiac myosin activator compounds for the treatment of heart failure and in connection with our early research programs in other diseases  as well as the continued refinement and application of our existing and future proprietary drug discovery technologies 
research and development expenses related to any development and commercialization activities we elect to fund would consist primarily of employee compensation  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and contract research  facilities costs and depreciation of equipment 
from our inception through december   we incurred costs of approximately million for research and development activities relating to the discovery of mitotic kinesin inhibitors  million for our cardiac contractility program  million for our proprietary technologies and million for all other programs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions  including  but not limited to  finance  human resources  legal  business and commercial development and strategic planning 
other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services  including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents 
we anticipate continued increases in general and administrative expenses associated with operating as a publicly traded company 

table of contents stock compensation the following table summarizes stock based compensation related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases for and  which was allocated as follows in thousands years ended december  research and development general and administrative stock based compensation included in operating expenses as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock based compensation arrangements granted under our stock option plans 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in addition  we continue to amortize deferred stock based compensation recorded prior to adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  for stock options granted prior to the initial public offering 
at december   the balance of deferred stock based compensation was million  which we expect to amortize to expense in income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  which is the asset and liability method for accounting and reporting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we have not recorded an income tax provision in the years ended december   and because we had a net taxable loss in each of those periods 
given that we have a history of recurring losses  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million at december  the federal and state operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in and  respectively  if not utilized 
the net operating loss carryforwards include deductions for stock options 
when utilized  the portion related to stock options deductions will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision 
we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively  at december  if not utilized  the federal carryforwards will expire in various amounts beginning in the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where equity transactions resulted in a change of ownership as defined by internal revenue code section during the year ended december   we conducted a study and determined that our use of our federal research credit is subject to such a restriction 
accordingly  we reduced its deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance by million 
as a result  the research credit amount as of december  reflects the restriction on our ability to use the credit 
on january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas the new standard defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit  in our judgment  which is greater than likely to be realized 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin on january  resulted in no fin liability on the balance sheet 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was million 
we are currently not subject to income tax examinations and  in general  all tax years remain open due to net operating losses 
interest and penalties are zero  and our policy to account for interest and penalties is to classify both as income tax expense in the financial statements 
because we have recorded a full valuation allowance on all our deferred tax 
table of contents assets  fin has had no impact on our effective tax rate 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change materially over the next months 
interest and other income and expense interest and other income and expense consist primarily of interest income and interest expense 
interest income is primarily generated from our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
interest expense generally relates to the borrowings under our equipment financing lines 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues increase years ended december  decrease in millions research and development revenues from related party research and development  grant and other revenues license revenues from related parties total revenues we recorded total revenues of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development revenues from related party refers to revenues from our partner gsk  which is also a stockholder of the company 
research and development revenues from gsk of million in consisted of a milestone payment for gsk s initiation of a phase i clinical trial of gsk in patients with solid tumors  and patent expense reimbursements of million 
research and development revenues from gsk of million in consisted of million for the reimbursement of ftes and approximately million for patent expense reimbursements 
research and development revenues from gsk of million in consisted of million for the reimbursement of ftes  million for milestone revenues and million for patent expense reimbursements 
the million milestone revenue received from gsk in related to the gsk s selection of gsk as a development compound under our strategic alliance in the fourth quarter of fte reimbursements from gsk terminated in june due to the conclusion of the research term under the gsk agreement for all mitotic kinesins except cenp e 
fte reimbursements also decreased in compared to as the result of a contractually pre defined change in fte sponsorship 
the fte sponsorship was determined annually by gsk and us in accordance with the annual research plan and contractually predefined fte support levels 
in june  the five year research term of our strategic alliance with gsk was extended for an additional year under an updated research plan focused only on cenp e without corresponding fte reimbursement 
research and development  grant and other revenues of million for the year ended december  consisted entirely of reimbursement for ftes from astrazeneca under our strategic alliance 
the research term of our collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca expired in december  and we formally terminated that agreement in august license revenues from related parties represents license revenue from our strategic alliances with amgen and gsk 
license revenue from amgen was million in and million in  and represented recognition of the upfront license fee and the premium paid on the common stock purchase by amgen 
as of december   our remaining balance of amgen deferred revenue was million 
we are amortizing the amgen deferred revenue on a straight line basis over the maximum term of the non exclusive license granted to amgen under the collaboration and option agreement  which is four years 
license revenue from gsk was zero in  million in and million in the license revenue from gsk was amortized on a straight line basis over the agreement s initial research term  which ended in june we anticipate total revenues for the year ending december  to be approximately million 

table of contents research and development expenses increase years ended december  decrease in millions research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million in compared to  and increased million in compared to the increase in was primarily due to increases of million related to our cardiovascular and oncology clinical trial programs and preclinical outsourcing costs  million for personnel expenses and million for facilities expenses

we recorded these reimbursements as related party revenue 
clinical timelines  likelihood of success and total completion costs vary significantly for each drug candidate and are difficult to estimate 
we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which early research programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and subsequent compliance with applicable regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain and maintain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we expect research and development expenditures to continue to increase in we expect to advance research and development of our drug candidate ck for the potential treatment of heart failure and our drug candidates ispinesib and sb for the potential treatment of cancer 
we anticipate research and development expenses to be in the range of million to million for general and administrative expenses years ended increase december  decrease in millions general and administrative expenses 
table of contents general and administrative expenses increased million in  compared with  and increased million in  compared with the increase in general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to increases in personnel expenses of million  outside services  including audit  accounting and tax fees  of million  and facilities costs of million 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in legal expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in  compared to  was primarily due to increased expenses related to compensation and benefits of million and higher legal fees of million  partially offset by lower outsourcing costs of million 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase during due to higher payroll related expenses in support of our continuing corporate development activities  business development costs  expanding operational infrastructure  and costs associated with being a public company

the maximum number of shares we may issue in any pricing period is the lesser of of our market capitalization immediately prior to the commencement of the pricing period or million 
as part of the arrangement  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  which represents a premium over the closing price of our common stock on the date we entered into the ceff 
this warrant is exercisable beginning six months after the date of grant and for a period of three years thereafter 
under the terms of the ceff  the maximum number of shares we may sell is  exclusive of the shares underlying the warrant which  under the rules of the nasdaq stock market llc  is approximately the maximum number of shares we may sell to kingsbridge without approval of our stockholders 
this limitation may further limit the amount of proceeds we are able to obtain from the ceff

the ceff does not contain any restrictions on our operating activities  any automatic pricing resets or any minimum market volume restrictions 
to date we have made no draw downs under the ceff with kingsbridge 
in january  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with certain institutional investors relating to the issuance and sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  for gross offering proceeds of million

investments as of december  consisted of highly rated municipal auction rate securities 
auction rate securities provide liquidity via a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  usually every days 
this mechanism allows existing investors either to rollover their holdings  whereby they would continue to own their respective interest in the auction rate security  or to gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
as of december   our investment portfolio included million of aaa aaa rated auction rate securities consisting of government supported municipal debt obligations 
none of the auction rate securities in our portfolio are mortgage backed  and  through december   there had been no failed auctions related to these securities 
in january  our auction rate securities with january auction reset dates had successful auctions at which their interest rates were reset 
in february  we liquidated million of our auction rate securities at par  which were classified as short term investments as of december  as of march   million of auction rate securities remained in our portfolio and auctions for these securities failed in february and early march as a result of this development and the remaining uncertainty in the market for auction rate securities  we have classified million of auction rate securities as long term in the accompanying balance sheet as of december  these failures resulted in the interest rates on these investments resetting to contractually stipulated fail rates that are variable based on short term municipal bond or other market indices  or fixed rates that may result in us earning above market interest rates on these investments 
if we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful  the issuer redeems the outstanding securities  the securities mature  or we sell the securities in the secondary market 
in august  we secured a new line of credit with general electric capital corporation  or ge capital  of up to million to finance certain equipment until september  the line of credit is subject to the terms of a master security agreement  or msa  between the company and ge capital  dated february and as amended on march  and related term sheet 
as of december   we had not borrowed any funds under this line 

table of contents as of december   future minimum payments under lease obligations and equipment financing lines were as follows in thousands within two to four to after one year three years five years five years total operating leases equipment financing line total our long term commitments under operating leases relate to payments under our two facility leases in south san francisco  california  which expire in and under the provisions of our amended agreement with portola pharmaceuticals  inc  or portola  we were obligated to reimburse portola for certain equipment costs incurred by portola in connection with research and related services that portola provides to us 
we began to incur these costs when the equipment became available for use in the second quarter of our payments to portola for such equipment costs  totaling  were made in eight quarterly installments commencing in the first quarter of and through the fourth quarter of no further payments are due under this agreement 
in future periods  we expect to incur substantial costs as we continue to expand our research programs and related research and development activities 
we also plan to continue to conduct clinical development of our cardiac myosin activator ck for the potential treatment of heart failure  of ispinesib for the potential treatment of breast cancer and of sb for the potential treatment of hodgkin and non hodgkin lymphoma 
we expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we advance the research and development of our other cardiac myosin activators for the treatment of heart failure  pursue our other early stage research programs in multiple therapeutic areas and continue to refine and apply our existing and future proprietary drug discovery technologies 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the initiation  progress  timing  scope and completion of preclinical research  development and clinical trials for our drug candidates and potential drug candidates  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by requirements of regulatory agencies  if amgen exercises its option  amgen s decisions with regard to funding of development and commercialization of ck or other compounds for the treatment of heart failure under our collaboration  gsk s decisions with regard to future funding of development of our drug candidates and potential drug candidates  including gsk and  if gsk exercises its option  either or both of ispinesib and sb  our level of funding for the development of current or future drug candidates  the number of drug candidates we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  our ability to establish  enforce and maintain selected strategic alliances and activities required for commercialization of our potential drugs  our plans or ability to establish sales  marketing or manufacturing capabilities and to achieve market acceptance for potential drugs  expanding and advancing our research programs  hiring of additional employees and consultants  expanding our facilities  the acquisition of technologies  products and other business opportunities that require financial commitments  and 
table of contents our revenues  if any  from successful development of our drug candidates and commercialization of potential drugs 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  interest earned on investments  proceeds from equipment financings and the potential proceeds from the ceff will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next months 
if  at any time  our prospects for internally financing our research and development programs decline  we may decide to reduce research and development expenses by delaying  discontinuing or reducing our funding of development of one or more of our drug candidates or potential drug candidates 
alternatively  we might raise funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that the funding  if needed  will be available on attractive terms  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
similarly  financing obtained through future co development arrangements may require us to forego certain commercial rights to future drug candidates 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included in this form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
investments we invest in us corporate  municipal and government agency bonds  commercial paper and certificates of deposit 
the maturities of the investments range from three months to one year  with the exception of variable rate obligations as discussed below 
we have classified our investments as available for sale and  accordingly record them at fair value  based on quoted market rates  with unrealized gains and losses reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  until realized or until a determination is made that an other than temporary decline in market value has occurred 
factors considered by management in assessing whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred include the nature of the investment  whether the decline in fair value is attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting the investment  the financial condition of the investee  the severity and the duration of the impairment  and whether we have the ability to hold the investment to maturity 
when we determine that an other than temporary impairment has occurred  the investment is written down to its market value at the end of the period in which we determine that an other than temporary decline has occurred 
the cost of marketable securities sold is based upon the specific identification method 
we determined that no impairment of our investments existed at december  in addition  we classify investments as short term or long term based upon whether such assets are reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the business 

table of contents the balance of our investments in auction rate securities was million at december  and million at december  due to the resetting variable rates of these securities  their fair value generally approximates cost 
there were no realized gains or losses from these investments during the years ended december   or and no cumulative unrealized gain or loss at december  or we recorded all income generated from these investments as interest income 
there had been no failed auctions on any of our auction rate securities through december  and we deemed that no impairment existed as of that date 
at december   we classified million of our investment in auction rate securities as long term due to the uncertainty as to whether such securities will be available for current operations 
see note for additional details on our investment portfolio and events occurring subsequent to december  that impacted the classification of auction rate securities in our balance sheet 
all other available for sale investments are classified as short or long term investments according to their contractual maturities 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for research performed and milestones met  and the collectability of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
research and development revenues  which are earned under agreements with third parties for contract research and development activities  may include nonrefundable license fees  research and development funding  cost reimbursements and contingent milestones and royalties 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are evaluated under emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
nonrefundable license fees are recognized as revenue as we perform under the applicable agreement 
where the level of effort is relatively consistent over the performance period  we recognize total fixed or determined revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated period of expected performance 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone  provided the milestone payment is nonrefundable  substantive effort and risk is involved in achieving the milestone and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if these conditions are not met  we defer the milestone payment and recognize it as revenue over the estimated period of performance under the contract as we complete our performance obligations 
research and development revenues and cost reimbursements are based upon negotiated rates for our ftes and actual out of pocket costs 
fte rates are intended to approximate our anticipated costs 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue 
none of the revenues recognized to date are refundable if the relevant research effort is not successful 
in revenue arrangements in which both parties make payments to each other  we evaluate the payments in accordance with the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products to determine whether payments made by us will be recognized as a reduction of revenue or as expense 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue we recognize may be reduced by payments made to the other party under the arrangement unless we receive a separate and identifiable benefit in exchange for the payments and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
the application of eitf issue no 
has had no impact to us 
grant revenues are recorded as research is performed and are not refundable 

table of contents preclinical study and clinical trial accruals a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros  and other vendors 
for preclinical studies  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the percentage of work completed to date and contract milestones achieved 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled  duration of enrollment and percentage of work completed to date 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and status meetings with cros and review of contractual terms 
our estimates are dependent on the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by our cros and other vendors 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate data  we may under or overestimate activity levels associated with various studies or clinical trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity levels become known 
no material adjustments to preclinical study and clinical trial expenses have been recognized to date 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  which establishes accounting for share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases 
under no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the employee s requisite service period  generally the vesting period of the award 
we elected the modified prospective transition method for awards granted subsequent to april   the date of our initial public offering  and the prospective transition method for awards granted prior to our initial public offering 
prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes under either transition method 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and related interpretations 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and complied with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods  or services 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions we use to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the financial statements  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to zero  because we believe that  based upon a number of factors  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
in july  the fasb issued fin fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant 
table of contents facts 
we adopted fin on january  the cumulative effect of adopting fin was recorded net in deferred tax assets  which resulted in no fin liability on the balance sheet 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was million 
see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements  note income taxes for additional information 
as of december   our unrecognized tax benefits were million 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies under the other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurement 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years  for all financial assets and liabilities and for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value at least annually 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  for all other nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively 
we do not expect that the adoption of the requirements of sfas that are effective on january  will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
that will become effective for it on january   and have not yet determined the impact  if any  on the financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for us on january  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf issue no 
states that nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
entities should then continue to evaluate whether they expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
eitf issue no 
will be effective for us on january  and is to be applied prospectively for new contracts entered into on or after the effective date 
we are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statements of adopting eitf issue no 
in november  the eitf issued a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaboration arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property  which is focused on how the parties to a collaborative agreement should account for costs incurred and revenue generated on sales to third parties  how shared payments pursuant to a collaboration agreement should be presented in the income statement and certain related disclosure questions 
eitf issue no 
is to be applied retrospectively for collaboration arrangements in fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact on its financial statements of adopting eitf issue no 
in december  the sec issued sab no 
 which addresses the continued use of the simplified method for estimating the expected term for stock based compensation 
previously  under sab no 
 share based payment  the use of the simplified method was intended to be discontinued after december  under sab no 
 companies may continue to use the simplified method in certain circumstances 
we have used the simplified method of estimating the expected term for stock based compensation since its adoption of sfas no 
r on january   and are in the process of determining the effect  if any  the adoption of sab no 
on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest a portion of our excess cash in debt instruments of high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure in any one issuer and investment class 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including us government and agency securities  high grade municipal and us corporate bonds  commercial paper  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
our investment portfolio of short term investments is subject to interest rate risk  and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
as of december   our investments consist of highly rated municipal auction rate securities 
auction rate securities provide liquidity via a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  or auction reset dates  usually every days 
this mechanism allows existing investors either to roll over their holdings  whereby they would continue to own their respective interest in the auction rate security  or to gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
see further discussion of our investment securities portfolio and auction rate securities holdings in the liquidity and capital resources section of item of this form k 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase  consequently  we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to significant interest rate risk and have therefore excluded them from the table below 
on the liability side  our equipment financing lines carry fixed interest rates and therefore also may be subject to changes in fair value if market interest rates fluctuate 
we do not have any foreign currency or derivative financial instruments 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and equipment financing lines dollars in thousands fair value at december  beyond total assets investments average interest rate liabilities equipment financing lines average interest rate
