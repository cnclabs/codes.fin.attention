prospects for growth over recent decades  global fixed income markets have grown significantly in terms of outstanding principal amount and types of securities or other obligations 
despite the recent market disruption and decline in issuance activity for some important classes of securities in the us and internationally  moody s believes that the overall long term outlook remains favorable for continued secular growth of fixed income markets worldwide 
however  moody s expects that  in the near term  growth drivers such as financial innovation and disintermediation will slow as capital market participants adjust to the recent poor performance of some structured finance asset classes  such as us residential mortgage backed securities and credit derivatives 
restoring investor confidence in structured products will require enhancements to moody s rating processes and probably greater transparency from issuers of structured or securitized debt 
moody s is developing updated rating methodologies  volatility measures  and pricing and valuation services to aid the return of investor trust and  though it is likely to be a measured process  moody s expects that these initiatives will support continued long term demand for high quality  independent credit opinions 
growth in global fixed income markets is attributable to a number of forces and trends 
advances in information technology  such as the internet  make information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world 
this technology facilitates issuers ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets 
issuers and investors are also more readily able to obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell  many of which may be unfamiliar to them 
this availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and development of worldwide financial markets and a greater need for credible  globally comparable opinions about credit risk 
as a result  existing capital markets have expanded and a number of new capital markets have emerged 
in addition  more issuers and investors are accessing developed capital markets 
another trend that is driving growth in the world s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems 
issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets  in addition to  or in substitution for  traditional financial intermediaries 
moreover  financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets  in addition to or instead of retaining those assets 
recent credit market disruptions have slowed the trend of disintermediation in important markets such as the us and europe  but moody s believes that debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to the traditional banking systems 
thus  disintermediation is expected to expand in the longer term 
growth in issuance of structured finance securities has generally been stronger than growth in straight corporate and financial institutions debt issuance  though with recent market turmoil this trend is expected to change at least over the near term  and possibly longer  with investors preferring simpler  more standardized and more transparent securities to more complex financial instruments 
compared with  moody s expects a decline in structured finance revenue at least through and possibly into and beyond 
rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of moody s investors service 
therefore  a substantial portion of moody s revenue is dependent upon the volume and number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets that moody s rates 
moody s is therefore affected by  for example  the performance  and the prospects for growth  of the major world economies  the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments  and the decisions of issuers to request moody s ratings to aid investors in their investment decision process 
however  annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers  annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and medium term note programs  bank and insurance company financial strength ratings  mutual fund ratings  subscription based research and other areas are less dependent on  or independent of  the volume or number of debt securities issued in the global capital markets 
moody s operations are also subject to various risks inherent in carrying on business internationally 
such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization  expropriation  exchange and price controls  changes in the availability of data from public sector sources  limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions 
management believes that the risks of nationalization or expropriation are reduced because the company s basic service is the creation and dissemination of information  rather than the production of products that require manufacturing facilities or the use of natural resources 
however  the formation of  for example  a new government sponsored regional or global rating agency would pose a risk to moody s growth prospects 
management believes that this risk  compared to other regulatory changes under consideration for the credit rating industry  is relatively low because of the likelihood that substantial investments over a sustained period would be required  with uncertainty about the likelihood of financial success 
legislative bodies and regulators in both the united states  europe and selective other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of credit rating agencies  which may result in  for example  an increased number of competitors  changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of moody s investors service  or increased costs of doing business for moody s 
therefore  in order to broaden the potential for expansion of non ratings services  beginning in january  moody s has reorganized into two distinct businesses  moody s investors service  consisting solely of the ratings business  and moody s analytics 
moody s analytics now conducts all non ratings activities  and includes the mkmv business  the sale of credit research produced by moody s investors service and the production and sale of other credit related products and services 
the reorganization is expected to broaden the opportunities for expansion by moody s analytics into activities which were previously restricted  due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business 
at present  moody s is unable to assess the nature and effect any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities 
see regulation below 
moody s analytics expects to benefit from the growing demand among credit market participants for information that enables them to make sound investment and risk management decisions 
these customers require advanced qualitative and quantitative tools to support their management of increasingly complex capital market instruments 
such complexity creates analytical challenges for market participants  including financial intermediaries  asset managers and other investors 
in recent years  reliable third party ratings and research served to supplement or substitute for traditional in house research as the scale  geographic scope and complexity of financial markets grew 
recent disruptions in credit markets threaten to slow this trend  but moody s expects to sustain reliance on its offerings as enhancements to credit rating methodologies and other changes in securities origination processes restore investor confidence and more orderly market operations 
growth in moody s analytics is also expected as financial institutions adopt active credit portfolio management practices and implement internal credit assessment tools for compliance with basel ii regulations 
moody s analytics offers products that respond to these needs 
this growth will be realized by  for example  the development of new private firm default probability models for specific countries and by expanding analysis capabilities of new asset classes 
competition the moody s investors service business competes with other credit rating agencies and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research 
many of our customers also have in house credit research capabilities 
moody s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is standard poor s ratings services s p  a division of the mcgraw hill companies  inc there are some rating markets  based on industry  geography and or instrument type  in which moody s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to s p s 
in other markets  the reverse is true 
in addition to s p  moody s competitors include fitch  a subsidiary of fimalac sa  dominion bond rating service  ltd 
of canada dbrs and am best company  inc in  japan credit rating agency  ltd  rating and investment information  inc  r i and egan jones also were designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsro  and in february  lace financial corp 
also was registered as an nrsro 
one or more additional rating agencies may emerge in the united states as the securities and exchange commission sec continues to expand the number of nrsros 
competition may also increase in developed or developing markets outside the united states over the next few years as the number of rating agencies increases 
financial regulators are reviewing their approach to supervision and have sought or are seeking comments on changes to the global regulatory framework that could affect moody s 
bank regulators  under the oversight of the basel committee on banking supervision  have proposed using refined risk assessments as the basis for minimum capital requirements 
the proposed standardized approach relies on rating agency opinions  while the proposed internal ratings based approach relies on systems and processes maintained by the regulated bank 
the increased regulatory focus on credit risk presents both opportunities and challenges for moody s 
global demand for credit ratings and risk management services may rise  but regulatory actions may result in a greater number of rating agencies and or additional regulation of moody s and its competitors 
alternatively  banking or securities market regulators could seek to reduce the use of ratings in regulations  thereby reducing certain elements of demand for ratings  or otherwise seek to control the analysis or business of rating agencies 
credit rating agencies such as moody s also compete with other means of managing credit risk  such as credit insurance 
competitors that develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk also may pose a competitive threat to moody s 
moody s analytics main competitors for quantitative measures of default risk include the riskmetrics group  s p  creditsights  r i s financial technology institute  fitch algorithmics  dun and bradstreet  and other smaller vendors  as well as models developed internally by customers 
other firms may compete in the future 
baker hill  acquired by experian  and bureau van dijk electronic publishing are moody s analytics main competitors in the market for analytical software supporting commercial lending activities 
mercer oliver wyman competes with the professional services group at moody s analytics for certain credit risk consulting services business 
in economic analysis  data and modeling services  moody s analytics faces competition from global insight  haver analytics and a number of smaller firms around the world 
moody s strategy moody s intends to focus on the following opportunities expansion in financial centers moody s serves its customers through its global network of offices and business affiliations 
moody s currently maintains comprehensive rating and marketing operations in financial centers including frankfurt  hong kong  london  madrid  milan  moscow  new york  paris  singapore  sydney and tokyo 
moody s expects that its global network will position it to benefit from the expansion of worldwide capital markets and thereby increase revenue 
moody s also expects that the growth of its moody s investors service business as a consequence of financial market integration in europe will continue 
additionally  moody s expects to continue its expansion into developing markets either directly or through joint ventures 
this will allow moody s to extend its credit opinion franchise to local and regional obligors  through domestic currency ratings and national scale ratings 
new rating products moody s is pursuing numerous initiatives to expand credit ratings  including from public fixed income securities markets to other sectors with credit risk exposures 
within established capital markets  moody s continues to expand its rating coverage of bank loans and project finance loans and securities 
in global and local counterparty markets  moody s offers distinct sets of rating products to address the creditworthiness of financial firms  including bank financial strength and deposit ratings  and insurance financial strength ratings 
moody s has also introduced issuer ratings for corporations not active in the debt markets 
in response to growing investor demand for expanded credit opinion in the high yield market  moody s has introduced a number of new products  including joint default analysis  corporate financial metrics  and both loss given default and probability of default ratings 
the recent disruptions in the structured finance markets may provide opportunities to enhance structured finance offerings to meet investor demands for more information content 
in order to capitalize on market developments and to enhance ratings surveillance efficiency  moody s has created a new products group within moody s investors service to focus on new ratings products  such as hedge fund operations quality ratings  and to identify  design  develop and maintain value added research  analytics and data products serving the capital markets 
internet enhanced products and services moody s is expanding its use of the internet and other electronic media to enhance client service 
moody s website provides the public with instant access to ratings and provides the public and subscribers with credit research 
internet delivery also enables moody s to provide services to more individuals within a client organization than were available with paper based products and to offer higher value services because of more timely delivery 
moody s expects that access to these applications will increase client use of moody s services 
moody s expects to continue to invest in electronic media to capitalize on these and other opportunities 
expansion of credit research products and investment analytic tools moody s plans to expand its research and analytic services through internal development and through acquisitions 
most new product initiatives tend to be more analytical and data intensive than traditional narrative research offerings 
such services address investor interest in replicating the monitoring activities conducted by  for example  moody s securitization analysts and provide the means for customers to gain access to raw data and adjusted financial statistics and ratios used by moody s analysts in the rating process for municipalities  companies and financial institutions 
these products represent important sources of growth for the research business 
moody s analytics is developing products in the fixed income valuations and pricing arena that facilitate price transparency in global fixed income markets  especially for complex structured securities and derivative instruments 
moreover  moody s continues to explore opportunities to extend its research relevance in new domestic or regional markets eg  china as well as new functional markets eg  hedge funds 
new quantitative credit risk assessment services moody s will continue to provide banks and other institutions with quantitative credit risk assessment services 
moody s believes that there will be increased demand for such services because they assist customers trading or holding credit sensitive assets to better manage risk and deliver better performance 
also  international bank regulatory authorities are assessing the adequacy of banks internal credit risk management systems for the purpose of determining regulatory capital 
such regulatory initiatives create demand for  and encourages adoption of  related services by banks from third party providers 
regulation in the united states  since  moody s investors service mis has been designated as an nrsro by the sec 
the sec first applied the nrsro designation in that year to companies whose credit ratings could be used by broker dealers for purposes of determining their net capital requirements 
since that time  congress  the sec and other governmental and private bodies have used the ratings of nrsros to distinguish between  among other things  investment grade and non investment grade securities 
in september  the credit rating agency reform act of reform act was passed  which created a voluntary registration process for rating agencies wishing to be designated as nrsros 
the reform act provides the sec with authority to oversee nrsros  while prohibiting the sec from regulating the substance of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which any nrsro determines credit ratings 
in june  the sec published final rules to implement the reform act  which address the nrsro application and registration process  as well as oversight rules related to recordkeeping  financial reporting  prevention of misuse of material non public information  conflicts of interest  and prohibited acts and practices 
in june  mis submitted to the sec its application for registration as an nrsro and in september the sec registered mis as an nrsro under the securities exchange act of consequently  mis is now subject to the sec s oversight rules described above and  as required by the rules  has made its form nrsro initial application publicly available by posting it on the regulatory affairs page of the company s website 
internationally  several regulatory developments have occurred the group of finance minister and central bank authorities g after their october meeting  the g published a joint statement outlining their intended approach to the recent financial turbulence 
in this statement  the finance ministers formally asked the financial stability forum fsf to analyze the underlying causes of the turbulence and to provide an update at the g s meetings in late spring the g identified the following four areas on which it would like the fsf to offer proposals liquidity and risk management  accounting and valuation of financial derivatives  role  methodologies and use of credit rating agencies in structured finance  and basic supervisory principles of prudential oversight  including the treatment of off balance sheet vehicles 
the fsf has been working on this request and is expected to provide its recommendations at the g s spring meeting 
iosco in april  the technical committee of the international organization of securities commissions iosco announced that it would reconstitute the task force on rating agencies to undertake a new mandate on the role of credit rating agencies in relation to the development of structured finance products 
this work is to be carried out in close cooperation with the committee on the global financial system cgfs 
in november  iosco announced the creation of a new and dedicated task force to review the issues facing securities regulators following the recent events in the global credit markets 
the topics which will be covered by this task force include risk management prudential supervision  transparency due diligence  valuation of assets accounting issues  and  credit rating agencies 
it is anticipated that the task force will present its final report to the technical committee in may during iosco s annual conference in paris 
in december  the technical committee of iosco published its code of conduct fundamentals for credit rating agencies iosco code 
mis initially published its code of professional conduct mis code pursuant to the iosco code in june and published an updated moody s code in october in december  mis published its second  annual report on the implementation of the moody s code 
the two annual reports and the mis code can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company s website 
european union the european commission commission stated in january and again in january that recent european union eu financial services legislative measures that are relevant to credit rating agencies  combined with a self regulatory framework for rating agencies based on the iosco code  provided a suitable framework for the oversight of rating agencies and that no legislative actions were required at the time 
the committee of european securities regulators cesr has been charged with monitoring rating agencies compliance with the iosco code and reporting back to the commission regularly 
cesr conducted its first annual review to assess such compliance during and published its report in january cesr concluded that four internationally active rating agencies operating in the eu  including moody s  are largely compliant with the iosco code  and it identified a few areas where it believed rating agencies could improve their processes and disclosures and where the iosco code could be improved 
cesr began its second annual review in and is evaluating the areas identified in its report  the impact of the reform act on the ratings business in the european union  and the role of rating agencies in the structured finance process  including securitizations backed by subprime residential mortgages 
as part of cesr s review process  cesr has on two occasions requested comments from rating agencies and other market participants 
the written responses mis submitted to the cesr questionnaires can be found on the regulatory affairs page of the company s website 
cesr plans to publish its second annual report in mid the basel committee in june  the basel committee on banking supervision published a new bank capital adequacy framework basel ii to replace its initial framework 
under basel ii  ratings assigned by recognized credit rating agencies called external credit assessment institutions or ecais can be used by banks in determining credit risk weights for many of their institutional credit exposures 
recognized ecais could be subject to a broader range of oversight 
national authorities have begun the ecai recognition process 
moody s has been recognized as an ecai in several jurisdictions and the recognition process is ongoing in many others 
moody s does not currently believe that basel ii will materially affect its financial position or results of operations 
in addition  as a result of the recent events in the us subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly  various national and global regulatory and other authorities have initiated  or indicated that they are considering  reviews of the role of rating agencies in the us subprime mortgage backed securitization market and structured finance more generally 
moody s is the subject of a number of such reviews and cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such current or potential future reviews  or their ultimate impact on the competitive position  financial position or results of operations of moody s 
other legislation and regulation relating to credit rating and research services has been considered from time to time by local  national and multinational bodies and is likely to be considered in the future 
in certain countries  governments may provide financial or other support to locally based rating agencies 
in addition  governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers 
if enacted  any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which moody s operates 
in addition  the legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future 
management of moody s cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted  the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings  or regulatory or legislative actions  or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position  financial position or results of operations of moody s

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations 
if any of the following risks occurs  moody s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and or global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets approximately of moody s revenue in was derived from ratings 
revenues from ratings  in turn  are dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets 
accordingly  any conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which moody s provides ratings services  and thereby  have an adverse effect on the fees derived from the issuance of ratings 
factors that could reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers willingness or ability to issue such securities include unfavorable financial or economic conditions 
in addition  increases in interest rates or credit spreads  volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment  significant regulatory  political or economic events  defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively affect the general level of debt issuance and or the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers 
beginning in july  there has been a significant disruption in world financial markets  particularly in the credit markets 
a sustained period of market decline or weakness  especially if it relates to credit sensitive securities  for which there is typically a high level of demand for ratings  could have a material adverse effect on moody s business and financial results 
the company has recently noted a substantial reduction in the volume of debt securities issued and related revenues as a result of the uncertainties presently being experienced in the market for collateralized debt and other structured finance obligations 
revenue earned from ratings in was approximately higher as compared to  however  ratings revenue in the second half of compared to the second half of decreased approximately due to the reduced number of credit sensitive securities issued in the latter half of as a result of the credit turmoil beginning early in the third quarter of there can be no assurance that market conditions will improve in the near future or that results will not continue to be adversely affected 
to the extent that any concerns affecting credibility are perceived in the marketplace moody s market share and or revenue could be affected moody s reputation is one key factor on the basis of which it competes 
moody s is constantly taking steps to help maintain the absolute trustworthiness of its reputation  as well as its credibility in the marketplace 
accordingly  to the extent that rating agency business as a whole or moody s  relative to its competitors  suffers a loss in credibility  moody s business could be adversely affected 
factors that could affect one s credibility include  potentially  the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities by a particular rating agency  as well as the ability to recognize potential changes in ratings on a timely basis 
increased pricing pressure from competitors and or customers in the credit rating  research and credit risk management markets  competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service 
while moody s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and service  if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors  moody s may lose market share 
introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies the markets for credit ratings  research and credit risk management services are highly competitive 
the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and to utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share 
competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable  more cost effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody s 
moody s growth prospects could also be adversely affected by limitations of its information technologies that fail to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors 
regulation as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization and potential for new us  state and local legislation and regulations when governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated  establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings  the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected 
government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness 
in these circumstances  debt issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility  and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating  which may negatively affect the company 
in the united states and other countries  the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and are presently subject to review by a number of legislative or regulatory bodies  including the sec in the united states and state and local oversight 
it is possible that such reviews could lead to greater oversight or regulation concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies 
such additional regulations could  potentially  increase the costs associated with the operation of a credit rating agency  alter the rating agencies communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process  increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings  change the regulatory framework to which credit rating agencies are subject and or affect the competitive environment in which credit rating agencies operate 
currently  moody s is designated as an nrsro pursuant to sec regulation enacted in response to the adoption of the reform act 
one of the central promises of the reform act was to encourage competition among rating agencies 
given its recent adoption  moody s is unable to assess the future impact of any regulatory changes that may result from the sec s regulations or the impact on moody s competitive position or its current practices  although moody s would expect the reform act to increase costs of all entities engaged in the rating agency business 
similarly  at present  moody s is unable to predict the regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by any of the various regulatory bodies or the effect that any such changes may have on its business 
a description of several of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the united states and other countries is described above under the section entitled regulation in item business  of this form k 
potential for increased competition and regulation in foreign jurisdictions moody s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant and increasing portion of its revenue from sources outside the us operations in different countries expose moody s to a number of legal  economic and regulatory risks such as restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into us dollars and currency fluctuations  export and import restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  political and economic instability as well as nationalization  expropriation  price controls and other restrictive governmental actions  longer payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
moody s faces competition from  among others  s p  fitch  dbrs  local rating agencies in a number of international jurisdictions and specialized companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company  inc  with respect to the insurance industry 
since moody s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the us  it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets 
these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions that moody s does not receive  putting moody s at a competitive disadvantage 
because moody s operates globally and plans to expand its international scope  it must also react to regulatory changes abroad 
cesr has monitored rating agencies compliance with the iosco code 
although the cesr recently concluded in a report that the four internationally active rating agencies that operate in the european union  including moody s  are largely compliant with the iosco code  it did identify a few areas where it believed the rating agencies could improve their processes and disclosures and where the iosco code could be improved 
cesr indicated that it will look into these areas in particular  as well as the impact of the reform act and the sec s implementing rules on the rating business in the european union 
moody s is unable to assess the potential impact of any regulatory changes that may result from the cesr s review  including whether any additional regulation would restrict or otherwise inhibit moody s expansion into foreign markets 
see the discussion under the section entitled regulation in item business  of this form k  for additional information regarding the iosco code and the cesr 
exposure to litigation related to moody s rating opinions currently  moody s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and governmental authorities  as part of ongoing investigations  and is cooperating with those inquiries 
the outcome of such investigations is presently unknown 
in addition  moody s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions  as well as other related actions 
as moody s international business expands  these types of claims may increase or become more costly because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the us such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the first amendment and criminal rather than civil penalties 
these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify  and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time 
possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures moody s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled  experienced financial analysts and other professionals 
competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense  and moody s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries 
investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than moody s or subject employees to less individual scrutiny 
moody s also may not be able to identify and hire employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis 
moody s may lose key employees due to other factors  such as catastrophes  that could lead to disruption of business operations 
moody s ability to compete effectively will continue to depend  among other things  on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees 
our operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications or other services used by us or third parties with or through whom we conduct business  whether due to human error  natural disasters  power loss  telecommunication failures  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism  acts of terrorism or war or otherwise 
we do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and low risk systems  and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non essential services 
if a disruption occurs in one of these locations and our personnel in those locations are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations  our ability to service and interact with our clients and customers from these locations may suffer 
our operations also rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant  our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious events that could have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  this could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our  our clients  our counterparties or third parties operations 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us

item legal proceedings from time to time  moody s is involved in legal and tax proceedings  governmental investigations  claims and litigation that are incidental to the company s business  including claims based on ratings assigned by moody s 
moody s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business 
management periodically assesses the company s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available 
moody s discloses material pending legal proceedings  other than routine litigation incidental to moody s business  material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities  and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate 
for matters  except those related to income taxes  where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  the company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate 
in other instances  because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss  management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant 
as additional information becomes available  the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 
for income tax matters  the company employs the prescribed methodology of fasb interpretation no

the company except where otherwise indicated  the terms moody s and the company refer to moody s corporation and its subsidiaries 
moody s is a provider of i credit ratings and related research  data and analytical tools  ii quantitative credit risk measures  risk scoring software  and credit portfolio management solutions and iii beginning in january  fixed income pricing data and valuation models 
in and prior years  moody s operated in two reportable segments moody s investors service and moody s kmv mkmv 
beginning in january  moody s segments were changed to reflect the business reorganization announced in august as a result of the reorganization  the rating agency remains in the moody s investors service operating company and several ratings business lines have been realigned 
all of moody s other commercial activities  including mkmv and sales of mis research  are now combined under a new operating company known as moody s analytics 
moody s investors service publishes rating opinions on a broad range of credit obligors and credit obligations issued in domestic and international markets  including various corporate and governmental obligations  structured finance securities and commercial paper programs 
it also publishes investor oriented credit information  research and economic commentary  including in depth research on major debt issuers  industry studies  special comments and credit opinion handbooks 
the mkmv business develops and distributes quantitative credit risk assessment products and services including credit processing software and analytical tools for credit portfolio management 
prior to september   the company operated as part of the dun bradstreet corporation old d b 
on september   the board of directors of old d b approved a plan to separate into two publicly traded companies the company and the new d b corporation new d b 
on september  the distribution date  old d b distributed to its shareholders all of the outstanding shares of new d b common stock the distribution 
new d b comprised the business of old d b s dun bradstreet operating company the d b business 
the remaining business of old d b consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services the moody s business and was renamed moody s corporation 
new d b is the accounting successor to old d b  which was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on april  old d b began operating as an independent publicly owned corporation on july  as a result of its june  spin off the distribution from the corporation now known as rh donnelley corporation and previously known as the dun bradstreet corporation donnelley 
old d b became the accounting successor to donnelley at the time of the distribution 
prior to the distribution  donnelley was the parent holding company for subsidiaries then engaged in the businesses currently conducted by new d b  moody s and donnelley 
prior to november   it also was the parent holding company of subsidiaries conducting business under the names cognizant corporation cognizant and acnielsen corporation acnielsen 
on that date donnelley effected a spin off of the capital stock of cognizant and acnielsen to its stockholders the distribution 
cognizant subsequently changed its name to nielsen media research  inc in connection with its spin off of the capital stock of ims health incorporated ims health 
for purposes of governing certain ongoing relationships between the company and new d b after the distribution and to provide for an orderly transition  the company and new d b entered into various agreements including a distribution agreement  tax allocation agreement  employee benefits agreement  shared transaction services agreement  insurance and risk management services agreement  data services agreement and transition services agreement 
detailed descriptions of the  and distributions are contained in the company s annual report on form k  filed on march  critical accounting estimates moody s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires moody s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  moody s evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  contingencies  goodwill and intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
revenue recognition in recognizing revenue related to ratings  moody s uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where the company does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer 
these judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties  but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods 
in such cases  the company defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods 
the portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors  including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers 
the monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities 
currently  the estimated monitoring periods range from one to ten years 
at december   and  deferred revenue included approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to such monitoring fees 
additionally  in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities  derivatives  international residential mortgage backed and asset backed securities  issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront 
these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods  ranging from nine to years  which are based on the expected lives of the rated securities 
at december   and  deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
moody s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which  in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee  issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding 
revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available 
the estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data 
at december   and  accounts receivable included approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to accrued commercial paper revenue 
historically  the company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 
accounts receivable allowance moody s records  as reductions of revenue  provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings based on historical experience and current conditions 
such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance 
adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance 
moody s evaluates its accounts receivable by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts 
moody s also considers the economic environment of the customers  both from an industry and geographic perspective  in evaluating the need for allowances 
based on its reviews  moody s establishes or adjusts allowances as considered appropriate in the circumstance 
this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts 
accordingly  moody s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions 
however  significant changes in any of the above factors  or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in revenue adjustments that are greater or less than moody s estimates 
in each of  and  the company adjusted its provision rates and its allowances to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance 
contingencies accounting for contingencies  including those matters described in the contingencies section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations  commencing on page is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome 
in many cases  the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties  including governmental or judicial bodies 
the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements  as well as the related disclosures  represent management s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate 
the company regularly reviews contingencies and as additional information becomes available may  in the future  adjust its associated liabilities 
based on its review of the latest information available  and subject to the contingencies described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contingencies  the ultimate liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on moody s future reported results and financial position 
for the years ended december   and  the provision for income taxes reflected credits of million  million and million  respectively  due to changes in the company s liabilities for legacy income tax exposures that were assumed by moody s in connection with its separation from old d b in october these tax matters are more fully described under the caption legacy contingencies within item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets moody s evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill requires that the company make important assumptions and judgments about future operating results and cash flows as well as terminal values and discount rates 
in estimating future operating results and cash flows  moody s considers internal budgets and strategic plans  expected long term growth rates  and the effects of external factors and market conditions 
if actual future operating results and cash flows or external conditions differ from the company s judgments  or if changes in assumed terminal values or discount rates are made  an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill  which charge could be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
restructuring charge the company has engaged  and may continue to engage  in restructuring actions  which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs  contract termination costs and asset impairments 
if the actual amounts differ from these estimates  the amount of the restructuring charge could be impacted 
for a full description of moody s restructuring actions  refer to the results of operations section below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other post retirement benefits the expenses  assets  liabilities and obligations that moody s reports for pension and other post retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances 
these assumptions include the following future compensation increases  based on the company s long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets  based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan s portfolio which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments future healthcare cost trends  based on historical market data  near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates  based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds the discount rate selected to measure the present value of the company s benefit obligations as of december  was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve 
the cash flows are then discounted back to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined 
moody s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in determining these assumptions  the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate 
while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses  assets and liabilities related to the company s pension and other post retirement benefits 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise 
to the extent the total outstanding gain or loss exceeds a corridor threshold as defined in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
 the excess is subject to amortization in annual expense over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants 
for moody s pension and other post retirement benefit plans  the total losses as of december  which have not been recognized in annual expense are million and in  moody s expects amortization of actuarial losses to be immaterial 
for moody s funded pension plan  the differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense 
as permitted under sfas no 
 the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets which is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization 
as of december   the company has an unrecognized asset gain of million  of which million will be recognized in the market related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of expense 
the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody s operating income dollars in millions 
these effects have been calculated using the company s current projections of assets  liabilities  obligations and expenses related to pension and other post retirement plans  which could change as updated data becomes available 
assumption used for estimated impact on operating income decrease increase discount rate weighted average assumed compensation growth rate assumed long term rate of return on pension assets discount rates of and are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect projected expenses 
based on current projections  the company estimates that expenses related to pension and post retirement plans will be approximately million in compared with million in  excluding the costs of curtailment and special termination benefits of million in the expected expense decrease in reflects the effects of higher discount rates  lower amortization of actuarial losses and reduction in workforce due to restructuring  which are partially offset by lower plan asset gains 
stock based compensation on january   the company implemented  under the modified prospective application method  the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r 
under this pronouncement  companies are required to record compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant 
this includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
previously  on january   the company implemented  on a prospective basis  the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable 
some of the assumptions and estimates  such as share price volatility and expected option holding period  are based in part on moody s experience during the period since becoming a public company  which is limited 
the use of different assumptions and estimates in the black scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 
an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in dollars in millions assumption used increase in assumption estimated impact on operating income in increase decrease average expected dividend yield grants average expected share price volatility grants expected option holding period grants years year income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
the company s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for service provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as inter company transactions 
the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
therefore  income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes  and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 
moody s is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy and other tax matters 
the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of its fin no 
tax liabilities 
on january   upon the implementation of fin no 
 the company implemented the accounting policy to classify interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company s consolidated financial statements and to classify associated penalties  if any  as part of other non operating expenses 
prior to the implementation of fin no 
 the company had classified interest related to income taxes and associated penalties as components of income tax expense 
in accordance with fin no 
 prior period financial statements have not been reclassified for this change 
fin no 
requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date  assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 
upon the initial implementation of fin no 
 the company recorded a reduction of its january  retained earnings of million  which is comprised of million of tax and accrued interest of million million  net of tax 
as the determination of fin no 
liabilities and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company  there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits  and thus  the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company s net income or financial condition 
other estimates in addition  there are other accounting estimates within moody s consolidated financial statements  including recoverability of deferred tax assets  anticipated dividend distributions from non us subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody s 
operating segments beginning in january  moody s segments were changed to reflect the implementation of the business reorganization announced in august as a result of the reorganization  the rating agency remains in the moody s investors service operating company and several ratings business lines have been realigned 
all of moody s other commercial activities  including mkmv and sales of mis research  are now combined under a new operating company known as moody s analytics 
see reorganization and new segments section below 
in and prior years  moody s operated in two reportable segments moody s investors service and mkmv 
moody s investors service consisted of i four rating groups structured finance  corporate finance  financial institutions and sovereign risk  and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings to issuers and issues of fixed income obligations in the debt markets  and ii research  which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit information research  data and other analytical tools that are produced principally by the rating groups 
for presentation purposes  europe represents europe  the middle east and africa and public finance represents us public finance 
given the dominance of moody s investors service to moody s overall results  the company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses  nor are such expenses allocated between the company s business segments 
accordingly  all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the moody s investors service segment and none have been allocated to the mkmv segment

all of moody s other commercial activities  including moody s kmv and sales of mis research  are now combined under a new operating company known as moody s analytics 
moody s new initiatives in fixed income pricing and valuations will also be captured within moody s analytics 
moody s outlook for is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors  including interest rates  corporate profitability and business investment spending  merger and acquisition activity  consumer spending  residential mortgage borrowing and refinancing activity  securitization levels and capital markets issuance 
there is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and  if actual conditions differ from these assumptions  moody s results for the year may differ from our current outlook 
for moody s overall  full year revenue is expected to decline in the low double digit percent range 
this decline assumes foreign currency translation in at current exchange rates 
the company anticipates a weak first half of with improvement in market liquidity and issuance conditions later in the year 
under this scenario  moody s first half performance is likely to reflect unusually weak market conditions  as well as challenging year on year comparisons against the first half of when the company delivered record performance 
the company expects the full year operating margin to decline to the mid to high forties percent range  due primarily to lower ratings revenue 
full year expenses are expected to decrease approximately  primarily due to the restructuring charge of million  as well as expense savings from the restructuring actions  partially offset by investments in the growth areas of our business

contingencies from time to time  moody s is involved in legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation that are incidental to the company s business  including claims based on ratings assigned by moody s 
moody s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business 
management periodically assesses the company s liabilities and contingencies based upon the latest information available 
moody s discloses material pending legal proceedings  other than routine litigation incidental to moody s business  material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities and other pending matters that it may determine to be appropriate 
for matters  except those related to income taxes  where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  the company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate 
when sufficient uncertainties exist  related to the outcome and or the amount or range of loss  management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant 
as additional information becomes available  the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 
for income tax matters  the company employs the prescribed methodology of fin no 
 implemented as of january  fin no 
requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained  based on its technical merits  as of the reporting date  assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 
moody s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and governmental authorities and is cooperating with those inquiries 
based on its review of the latest information available  and subject to the contingencies described below  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  although it is possible that the effect could be material to the company s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period 
legacy contingencies moody s continues to have exposure to certain potential liabilities assumed in connection with the distribution legacy contingencies 
the following description of the relationships among moody s  new d b and their predecessor entities is important in understanding the legacy contingencies that relate to tax matters legacy tax matters 
in november  the dun bradstreet corporation separated into three separate public companies the dun bradstreet corporation  acnielsen corporation and cognizant corporation cognizant 
in june  the dun bradstreet corporation separated into two separate public companies old d b and rh donnelley corporation 
during  cognizant separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated ims health and nielsen media research  inc nmr 
in september  old d b separated into two separate public companies new d b and moody s  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
old d b and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business  including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations 
these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 
old d b and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes  penalties and interest resulting from unfavorable irs rulings on certain tax matters  and certain other potential tax liabilities  all as described in such agreements 
further  in connection with the distribution and pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  new d b and moody s have agreed on the financial responsibility for any potential liabilities related to legacy tax matters 
settlement agreements were executed with the irs in regarding legacy tax matters for the years and as of december   the company continues to carry a liability of million with respect to these matters 
with respect to these settlement agreements  moody s and new d b believe that ims health and nmr did not pay their full share of the liability to the irs pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements among the parties 
moody s and new d b paid these amounts to the irs on their behalf  and have been unable to resolve this dispute with ims health and nmr 
as a result  moody s and new d b have commenced arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr to collect a total of approximately million owed by ims health and nmr with respect to the matter 
moody s and new d b may also commence an arbitration proceeding to collect a total of million owed by ims health and nmr with respect to the matter 
moody s cannot predict the outcome of these matters with any certainty 
amortization expense deductions and irs deficiency notices the notices this legacy tax matter  which was affected by developments in june as further described below  involves a partnership transaction which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of old d b since irs audits of old d b s and new d b s tax returns for the years through concluded in june without any disallowance of the amortization expense deductions  or any other adjustments to income related to this partnership transaction 
these audits did result in the irs issuing the notices for other tax issues for the years aggregating million in tax and penalties  plus statutory interest of approximately million  which will be apportioned among moody s  new d b  ims health and nmr pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements 
moody s share of this assessment is anticipated to be million including interest  net of tax 
in november  the irs assessed the tax and penalties and used a portion of the deposit discussed below to satisfy the assessment  together with interest 
the company believes it has meritorious grounds to challenge the irs s actions and is evaluating its alternatives for further actions to recover these amounts the absence of any tax deficiencies in the notices for the amortization expense deductions for the years through and in companion notices of deficiency issued to new d b for and  combined with the expiration of the statute of limitations for through  for issues not assessed  resulted in moody s recording an earnings benefit of million in its second quarter 
this is comprised of two components  as follows i a reversal of a tax liability of million related to the period from through the distribution date  reducing the provision for income taxes for the year ended december   and ii a reduction of accrued interest expense of million million  net of tax and an increase in other non operating income of million  relating to amounts due to new d b  for the year ended december  on the distribution date in  new d b paid moody s million for of certain anticipated future tax benefits of new d b through it is possible that irs audits of new d b for tax years after could result in income adjustments with respect to the amortization expense deductions of this partnership transaction 
in the event these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by new d b  or there is an audit adjustment  moody s would be required  pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  to repay to new d b an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits and its share of any tax liability that new d b incurs 
as of december   moody s liability with respect to this matter totaled million 
in march  new d b and moody s each deposited million with the irs in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the through tax years 
in july  new d b and moody s commenced procedures to recover approximately million of these deposits million for new d b and million for moody s  which represents the excess of the original deposits over the total of the deficiencies asserted in the notices and in companion statutory notices of deficiency issued to new d b for and as noted above  in november the irs used million of moody s portion of the deposit to satisfy an assessment and related interest 
additionally  in january the irs paid moody s million in connection with this matter 
at december   moody s has recorded liabilities for legacy tax matters totaling million 
this includes liabilities and accrued interest due to new d b arising from the distribution agreement 
it is possible that the ultimate liability for legacy tax matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the company  which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody s future reported results  financial position and cash flows
