the partner trial  which has two study arms  began enrollment during the second quarter of and will evaluate the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve valve in patients who are considered at high risk for conventional open heart valve surgery 
in the first study arm cohort a  patients will be randomized on a basis to either high risk surgery or the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve 
cohort a will have patients and is a non inferiority analysis 
in the second study arm cohort b  patients who are deemed non operable will be randomized to medical management or the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve 
cohort b will have patients and is a superiority analysis 
the company anticipates it will complete enrollment in cohort b by the end of and complete enrollment in cohort a by the end of the third quarter all of the sapien valves in the partner trial have been delivered transfemorally using the retroflex delivery system 
during the third quarter of  the company received approval to begin selling the sapien valve in europe with the retroflex i and retroflex ii transfemoral delivery systems 
initially  the company plans to sell the sapien valve in europe with the retroflex i  and will phase in the retroflex ii during the first half of the retroflex ii  first used in canada in the first quarter of  further enhances the ease of use benefits of retroflex i by adding a customized atraumatic tip to enable clinicians to more easily navigate across the native stenotic aortic valve 
the company has received regulatory approval to add retroflex ii to the united states partner trial 
both the ascendra transapical and transfemoral delivery systems are available for sale in europe 
the company completed enrollment in its united states feasibility study of the ascendra transapical delivery system in april in january  the company obtained fda approval to add ascendra to the partner trial 
having ascendra in the trial will give cardiac surgeons an opportunity to partner in this technology and it will allow the company to address more patients 
in the company s transcatheter mitral valve repair program  the company had two systems the edwards monarc mitral repair system formerly ev  inc s ev percutaneous mitral valve repair program  a coronary sinus technology  and the edwards mobius leaflet repair system

investment impairments in september  the company recorded an million charge related to the other than temporary impairment of its investment in sangamo 
the investment was written down to million  which represented the quoted market price of sangamo s common stock at september  the company considered numerous facts  including those described below  to conclude that any impairment of the sangamo investment was temporary in nature as of the end of each of the quarters in and  and the first two quarters of sangamo s key internally established development milestones were progressing and or remained on track at each quarter end throughout and  and the first two quarters of there were no changes in technology that could impair sangamo s earnings potential of the investment and the technological progress supported a positive outlook 
the company believed that the number and scope of sangamo s programs and the range of its third party collaborations and the continued success in the company s sangamo related programs would significantly drive the value of sangamo 
moreover  the clinical momentum was building at the end of with the anticipation of three to four phase i human trials  the likely completion of one or more phase i trials with positive data and the planned announcements at major medical meetings 
management of the company believed that declines in sangamo s stock price were a result of certain external events and general investor sentiment of the biotechnology sector  and not sangamo specific activities 
in addition  the company recognized that  historically  reports of significant positive clinical outcomes had frequently resulted in a significant increase in the stock price of a biotechnology company over a relatively short time period 
management believed this would be the case for sangamo 
throughout all periods in which the company concluded that the impairment of this investment was temporary  sangamo maintained cash and liquid investment reserves sufficient to continue to fund the ongoing development efforts for the technology for periods well in excess of one year 
throughout all periods in which the company concluded that the impairment of this investment was temporary  the company had the financial ability and intent to retain this investment indefinitely 
sangamo s technology was considered important to the development of certain of the company s next generation products  and required a long term horizon for ongoing development of new technology 
sangamo is a multi technology human therapeutics  drug discovery and plant agriculture biotechnology company and has the ability to attract many different investors 
in addition  the diversity of technology applications served to dilute the risk related to any one application failure 
the company expected the market price of sangamo s stock to increase not only as a result of announcements of positive clinical trial results  but also other operational events 
during the second half of  sangamo announced five significant key developments regarding collaborative agreements  additional funding and breakthrough technology 
the company expected that this concentration of positive developments could have generated a considerable increase in the stock price  better recognizing the underlying value of sangamo 
based upon the significant developments in the third quarter of which  individually and in the aggregate  failed to have a material impact on the quoted market price of sangamo s stock  the continuing duration and severity of the impairment  and sangamo s declining cash position  the company concluded in september that the impairment on its investment in sangamo was other than temporary and  therefore  recognized an million charge in earnings 
in  the company recorded additional charges totaling million related to other than temporary impairment of technology investments in five other unconsolidated affiliates 
of the total additional charge  million related to declines in the stock prices of two available for sale investments 
the remaining charges were due to increased potential risk of certain private investees uncertain future liquidity 
charitable fund contribution in september  the company made a contribution of million to the edwards lifesciences fund  a donor advised fund intended to provide philanthropic support to cardiovascular disease charitable causes 
the contribution was an irrevocable contribution to a third party and was recorded as a charge at time of payment 
interest expense the million decrease in interest expense for resulted primarily from a lower average debt balance as compared to the prior year 
the million decrease in interest expense for resulted primarily from lower average interest rates  which resulted from the expiration of the company s fixed interest rate swap contracts in the third quarter of  combined with a greater portion of debt in low interest rate countries 
interest income the million decrease in interest income for resulted from slightly lower average interest rates 
the million increase in interest income for resulted from higher interest rates and a higher cash and cash equivalent balance

anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable 
the total accrued benefit liability for the company s pension plans recognized as of december  was million 
this amount is impacted by  among other items  pension expense funding levels  changes in plan demographics and assumptions  and investment return on plan assets 
because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs  we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
b contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that the company is obligated to pay upon achievement of product development and other milestones

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the company s accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in evaluating the company s transactions  management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 
management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies 
management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates 
as it relates to the company  estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves  rebate reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  workers compensation liabilities  employee benefit related liabilities  income taxes  any impairments of assets  forecasted transactions to be hedged  litigation reserves and contingencies 
these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain  and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements  using historical experience and all available information 
the company also uses outside experts where appropriate 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the company s reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product  provided that an agreement of sale exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
in the case of certain products where the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations  revenue is recognized at the time the company is notified that the customer has used the inventory 
the company s sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry  with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer  limited right of return  and no unusual provisions or conditions 
when the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products  an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable 
these adjustments include estimates for rebates  returns  and other sales allowances 
these provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience  historical relationship to revenues  estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers 
if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity  the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 
the company s estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that are based on third party data  as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates  and reflect other limitations 
the company s primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the company s united states distributors and represents the difference between the company s sales price to the distributor at the company s distributor list price and the negotiated price to be paid by the end customer 
this distributor rebate is recorded by the company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor s accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor 
the company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through a review of the inventory reports obtained from our largest distributors 
this customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates 
the company continually monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the liability for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 
the company also offers volume rebates to certain group purchasing organizations gpo and customers based upon target sales levels 
these volume rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the gpo 
the provision for volume rebates is estimated based on our customers contracted rebate programs and our historical experience of rebates paid 
the company continually monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated 
product returns are minimal because returns are not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt 
an allowance for return of damaged products is established based on historical experience and recorded as a reduction of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated or for customer specific circumstances  such as financial difficulty 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory the company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions 
additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated 
inventory reserves result from inventory which is obsolete  nearing its expiration date generally triggered at six months prior to expiration  or damaged or slow moving defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
patent costs the company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications 
the company capitalizes legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents for which success is deemed probable 
such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability 
to the extent the company is successful in its defense and enforcement of its patents and receives compensation for past infringement  costs capitalized in connection with the specific defense or enforcement are expensed as an offset against any gain received 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in evaluating goodwill  the company completes the two step goodwill impairment test as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the market capitalization and a market revenue multiple 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
since the adoption of sfas and sfas  the company has not performed the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit has exceeded its respective carrying value 
additionally  in accordance with sfas and sfas  management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
investments in unconsolidated affiliates investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long term  strategic equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development 
certain of these investments are designated as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these investments are carried at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method 
other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting  as appropriate 
the company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations  whereby the company owns a minimum of of the investee s outstanding voting stock  under the equity method of accounting 
these investments are recorded at the amount of the company s investment and adjusted each period for the company s share of the investee s income or loss and dividends paid 
as investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value  the company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investment s fair value 
when the fair value of a certain investment declines below cost  management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a realized loss the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  the reasons for the decline in market value  the investee s performance against product development milestones  and the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value

 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings

on january   the company adopted the provisions of fin differences between the amounts reported as a result of adoption have been accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the january  retained earnings balance 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin was a million decrease in tax reserves and increase in the january  retained earnings balance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets  including currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
edwards lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps  option based products and forward currency contracts 
the company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the total notional amounts of the company s derivative financial instruments at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements  option based products  and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the company s exposure through its use of derivatives 
interest rate risk the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
interest rate swap agreements are executed as an integral part of specific debt transactions or on a portfolio basis 
there were no interest rate swaps in effect as of december  as part of its overall risk management program  the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates 
a basis point increase in interest rates approximately of the company s weighted average interest rate affecting the company s financial instruments  including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments  would have an immaterial effect on the company s annual interest expense 
currency risk the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in japanese yen and the euro 
business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net united states dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
the company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts 
the company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated  but not yet committed  sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  the company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates 
such contracts hedge the united states dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets 
any changes in the carrying value of these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
as part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs  the company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option based products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations
