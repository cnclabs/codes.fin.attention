item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected historical consolidated financial data and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition  discovery and production of oil and natural gas in the united states 
we own interests in   net to us producing oil and natural gas wells and we operate  of these wells 
we own a controlling interest in bois d arc energy  an independent exploration company that owns interests in offshore producing oil and natural gas wells in the gulf of mexico 
the results of bois d arc energy have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning january  in managing our business  we are concerned primarily with maximizing return on our stockholders equity 
to accomplish this goal  we focus on profitably increasing our oil and natural gas reserves and production 
our future growth will be driven primarily by acquisition  development and exploration activities 
under our current drilling budget  we plan to spend approximately million in for development and exploration activities 
we plan to drill approximately development wells  net to us  and exploratory wells  net to us in however  the number of wells that we drill in will be subject to the availability of drilling rigs that we can hire 
in addition  we could increase or decrease the wells that we drill depending on oil and natural gas prices 
we do not budget for acquisitions as the timing and size of acquisitions are not predictable 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting which allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration activities 
accordingly  our exploration costs consist of costs we incur to acquire and reprocess d seismic data  impairments of our unevaluated leasehold where we were not successful in discovering reserves and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells that we drill 

table of contents we generally sell our oil and natural gas at current market prices at the point our wells connect to third party purchaser pipelines 
we market our products several different ways depending upon a number of factors  including the availability of purchasers for the product  the availability and cost of pipelines near our wells  market prices  pipeline constraints and operational flexibility 
accordingly  our revenues are heavily dependent upon the prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
our operating costs are generally comprised of several components  including costs of field personnel  insurance  repair and maintenance costs  production supplies  fuel used in operations  transportation costs  workover expenses and state production and ad valorem taxes 
like all oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  we face the challenge of replacing our reserves 
although in the past we have offset the effect of declining production rates from existing properties through successful acquisition and drilling efforts  there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset production declines or maintain production at rates through future acquisitions or drilling activity 
our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add new reserves in excess of production 
our operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and transportation of  oil and natural gas  and operating safety 
future laws or regulations  any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
applicable environmental regulations require us to remove our equipment after production has ceased  to plug and abandon our wells and to remediate any environmental damage our operations may have caused 
the present value of the estimated future costs to plug and abandon our oil and gas wells and to dismantle and remove our production facilities is included in our reserve for future abandonment costs  which was million as of december  investment in bois d arc energy bois d arc energy was organized in july as a limited liability company through the contribution of substantially all of our offshore properties together with the properties of bois d arc resources  ltd 
and its partners 
we initially owned of bois d arc energy  and we accounted for our share of bois d arc energy s financial and operating results using proportionate consolidation accounting until bois d arc energy was converted into a corporation and completed its initial public offering in may subsequent to the conversion into a corporation and as a result of the public offering  we owned of the outstanding shares of bois d arc energy 
since proportionate consolidation is not a generally accepted accounting principle applicable to an investment in a corporation  we changed our accounting method for our investment in bois d arc energy to the equity method concurrent with bois d arc energy s conversion to a corporation 
the offshore results for include our proportionate interest in the operations of bois d arc energy based upon our ownership interest throughout the period presented 
the equity method adjustments reflect the reductions to our share of bois d arc energy s operating results that are necessary to apply the equity method of accounting for all periods subsequent to the conversion of bois d arc energy to corporation 
during  we acquired additional shares of common stock of bois d arc energy  which increased our direct ownership interest in bois d arc energy 
as a result  we obtained voting control of bois d arc energy through our direct share ownership combined with the share ownership of members of our board of directors 
the results of bois d arc energy are included in our financial statements as a consolidated subsidiary  and as permitted by generally accepted accounting principles  consolidated revenues  expenses and cash flows for reflect bois d arc energy as a consolidated subsidiary as of january  financial statements for dates and periods prior to january   have not been adjusted 
although the 
table of contents inclusion of bois d arc energy as a consolidated subsidiary had no impact on our net income  comparisons of the separate components of our results of operations are significantly impacted by this change 
in order to provide more meaningful information regarding comparisons of our results for the year ended december   our discussion of our operating results and capital expenditures is presented based upon a comparison of actual results to pro forma results for adjusted to include bois d arc energy as a consolidated subsidiary 
the onshore data in the tables below contains the results of operations for our direct ownership in our onshore oil and gas properties

impairment 
we recorded impairments to our oil and gas properties of million in and million in the impairments in relate to minor valued fields where an impairment was indicated based on estimated future cash flows attributable to the fields estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
impairments in included million related to a property that was held for resale 
subsequently the plan to sell the property was cancelled 
the impairment in reflected this property s estimated fair market value at the time the plan to sell the property changed 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  which are reported net of overhead reimbursements  of million for were higher than general and administrative expenses of million for the increase primarily reflects higher personnel costs resulting from increased hiring to support our operating activities and an increase of million in stock based compensation in as compared to  including million in costs for accelerated vesting for bois d arc energy s former chief executive officer  who retired in november interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher outstanding borrowings and an increase in interest rates

oil and gas sales 
our oil and gas sales increased million in to million from pro forma consolidated sales of million in this increase primarily reflects a increase in production and higher prices for crude oil which were partially offset by lower natural gas prices in prices for crude oil increased by in as compared to our prices for crude oil in our average natural gas price decreased by in as compared to our average gas price in the higher production was primarily due to new wells drilled and the restoration of certain of our offshore production with the return to service of pipelines and facilities in after being shut in due to hurricanes in oil 
table of contents and gas sales from our onshore operations decreased to million  a decrease of million or  from sales of million in this decrease is attributable to the lower natural gas prices we realized in as compared to  which was partially offset by an increase in production 
the increase in production was mainly due to production from the properties we acquired in our average onshore crude oil price increased by and our average onshore natural gas price decreased by in as compared to prices in sales from our offshore operations of million in were higher than offshore revenues in of million mainly due to the increase in production resulting from the restoration of pipelines and facilities offshore and production from new wells that we drilled 
our average offshore crude oil price realized increased and our average offshore natural gas price realized decreased by in as compared to prices in oil and gas operating expenses 
our oil and gas operating expenses  including production taxes  increased million to million in from pro forma consolidated operating expenses of million in oil and gas operating expenses per equivalent mcf produced increased to as compared to in onshore operating expenses for of million increased by million compared to due to costs associated with the properties we acquired in or drilled in offshore oil and gas operating costs for increased million to million mainly due to our increase in production during as compared to production in our average offshore operating cost per mcfe produced increased in as compared to due to our higher produced volumes and increased cost of services and materials for fuel  services and supplies  and higher insurance costs 
exploration expense 
in  we incurred million in exploration expense as compared to pro forma consolidated exploration expense of million in exploration expense in primarily relates to dry hole expense for three offshore exploratory wells  two onshore exploratory wells  the acquisition and reprocessing of offshore d seismic data  and impairment of unproved properties 
pro forma exploration expense in includes million for a south texas dry hole  the cost of one offshore exploratory dry hole and offshore seismic costs 
dd a 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased million to million in from pro forma consolidated dda expense of million in our dd a rate per mcfe produced averaged in as compared to for dd a expense in for onshore operations increased million or from due to higher production and an increase in the onshore amortization rate caused by higher capitalized costs of the development wells we drilled 
offshore dd a expenses for increased million or from due to increased production and a higher the amortization rate 
the offshore amortization rate results from higher capitalized costs associated with the wells we drilled and the installation of new production facilities impairment 
we recorded impairments to our oil and gas properties of million in as compared to pro forma consolidated impairment expense of million in impairment of onshore properties of million increased in over primarily due to impairment in of a property that was held for resale 
subsequently the plan to sell the property was cancelled 
the impairment reflected this property s estimated fair market value at the time the plan to sell the property changed 
offshore impairments of million were related to several minor valued fields 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  which are reported net of overhead reimbursements  of million for were higher than pro forma consolidated general and administrative expenses of million for the increase primarily reflects higher personnel costs in due to increased staffing necessary to support the higher activity levels in our exploration and development programs  an increase of million in stock based compensation in as compared to  and the increased costs of compliance related to bois d arc energy which became a public company in may 
table of contents interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in from pro forma consolidated interest expense of million in the increase was primarily the result of higher borrowings and higher interest rates in average borrowings under our bank credit facilities increased to million in as compared to million for the average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities increased to in as compared to in derivative gains and losses 
we did not designate our derivatives we utilize as part of our price risk management program as cash flow hedges and accordingly  we recognize gains or losses for the changes in the fair value of these liabilities during each period 
the fair value of our liability for these derivatives decreased during resulting in a net unrealized gain of million 
during  the fair value of these liabilities increased due to the increase in natural gas prices and we accordingly recognized an unrealized loss of million during we realized losses to settle derivative positions of million and million during and  respectively 
minority interest 
minority interest in earnings of bois d arc energy of million for increased million from the pro forma minority interest in losses of million for primarily due to bois d arc energy s higher net income in this increase is mainly due to the absence of bois d arc energy s one time tax provision of million in associated with recognizing cumulative deferred tax liabilities when it converted from a limited liability company to a corporation 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased in to million from million in the tax provision included a million provision for deferred taxes related to bois d arc energy s conversion to a corporation during subsequent to bois d arc energy s conversion to a corporation  we are including a deferred tax provision on the change in our investment in bois d arc energy 
net income 
we reported net income of million in  as compared to net income of million in net income per share for was on million weighted average diluted shares outstanding as compared to for on million weighted average diluted shares outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources funding for our activities has historically been provided by our operating cash flow  debt or equity financings or asset dispositions 
in  our net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million 
our other primary source of funds in was net borrowings of million under our bank credit facilities 
in  our net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million 
our other primary source of funds in was a net increase of million under our bank credit facilities 
in  our net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million and we received proceeds of million from a public offering of our common stock 
in we also increased the debt outstanding under our bank credit facilities by million 
our cash flow from operating activities in increased by million to million as compared to million in primarily due to higher revenues which were attributable to our increased production and improved oil and natural gas prices 
our cash flow from operating activities in increased by million to million as compared to million in primarily due to higher revenues which were attributable to our increased production and the consolidation of bois d arc energy s cash flows 
our cash flow from operating activities in increased from pro forma cash flow from operating activities of million due to the higher oil and gas production in our primary need for capital  in addition to funding our ongoing operations  relate to the acquisition  development and exploration of our oil and gas properties  and the repayment of our debt 
our capital 
table of contents expenditures in of million increased by million over capital expenditures of million mostly due to acquisitions and increased drilling activity 
capital expenditures in of million increased by million over pro forma capital expenditures of million primarily due to increased drilling activity 
our annual capital expenditure activity is summarized in the following table year ended december  pro forma in thousands exploration and development acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties acquisitions of unproved oil and gas properties developmental leasehold costs development drilling exploratory drilling workovers and recompletions other development other total pro forma for consolidating the capital expenditures of bois d arc energy as of january  the timing of most of our capital expenditures is discretionary because we have no material long term capital expenditure commitments 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of our capital expenditures as circumstances warrant 
we currently expect to spend approximately million for development and exploration projects in  which will be funded primarily by cash flows from operating activities and to a lesser extent borrowings under our bank credit facilities 
our operating cash flow and therefore  our capital expenditures are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices  and in particular natural gas prices 
we spent million  million and million on acquisitions during  and  respectively 
our acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties in included the acquisition of certain oil and natural gas properties and related assets from swepi lp  an affiliate of shell oil company for million in december  and the acquisition of additional working interests in the javelina field in hidalgo county in south texas for million in june  these acquisitions were funded with borrowings under comstock s bank credit facility 
concurrent with the december acquisition  we entered into a transaction structured as a reverse like kind exchange in accordance with section of the internal revenue code 
while we intend to obtain tax deferred treatment on gains from future sales of oil and gas properties  no assurance can be given that we will have future transactions that will qualify as a like kind exchange or that we will achieve any tax savings as a result of this structure 
in connection with this reverse like kind exchange  we assigned the right to acquire ownership in the oil and gas properties that were acquired from swepi lp to an exchange accommodation titleholder 
we operate these properties pursuant to lease and management agreements 
because we are the primary beneficiary of these arrangements  the properties acquired are included in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   and we include all revenues earned and expenses incurred related to the properties in our results of operations during the term of the agreements 
these agreements will terminate upon the transfer of the acquired properties from the exchange accommodation titleholder to us no later than june  
table of contents we do not have a specific acquisition budget for since the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable 
smaller acquisitions will generally be funded from operating cash flow 
with respect to significant acquisitions  we intend to use borrowings under our bank credit facilities  or other debt or equity financings to the extent available  to finance such acquisitions 
the availability and attractiveness of these sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors  some of which will relate to our financial condition and performance and some of which will be beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates  oil and natural gas prices and other market conditions 
we have million of senior notes outstanding 
the senior notes are due march  and bear interest at  which is payable semiannually on each march and september the senior notes are unsecured obligations and are guaranteed by all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we have a million bank credit facility with bank of montreal  as the administrative agent 
the bank credit facility is a five year revolving credit commitment that matures on december  indebtedness under the bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our and our wholly owned subsidiaries assets and is guaranteed by all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the bank credit facility is subject to borrowing base availability  which is redetermined semiannually based on the banks estimates of the future net cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties 
as of december  the borrowing base was million  million of which was available 
the borrowing base may be affected by the performance of our properties and changes in oil and natural gas prices 
the determination of the borrowing base is at the sole discretion of the administrative agent and the bank group 
borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest  based on the utilization of the borrowing base  at our option at either libor plus to or the base rate which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus to 
a commitment fee of to  based on the utilization of the borrowing base  is payable on the unused portion of the borrowing base 
the bank credit facility contains covenants that  among other things  restrict the payment of cash dividends in excess of million  limit the amount of consolidated debt that we may incur and limit our ability to make certain loans and investments 
the only financial covenants are the maintenance of a ratio of current assets  including the availability under the bank credit facility  to current liabilities of at least one to one and maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  bois d arc energy has a million bank credit facility with the bank of nova scotia and several other banks 
borrowings under the bois d arc energy credit facility are limited to a borrowing base that is re determined semi annually based on the banks estimates of the future net cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties 
the borrowing base was million  million of which was available as of december  the determination of the borrowing base is at the sole discretion of the administrative agent and the bank group 
the bois d arc energy credit facility matures on may  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at bois d arc energy s option at either libor plus a margin that varies from to depending upon the ratio of the amounts outstanding to the borrowing base or the base rate which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus a margin that varies from to depending upon the ratio of the amounts outstanding to the borrowing base 
a commitment fee ranging from to depending upon the ratio of the amounts outstanding to the borrowing base is payable on the unused borrowing base 
indebtedness under the bois d arc energy credit facility is secured by substantially all of bois d arc energy s and its subsidiaries assets  and all of bois d arc energy s subsidiaries are guarantors of the indebtedness 
the bois d arc energy credit facility contains covenants that restrict the payment of cash dividends in excess of million  borrowings  sales of assets  loans to others  capital expenditures  investments  merger activity  hedging contracts  liens and certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders and requires bois d arc energy to maintain a ratio of current assets  including the availability under the bank credit facility  to current liabilities of at least one to one and a ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion  and 
table of contents amortization  exploration and impairment expense of no more than to one 
bois d arc energy was in compliance with these covenants as of december  we believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations and future growth as contemplated under our current business plan 
however  if our plans or assumptions change or if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to seek additional capital 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain such capital  or if such capital is available  that we will be able to obtain it on acceptable terms 
the following table summarizes our aggregate liabilities and commitments by year of maturity thereafter total in thousands bank credit facilities senior notes interest on debt operating leases acquisition of seismic data contracted drilling services future interest costs are based upon the interest rate on our outstanding senior notes and on the december  rate for our bank credit facilities 
we have obligations to incur future payments for dismantlement  abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties 
these payments are currently estimated to be incurred primarily after we record a separate liability for the fair value of these asset retirement obligations which totaled million as of december  federal taxation at december   we had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we have established a million valuation allowance against part of the net operating loss carryforwards that we acquired in an acquisition due to a change in control limitation which will prevent us from fully realizing these carryforwards 
the carryforwards expire from through the realization of these carryforwards depends on our ability to generate future taxable income in order to utilize these carryforwards 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and use assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues or expenses 
successful efforts accounting 
we are required to select among alternative acceptable accounting policies 
there are two generally acceptable methods for accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
the full cost method allows the capitalization of all costs associated with finding oil and natural gas reserves  including certain general and administrative expenses 
the successful efforts method allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration projects 
costs related to exploration that are not successful are expensed when it is determined that commercially productive oil and gas reserves were not found 
we have elected to use the successful efforts method to account for our oil and gas activities and we do not capitalize any of our general and administrative expenses 

table of contents oil and natural gas reserve quantities 
the determination of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense as well as impairments that are recognized on our oil and gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data  production history and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree imprecise  the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas prices may all differ materially from those assumed in these estimates 
the information regarding present value of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas reserves are estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
thus  such information includes revisions of certain reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year s estimates 
such revisions reflect additional information from subsequent activities  production history of the properties involved and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in product prices 
any future downward revisions could adversely affect our financial condition  our borrowing ability  our future prospects and the value of our common stock 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
we evaluate our properties on a field area basis for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the asset s carrying value to its undiscounted expected future net cash flows  then it is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
expected future cash flows are determined using estimated future prices based on market based forward prices applied to projected future production volumes 
the projected production volumes are based on the property s proved and risk adjusted probable oil and natural gas reserve estimates at the end of the period 
the oil and natural gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows because the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the period 
asset retirement obligations 
we have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and to restore land or seafloor at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
stock based compensation 
we follow the fair value based method prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r in accounting for equity based compensation 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight line basis over the award vesting period 
we adopted sfas r utilizing the modified prospective transition method and accordingly the financial results for periods prior to january  have not been adjusted 
prior to adopting sfas r we followed the fair value based method prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation for all periods beginning january  under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the award vesting period 
because we previously recorded stock based compensation using the fair value method  adoption of sfas r did not have a significant impact on our net income or earnings per share for the year ended december  
table of contents new accounting standards 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and we adopted fin at the beginning of fiscal the impact of adoption was not material 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

this statement establishes a framework for fair value measurements in the financial statements by providing a single definition of fair value  provides guidance on the methods used to estimate fair value and increases disclosures about estimates of fair value 
sfas will be effective for financial assets and liabilities in financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and will be effective for non financial assets and liabilities in financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this statement on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb concurrently issued sfas no 
r  business combinations and sfas no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 

both of these standards require measurements based on fair value as determined under the provisions of sfas and are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  in addition  both of these standards also include expanded disclosure requirements 
sfas r establishes accounting and reporting standards for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
this statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r will impact the accounting and disclosures for any business combinations we engage in after january  however  the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after that date 
sfas amends accounting research bulletin to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
it requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
it also requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated statement of income  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest 
this statement establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation 
sfas clarifies that all such transactions are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest in the subsidiary 
if there is a loss of control of the subsidiary  sfas requires the retained interest to be recorded at fair value 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this statement on our consolidated financial statements which is expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements due to our ownership of bois d arc energy 
related party transactions in recent years  we have not entered into any material transactions with our officers or directors apart from the compensation they are provided for their services 
we also have not entered into any business 
table of contents transactions with our significant stockholders or any other related parties except for the purchase of  shares of bois d arc energy s common stock for million in august item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s oil and natural gas prices our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
factors influencing oil and natural gas prices include the level of global demand for crude oil  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions which determine the demand for natural gas  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall economic conditions 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in our oil and natural gas reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can have an adverse affect on our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and natural gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on our oil and natural gas production in  a change in the price per barrel of oil would have resulted in a change in our cash flow for such period by approximately million and a change in the price per mcf of natural gas would have changed our cash flow by approximately million 
we periodically use derivative transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to mitigate our exposure to price changes 
while the use of these derivative arrangements limits the downside risk of price declines  such use may also limit any benefits which may be derived from price increases 
we use swaps  floors and collars to hedge oil and natural gas prices 
swaps are settled monthly based on differences between the prices specified in the instruments and the settlement prices of futures contracts quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
generally  when the applicable settlement price is less than the price specified in the contract  we receive a settlement from the counterparty based on the difference multiplied by the volume hedged 
similarly  when the applicable settlement price exceeds the price specified in the contract  we pay the counterparty based on the difference 
we generally receive a settlement from the counterparty for floors when the applicable settlement price is less than the price specified in the contract  which is based on the difference multiplied by the volumes hedged 
for collars  we generally receive a settlement from the counterparty when the settlement price is below the floor and pay a settlement to the counterparty when the settlement price exceeds the cap 
no settlement occurs when the settlement price falls between the floor and the cap 
we had no derivative financial instrument outstanding as of december  in january  we entered into a natural gas price hedge for certain of our natural gas properties in south texas 
the hedge was structured as a natural gas price swap which fixed the price at per mmbtu for delivery at the houston ship channel of  mmbtus of natural gas per month for the period february to december interest rates at december   we had long term debt of million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the fair market value of the fixed rate debt as of december  was million based on the market price of of the face amount 
at december   we had million outstanding under our bank credit facilities  which were subject to floating market rates of 
table of contents interest 
borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is tied to libor or the corporate base rate  at our option 
any increases in these interest rates can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
based on borrowings outstanding at december   a basis point change in interest rates would change our annual interest expense on our variable rate debt by approximately million 
we had no interest rate derivatives outstanding during or at december
