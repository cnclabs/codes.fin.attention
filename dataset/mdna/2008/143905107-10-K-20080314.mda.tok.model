item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate two types of businesses funeral homes  which account for approximately of our revenues  and cemeteries  which account for approximately of our revenues 
funeral homes are principally a service business that provide funeral services burial and cremation and sell related merchandise  such as caskets and urns 
cemeteries are primarily a sales business that sells interment rights grave sites and mausoleums and related merchandise such as markers and memorials 
as of december   we operated funeral homes in states and cemeteries in states within the united states 
substantially all administrative activities are conducted in our home office in houston  texas 
factors affecting our funeral operating results include demographic trends in terms of population growth and average age  which impact death rates and number of deaths  establishing and maintaining leading market share positions  effectively responding to increasing cremation trends by packaging complementary services and merchandise  controlling salary and merchandise costs  and exercising pricing leverage related to our at need business to increase average revenues per contract 
in simple terms  volume and price are the two variables that affect funeral revenues 
the average revenue per contract is influenced by the mix of traditional and cremation services because our average cremation service revenue is approximately of the average revenue earned from a traditional burial service 
funeral homes have a relatively fixed cost structure 
thus small changes in revenues  up or down  normally cause significant changes to our profitability 
the cemetery operating results are affected by the size and success of our sales organization because more than one half of our cemetery revenues for the year ended december  relate to sales of grave sites and mausoleums and related merchandise and services before the time of need  which we refer to as preneed 
we believe that changes in the level of consumer confidence a measure of whether consumers will spend for discretionary items also affect the amount of cemetery revenues 
approximately of our cemetery revenues for the year ended december  are attributable to investment earnings on trust funds and finance charges on installment contracts 
changes in the capital markets and interest rates affect this component of our cemetery revenues 
we have implemented several significant long term initiatives in our operations designed to improve operating and financial results by growing market share and increasing profitability 
we introduced a more decentralized  entrepreneurial and local operating model that included operating and financial standards developed from our best operations  along with an incentive compensation plan to reward business managers for successfully meeting or exceeding the standards 
the model essentially eliminated the use of financial budgets in favor of the standards 
the operating model and standards  which we refer to as being the best  focus on the key drivers of a successful operation  organized around three primary areas market share  people and operating and financial metrics 
the model and standards are the measures by which we judge the success of each business 
to date  the being the best operating model and standards have driven significant changes in our organization  leadership and operating practices 
in certain businesses we have determined that the business managers do not possess the characteristics to succeed in this type of culture  and we have been actively recruiting new managers who do 
being the best is not something that occurs easily and quickly  but we believe execution of the model produced improved results in should result in improving sustainable earnings in and beyond 
acquisitions our growth strategy includes the execution of the strategic portfolio optimization model 
the goal of that model is to build concentrated groups of businesses in ten to fifteen strategic markets 
we assess acquisition candidates using six strategic ranking criteria and to differentiate the price we are willing to pay 
those criteria are size of business size of market competitive standing demographics strength of brand barriers to entry 
table of contents in general terms  our price expectations range from four to five times pre tax earnings before depreciation for tuck ins to six to seven times pre tax earnings before depreciation for businesses that rank very high in the ranking criteria 
our expectation at the beginning of the year was to acquire two to three businesses a year 
during we completed seven acquisitions 
while the number of completed acquisitions was greater than expected  we continue to plan for two to three each year in the future

on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  realization of accounts receivable  inventories  intangible assets  property and equipment and deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  third party data and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these considerations form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying value of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  because there can be no assurance the margins  operating income and net earnings as a percentage of revenues will be consistent from year to year 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements presented herewith  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
funeral and cemetery operations we record the sales of funeral and cemetery merchandise and services when the merchandise is delivered or service is performed 
sales of cemetery interment rights are recorded as revenue in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
this method generally provides for the recognition of revenue in the period in which the customer s cumulative payments exceed of the contract price related to the real estate 
costs related to the sales of interment rights  which include property and other costs related to cemetery development activities  are charged to operations using the specific identification method in the period in which the sale of the interment right is recognized as revenue 
revenues to be recognized from the delivery of merchandise and performance of services related to preneed contracts that were acquired in acquisitions are typically lower than those originated by us 
allowances for bad debts and customer cancellations refunds are provided at the date that sale is recognized as revenue 
in addition  we monitor changes in delinquency rates and provide additional bad debt and cancellation reserves when warranted 
when preneed funeral services and merchandise are funded through third party insurance policies  we earn a commission on the sale of the policies 
insurance commissions are recognized as revenues when the commission is no longer subject to refund  which is usually one year after the policy is issued 
preneed selling costs consist of sales commissions and other direct related costs of originating preneed sales contracts 
prior to  these costs were deferred and amortized into funeral and cemetery costs and expenses over the period we expect to perform the services or deliver the merchandise covered by the preneed contracts 
the periods over which the costs were recognized were based on actuarial statistics for the actual contracts we hold  provided by a third party 
table of contents administrator 
beginning in  we changed our method of accounting for preneed selling costs 
preneed selling costs are now expensed as incurred 
the cumulative impact of the change was a charge in in the amount of million  net of tax  equal to per diluted share 
goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired  as determined by management in transactions accounted for as purchases  is recorded as goodwill 
many of the acquired funeral homes have provided high quality service to families for generations 
the resulting reputation often represents a substantial portion of the value of a funeral business 
goodwill is typically not associated with or recorded for the cemetery businesses 
in accordance with fas no 
 we review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually on reporting units aggregated geographically to determine if facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that this intangible asset might be carried in excess of fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the businesses in each reporting unit at our weighted average cost of capital less debt allocable to the reporting unit and by reference to recent sales transactions of similar businesses 
the calculation of fair value can vary dramatically with changes in estimates of the number of future services performed  inflation in costs  and our cost of capital  which is impacted by long term interest rates 
if impairment is indicated  then an adjustment will be made to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to fair value 
income taxes we and our subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return and separate income tax returns in the states in which we operate 
we record deferred taxes for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain 
management reviews the valuation allowance at the end of each quarter and makes adjustments if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
in june  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized  measured  and derecognized in financial statements  requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters  specifies how reserves for uncertain tax position should be classified on the balance sheet  and provides transition and interim period guidance  among other provisions 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and was adopted by the company as of january  we have reviewed our income tax positions and identified certain tax deductions  primarily related to business acquisitions that are not certain 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin has been recorded as a reduction to the opening balance of retained earnings and an increase in noncurrent liabilities in the amount of million which includes accrued interest and penalties totaling million 
our policy with respect to potential penalties and interest is to record them as other expense and interest expense  respectively 
stock compensation plans we have stock based employee compensation plans in the form of restricted stock  stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we account for stock based compensation under fas no

fas no 
r requires companies to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payment issued to employees over the period of vesting and applies to all transactions involving issuance of equity by a company in exchange for goods and services  including employee services

table of contents preneed funeral and cemetery trust funds we apply fasb interpretation no 
 as revised  fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
which clarifies the circumstances in which certain entities that do not have equity investors with a controlling financial interest must be consolidated by its sponsor 
our preneed and perpetual care trust funds are consolidated for financial reporting purposes  investments of such trust funds have been reported at market value and our future obligations to deliver merchandise and services have been reported at estimated settlement amounts 
we have also recognized the non controlling financial interests of third parties in the trust funds 
although fin r requires consolidation of preneed and perpetual care trusts  it did not change the legal relationships among the trusts  the company and its customers 
in the case of preneed trusts  the customers are the principal beneficiaries 
in the case of perpetual care trusts  we do not have a right to access the corpus in the perpetual care trusts 
for these reasons  we have recognized non controlling interests in our financial statements to reflect third party interests in these consolidated trust funds 
both the preneed trusts and the cemetery perpetual care trusts hold investments in marketable securities which have been classified as available for sale 
the investments are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses allocated to non controlling interests in trust investment in our consolidated balance sheet 
unrealized gains and losses attributable to the company  but that have not been earned through the performance of services or delivery of merchandise  are allocated to deferred revenues 
also  in connection with the application of fin r  we recognize the income  gains and losses of the preneed trusts and the unrealized income  gains and losses of the cemetery perpetual care trusts 
we recognize a corresponding expense equal to the recognized earnings of these trusts attributable to the non controlling interest holders 
when such earnings attributable to the company have not been earned through the performance of services or delivery of merchandise  we will record such earnings as deferred revenue 
for preneed trusts  we recognize as revenues amounts attributed to the non controlling interest holders and the company  including accumulated earnings  when the contracted services have been performed and merchandise delivered 
for cemetery perpetual care trusts  we recognize investment earnings in cemetery revenues when such earnings are realized and distributable 
such earnings are intended to defray cemetery maintenance costs incurred by us 
business combinations we apply the principles provided in fas no 
when we acquire businesses 
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value and goodwill is recognized for any difference between the total cost of the acquisition and our fair value determination 
we customarily estimate our transaction costs at closing of the acquisition 
to the extent that information not available to us at the closing date subsequently becomes available during the allocation period  as defined in fas no 
 we may adjust goodwill  assets  or liabilities associated with the acquisition 
discontinued operations in accordance with our strategic portfolio optimization model  non strategic businesses are reviewed to determine whether the businesses should be sold and the proceeds redeployed elsewhere 
a marketing plan is then developed for those locations which are identified as held for sale 
when we receive a letter of intent and financing commitment from the buyer and the sale is expected to occur within one year  the location is no longer reported within our continuing operations 
the assets and liabilities associated with the held for sale location are reclassified on the balance sheet and the operating results  as well as impairments  are presented on a comparative basis in the discontinued operations section of the consolidated statements of operations  along with the income tax effect
