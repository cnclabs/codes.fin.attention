table of contents liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments as of december  recent developments in december  we acquired checkfree  a leader in electronic commerce services and products  including electronic bill payment and internet banking  for approximately billion in cash and sold credstar  a mortgage credit reporting unit 
in the first quarter of  we sold fiserv health to unitedhealthcare services  inc for million in cash  which amount includes initial adjustments for net working capital and certain indebtedness of fiserv health and its subsidiaries as of the closing  and we sold the majority of our fiserv investment support services business to td ameritrade online holdings  inc for million in cash at closing  plus the amount of acquired regulatory capital 
we also sold del mar database  a provider of loan broker management products  in the first quarter of the operations of fiserv health  fiserv iss and the two lending businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in connection with the sale of the portion of the fiserv iss business to td ameritrade online holdings  inc  we can earn contingent cash consideration of up to million based on the achievement of revenue targets over the twelve months subsequent to closing 
with respect to the second part of the fiserv iss transaction  robert beriault holdings  inc has agreed to acquire the remaining accounts and net capital of fiserv iss  including the investment administration services business which provides back office and custody services for individual retirement accounts  for approximately million in cash 
we will retain a minority interest in this business  however  our continuing involvement is not expected to be significant 
this portion of the fiserv iss disposition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of  and is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions 
our operations are classified into three business segments our financial institution services business segment  our insurance services business segment  and our checkfree business segment 
due to the planned disposition of fiserv iss  our previously reported investment support services business segment is included in our results of discontinued operations 
in the first quarter of  we expect that we will realign our business segments when our new reporting structure and checkfree integration plans are finalized 
critical accounting policies general our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transaction based fees 
revenue is recognized when the related services have been rendered 
revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are long term in nature  generally three to five years  and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions 
given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition  our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations 
additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values 
the estimates used to determine the fair value of long lived assets  such as intangible assets  can be complex and require a significant amount of judgment 
we use the information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists  when necessary  to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long lived assets 
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definite lived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires us to perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
first  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit s net assets  goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit  then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and any impairment charge 
additionally  we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions  which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of determined that the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not impaired 
given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances  an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge  which could be material to our financial statements 
other we do not participate in  nor have we created  any off balance sheet variable interest entities or other off balance sheet financing  other than operating leases 
in addition  we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates and managing our ratio of fixed to floating rate long term debt 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the anticipated adoption dates  which is incorporated herein by reference 
non gaap financial measure in this report  we refer to internal revenue growth percentage  which is a non gaap financial measure 
we use internal revenue growth percentage to monitor and evaluate our performance  and it is presented in this report because we believe that it allows investors to see the portion of our revenue growth that is attributed to acquired companies as compared to internal revenue growth 
this non gaap financial measure should not be considered to be a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap 
the method that we use to calculate internal revenue growth percentage is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 

table of contents internal revenue growth percentage is measured as the increase or decrease in total revenue for the current year less acquired revenue from acquisitions divided by total revenues from the prior year plus acquired revenue from acquisitions 
acquired revenue from acquisitions represents pre acquisition revenue of acquired companies  less dispositions  for the prior year 
acquired revenue from acquisitions was million million in the financial segment and million in the insurance segment and million million in the financial segment and million in the insurance segment in and  respectively 
internal revenue growth percentages exclude our recent acquisition of checkfree because only a partial month of checkfree revenue was recorded in december results of operations components of revenues and expenses the following summary describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income 
a description of our revenue recognition policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
processing and services processing and services revenues  which in represented approximately of our consolidated revenues  are primarily generated from account and transaction based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years 
revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been rendered 
processing and services revenues are most reflective of our core business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services

total revenues total revenues increased million  or  in compared to  and million  or  in compared to the internal revenue growth rate was in and in with the remaining growth resulting from acquisitions 
overall internal revenue growth is primarily derived from sales to new clients  cross sales to existing clients and increases in transaction volumes from existing clients 
the higher internal revenue growth rate in compared to was primarily due to an increase in pass through prescription revenue from new clients and increased volumes in our insurance segment s workers compensation businesses which had a positive impact of approximately two percentage points in processing and services revenues increased and in and  respectively  compared to the prior year periods 
these increases were driven by sales to new clients  cross sales to existing clients  increases in transaction volumes from existing clients and incremental revenue attributable to several acquisitions  including a partial month of processing and services revenues totaling million from the acquisition of checkfree on december  partially offsetting these increases in were a million decrease in flood claims processing revenues in our insurance segment and revenue decreases in our lending processing businesses due to lower processing volumes primarily resulting from a downturn in the mortgage markets in the united states 
partially offsetting the increases in were a million decrease in contract termination fees and the impact of the loss of two clients in contract termination fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
businesses in our financial segment generally enter into three to five year contracts with clients that contain early contract termination fees 
these fees can be generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary significantly from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term a client is acquired 

table of contents product revenues increased and in and  respectively  compared to the prior year periods 
these increases were primarily due to incremental revenue attributable to new clients and increased volumes in the insurance segment s workers compensation businesses  growth in card fulfillment and print services within our output solutions division  and an acquisition in the revenue growth in our workers compensation businesses was impacted significantly by the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenues and expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively

in addition  checkfree contributed operating income of million in the month of december 
these positive factors were partially offset by a million decrease in higher margin flood claims processing revenues in our insurance segment  charges totaling million primarily related to employee severance and facility shutdown expenses in our lending businesses  merger and integration costs of million related to our acquisition of checkfree  and a charge of million associated with the amendment of an employment agreement related to the creation of our wholly owned offshore captive operation

in addition  operating margins in both and were negatively impacted by revenue growth in our workers compensation businesses  which generate operating margins in the low to mid single digits 
the negative impact on operating margins due to the inclusion of prescription product costs in revenue and expense was approximately two percentage points in  and segment results our continuing operations are classified into three business segments our financial institution services business segment our financial segment  our insurance services business segment our insurance segment  and our checkfree business segment our checkfree segment 
the businesses that make up our financial segment provide account and transaction processing systems and services to financial institutions  such as banks  thrifts and credit unions  and other financial intermediaries 
the businesses that comprise our insurance segment provide a wide range of services to insurance carriers  agents and distributors 
the businesses that comprise our checkfree segment provide online banking  electronic billing and payment  software applications and investment management solutions to financial institutions and financial services organizations 
checkfree is presented as a separate segment because it was acquired on december  in the first quarter of  we expect that we will realign our business segments when our new reporting structure and checkfree integration plans are finalized 
the following table presents  for the years indicated  revenues  operating income  and operating margin for our business segments 
years ended december  dollars in millions financial insurance checkfree total total revenues revenue growth operating income operating income growth decline operating margin represents revenue or operating income growth decline compared to the prior year

see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment operating income to operating income reported on the consolidated statement of income 
we acquired checkfree on december  and  as a result  the results include days of checkfree operations and amortization expense from acquired intangible assets of million 

table of contents financial revenues in our financial segment increased million  or  in and million  or  in the internal revenue growth rate in the financial segment was and in and  respectively  with the remaining growth in each year resulting from acquisitions 
internal revenue growth in this segment was primarily driven by increased volumes and new clients in the electronic payments businesses along with new client growth and increased sales to existing clients in the banking and credit union core processing businesses and card fulfillment businesses 
in  internal revenue growth was negatively impacted by approximately one percentage point due to a decrease in revenues in our home equity loan processing businesses due primarily to a decline in volumes associated with weakness in the mortgage markets in the united states in the second half of in  internal revenue growth was negatively impacted by approximately one percentage point from a decrease in contract termination fees 
operating income in our financial segment increased million  or  in compared to and decreased million  or  in compared to operating margins were  and in  and  respectively 
operating margins in increased percentage points compared to primarily due to higher margin revenue growth in our core processing and electronic payments businesses and overall operating efficiencies in our bank and credit union core processing and payments businesses resulting primarily from the implementation of strategic initiatives that lowered costs

during this period  revenues totaled million and operating income and operating margin were million and  respectively 
included in total expenses for the checkfree segment was amortization expense from acquired intangible assets totaling million during the day period 

table of contents interest expense and interest income interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million increase in interest expense in was primarily due to the new senior term loan and senior notes borrowings in the fourth quarter of to finance our acquisition of checkfree 
because of these new borrowings  which had a combined principal balance of billion at december   we expect that interest expense will be significantly higher in as compared to the million increase in interest expense in was due primarily to higher interest rates and increased average borrowings outstanding in compared to interest income was million  and million in  and  respectively 
interest income in was earned by investing the proceeds from the senior notes borrowings during the period from our receipt of the proceeds until we completed the checkfree acquisition 
the interest income in was primarily due to increased cash balances resulting from the proceeds we received for the sale of our securities clearing businesses 
realized gain from sale of investments in  we realized a pre tax gain of million from the sale of million shares of common stock of bisys group  inc in addition  we sold our investment in intria items  inc to our joint venture partner  canadian imperial bank of commerce  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was in  in and in the effective income tax rates for and were favorably impacted  as compared to  primarily by changes in state tax laws  the finalization of various tax returns and a lower tax rate on the sale of investments 
we expect that our income tax rate for continuing operations will be approximately in income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  which includes fiserv health  fiserv iss  credstar  del mar database and our securities clearing businesses  totaled million in and million in and the decrease in income from discontinued operations in was primarily due to million of charges related to disposition activities including retention bonuses  employee severance and other sale related expenses and a million charge at fiserv health for employee severance  facility shutdown and other charges to cease an investment in a new technology platform in the health plan management business in the second quarter of net income per share diluted net income per share diluted for was compared to in and in net income per share diluted from continuing operations was in compared to in and in net income per share diluted from continuing operations in compared to was negatively impacted by approximately per share due to merger and integration costs and intangible amortization expense associated with our acquisition of checkfree and a per share increase in facility shutdown and related costs

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity needs are i to fund normal operating expenses  ii to meet debt service requirements of million in  including million of our senior notes maturing in april and june of and million of our senior term loan due in december of  and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments 
we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations and proceeds from dispositions during the next twelve months 
in the first quarter of  we received proceeds from the dispositions of fiserv health and fiserv iss totaling approximately million after taxes 
as of january   we had million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations  or operating cash flow  was million in compared with million in operating cash flow in compared to was negatively impacted by the payment of million to settle treasury lock interest rate hedge contracts entered into in connection with the financing of our acquisition of checkfree

share repurchases under this authorization are expected to be made through open market transactions as market conditions warrant 
shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans 
our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures and to repay debt  rather than to pay dividends 
on december   we acquired checkfree for billion  net of cash acquired 
to complete the acquisition  we borrowed billion under an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks  issued billion of senior notes and borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
in  and  we used million  million and million  respectively  to acquire other businesses 
revolving credit facility and commercial paper we maintain a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
the facility bears interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank s base rate 
there are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under this facility 
the revolving credit facility  as amended  contains various restrictions and covenants that require us  among other things  to limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than a specified multiple ranging between and of consolidated net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments and to maintain consolidated net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense 
the facility expires on march  in  we were in compliance with all debt covenants in this and our other credit facilities  including those contained in our senior unsecured notes 
we are authorized to issue up to million of unsecured commercial paper under our commercial paper program 
under this program  we may issue commercial paper with maturities of up to days from the date of issuance 
the revolving credit facility supports of any outstanding commercial paper 
as a result  borrowings under the commercial paper program reduce the amount of credit available under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   no commercial paper borrowings were outstanding under this program 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper program were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the weighted average variable interest rate on these borrowings was at december  
table of contents senior term loan in december  we borrowed billion under an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks 
this term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank s base rate  and matures in december scheduled principal payments of million are due in december and  payments of million are due in december and  and the remaining principal of billion is due in december the weighted average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was at december  the term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described above 
senior notes in november  we issued billion of senior notes due in november and million of senior notes due in november  which notes pay interest at the stated rate on may and november of each year 
in addition  we previously issued million of senior notes  which are due in april  and million of senior notes  which are due in june interest rate hedge contracts to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  we entered into a series of treasury lock agreements treasury locks in with total notional values of billion and maintain interest rate swap agreements swaps with total notional values of billion and million at december  and  respectively 
the swaps effectively fix interest rates on floating rate borrowings under the revolving credit facility and term loan at a weighted average rate of approximately  prior to financing spreads and related fees 
the swaps have original contract terms of two to five years with expiration dates through september upon the issuance of the senior notes in november  we paid million to settle the treasury locks 
this payment was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of income taxes of million  and will be recognized as interest expense over the terms of the senior notes 
in addition  we maintain fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements on the million senior notes  with a variable interest rate of at december  day revolving credit facility in november  we entered into a day revolving credit facility under which borrowings were conditioned upon our full draw of available borrowings under our million revolving credit facility described above and prepayments were required in the event of certain asset sales or other transactions 
no borrowings under the day revolving credit facility were outstanding at december  and we terminated this facility in february shelf registration statement in  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
under the registration statement  we may sell common stock  preferred stock and debt securities  or a combination thereof 
each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering 
we may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways through underwriters or dealers  through agents  directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods 
proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay indebtedness or for working capital  acquisitions or general corporate purposes 
as discussed above  in  we issued billion of senior unsecured notes under the shelf registration statement 

table of contents other access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital  our ability to refinance maturing indebtedness and our ability to fund future acquisitions 
our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on various factors  including general market conditions  interest rates  credit ratings on our debt securities  perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our capital stock 
as of december   we had a credit rating of baa with a stable outlook from moody s investors service  inc moody s and bbb with a negative outlook from standard poor s ratings services s p on our senior unsecured debt securities 
the interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if moody s or s p downgrades or subsequently upgrades the debt rating applicable to the senior notes 
if the ratings from moody s or s p decrease  the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 
in no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes or will the total increase in the per annum interest rate be more than above the original interest rate 
the interest rates on any series of senior notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes become rated a or its equivalent or higher by moody s and a or its equivalent or higher by s p  in each case with a stable or positive outlook 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on investments and borrowings 
we actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 
fiserv iss  which is included in discontinued operations  accepts retirement account deposits from clients and invests the funds in securities  substantially all of which are rated within the highest investment grade categories for securities 
fiserv iss utilizes simulation models for measuring and monitoring interest rate risk and market value of portfolio equities 
a formal asset and liability committee meets quarterly to review interest rate risks  capital ratios  liquidity levels  portfolio diversification  credit risk ratings and adherence to investment policies and guidelines 
we do not believe significant changes in interest rates would have a material impact on our operating results from discontinued operations or our financial condition 

table of contents we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt and through the use of interest rate hedge contracts 
we currently use interest rate swaps to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs 
generally  under these swaps  we agree with a counter party to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount 
based on our long term debt with variable interest rates as of december   a increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in by approximately million 
we believe the risks associated with financial instruments at december  will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
