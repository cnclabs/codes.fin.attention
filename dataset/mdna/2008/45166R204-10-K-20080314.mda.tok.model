overview idenix is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of human viral and other infectious diseases  with operations in the united states and europe 
our current focus is on diseases caused by hepatitis c virus  or hcv  and human immunodeficiency virus  or hiv 
prior to october   we developed  commercialized and manufactured telbivudine for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis b 
certain of these activities were done with novartis pharma ag  or novartis 
telbivudine is marketed as tyzeka in the united states and sebivo outside the united states 
in april  sebivo was approved in the european union for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis b 
at december   tyzeka sebivo was approved in more than countries world wide  including china 
in september  we entered into an amendment to the development and commercialization agreement  which we refer to as the amendment 
when we refer to the development and commercialization agreement  we mean the original agreement  amendment and all prior amendments 
we and novartis also entered into a transition services agreement  or a tsa  as part of the amendment 
pursuant to the amendment  we transferred to novartis our development  commercialization and manufacturing rights and obligations pertaining to telbivudine tyzeka sebivo on a worldwide basis 
effective october   we began receiving royalty payments equal to a percentage of net sales of tyzeka sebivo  with such percentage increasing according to specified tiers of net sales 
the royalty percentage varies based upon the territory and the aggregate dollar amount of net sales 
in conjunction with the amendment  we announced a restructuring of our operations in which we enacted a workforce reduction of approximately positions  the majority of which had supported the development and commercialization of tyzeka sebivo in the united states and europe 
the restructuring was a strategic decision on our behalf to focus our resources on our hcv and hiv discovery and development programs 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million in  including million for employee severance  benefits and related costs and million for the impairment of certain assets 
we also incurred additional charges in of million due to accelerating depreciation on certain assets whose useful lives were shortened due to the restructuring 
we estimate that this restructuring will result in annual cost savings of million to million  including associated third party and marketing costs 

table of contents the following table summarizes key information regarding tyzeka sebivo and our pipeline of product candidates indication product product candidates programs description hbv tyzeka sebivo telbivudine l nucleoside effective october   we transferred to novartis all of our development  commercialization and manufacturing rights and obligations related to telbivudine tyzeka sebivo on a worldwide basis in exchange for royalty payments equal to a percentage of net sales of tyzeka sebivo 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  novartis is solely responsible for clinical trial costs and related expenditures associated with telbivudine 
we have transitioned to novartis all ongoing clinical trials and commercial activities related to telbivudine 
valtorcitabine l nucleoside during the third quarter of  we discontinued development of valtorcitabine 
hcv valopicitabine nm nucleoside analog in july  this program was placed on clinical hold by the fda and development of the program was discontinued 
discovery program preclinical evaluation of compounds from the hcv discovery program is in progress 
this program is focused on the three primary classes of drugs for the treatment of hcv  which include nucleoside nucleotide polymerase inhibitors  protease inhibitors and non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors 
nucleoside nucleotide polymerase inhibitors idx and idx the most advanced of these efforts is our research in next generation nucleoside nucleotide polymerase inhibitors 
idx and idx are in late stage preclinical development 
we expect to submit an ind in the united states and a cta in europe for at least one of these product candidates in protease inhibitors we are evaluating multiple scaffolds in our protease inhibitor discovery program 
clinical candidates from this program have been selected and ind enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies are ongoing 
non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors we have an ongoing discovery effort in non nucleoside polymerase inhibitors 

table of contents indication product product candidates programs description hiv idx non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or nnrti in addition to our hcv discovery and development program  we are also engaged in efforts to develop therapeutics for the treatment of hiv from the class of compounds known as non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors  or nnrtis 
this class of drugs is being evaluated for once a day oral administration 
we filed an ind for idx in and completed a phase i dose escalation study in healthy volunteers 
the phase i study was designed to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of idx in healthy volunteers 
in this study  idx appeared to be well tolerated at single doses up to mg and multiple doses up to mg daily over a seven day period 
no serious or clinically significant adverse events were reported for the idx treated volunteers in this study 
one healthy volunteer  after the mg single dose administration of this study  experienced a single unconfirmed qtc elevation 
we believe this is not a significant clinical finding as it is within the expected variability of multiple qtc measurements in a healthy volunteer study 
two volunteers discontinued from the study due to adverse events 
in may  we entered into a collaboration with novartis relating to the worldwide development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the collaboration includes the development  license and commercialization agreement  as amended and the master manufacturing and supply agreement between us and novartis 
under the collaboration  novartis paid us a license fee of million for our hbv product and product candidate  tyzeka sebivo and valtorcitabine  respectively  provided development funding for tyzeka sebivo and valtorcitabine and was obligated to make milestone payments  which could have totaled up to million upon the achievement of specific regulatory approvals 
of the million in regulatory milestone payments  we received payment on two of these regulatory milestones in we achieved one of these regulatory milestones for million in the first quarter of with the regulatory approval of sebivo in china 
we recognized this regulatory milestone payment in collaboration revenue from novartis in as the milestone was deemed substantive 
a second of these regulatory milestones for million was achieved in april with the regulatory approval of sebivo in the european union 
this milestone was deemed not to be substantive and we recognized million as revenue in  representing the portion of the development period that has passed  with the remaining million recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the remaining development period of our licensed product candidates 
we do not expect to receive any additional regulatory milestones for telbivudine or valtorcitabine 
in march  novartis exercised its option to license valopicitabine  our lead hcv product candidate at that time 
under the development and commercialization agreement  novartis agreed to pay us up to million in license fees and regulatory milestone payments for an hcv product candidate 
of this amount and in connection with its option exercise  novartis paid us a license fee of million  paid us an additional million payment based upon results from our phase i clinical trial and provided development funding for the product candidate 
in july  we announced that the fda had placed on clinical hold in the united states our development program of valopicitabine for the treatment of hcv based on the overall risk benefit profile observed in clinical testing 
we 
table of contents subsequently discontinued the development of valopicitabine 
as a result  we do not expect to receive any additional license fees or milestone payments for valopicitabine from novartis 
we initially planned to co promote or co market with novartis in the united states  united kingdom  france  germany  italy and spain all products novartis licenses from us that are successfully developed and approved for commercial sales  including tyzeka sebivo 
effective october   we transferred to novartis our development  commercialization and manufacturing rights and obligations related to telbivudine tyzeka sebivo on a world wide basis in exchange for royalty payments equal to a percentage of net sales  with such percentage increasing according to specified tiers of net sales 
the royalty percentage will vary based upon the territory and the aggregate dollar amount of net sales 
we continue to have co promotion and co marketing rights with novartis in the united states  united kingdom  france  germany  italy and spain on all other products  with the exception of tyzeka sebivo  that novartis licenses from us that are successfully developed and approved for commercial sales 
novartis has the exclusive right to promote and market these licensed products in the rest of the world 
pursuant to the supply agreement  novartis was appointed to finish and package licensed products for commercial sale 
novartis was also afforded the opportunity to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for the commercial supply of licensed products if certain conditions and criteria were satisfied 
in june  after completing a competitive bid process where novartis had the right to match the best third party bid  we entered into a commercial manufacturing agreement with novartis and a packaging agreement with novartis pharmaceuticals corporation  an affiliate of novartis 
under the commercial manufacturing agreement  novartis would manufacture the commercial supply of tyzeka that was intended for sale in the united states 
the packaging agreement provided that the supply of tyzeka intended for commercial sale in the united states would be packaged by novartis pharmaceuticals corporation 
as a result of the amendment  the commercial manufacturing agreement and supply agreement were terminated as each related to telbivudine and we will work with novartis to terminate our rights and obligations to the packaging agreement 
effective october   novartis is solely responsible for the manufacture and supply of tyzeka sebivo on a worldwide basis 
no penalties were incurred by us as a result of the termination of these agreements 
in addition to the collaboration described above  novartis purchased approximately of our outstanding capital stock in may from our then existing stockholders for million in cash  with an additional aggregate amount of up to million contingently payable to these stockholders if we achieve predetermined development milestones relating to an hcv product candidate 
the future contingent payments are payable in cash or  under certain circumstances  novartis ag american depository shares 
at present  novartis owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
all of our product candidates are currently in preclinical development or clinical development 
to commercialize any of our product candidates  we will be required to obtain marketing authorization approvals after successfully completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of such product candidates 
currently  tyzeka sebivo has received regulatory approval for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis b in more than countries around the world  including the united states  china  switzerland and the european union 
we started recognizing revenue from product sales associated with tyzeka in the united states during the fourth quarter of to date  our revenues have been derived from license fees and milestone payments  development expense reimbursements received from novartis  tyzeka product sales in the united states prior to october   amounts associated with sebivo product sales outside of the united states prior to october   royalty payments associated with sales of tyzeka sebivo  and government grants 
effective october  with the recent transfer to novartis of our development and commercial rights to telbivudine  we no longer recognize revenue from product sales of tyzeka and instead we recognize royalty income associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo 
we derived substantially all of our total revenues from novartis in  and we anticipate recognizing additional revenues from our collaboration with novartis 
these revenues include additional development expense funding for our hcv product candidate and other product candidates that novartis may elect to subsequently license from us  as well as  regulatory milestones and  if products are approved for sale  commercialization milestones and revenues derived from sales by us or novartis of our licensed product candidates 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception in may and expect such losses to continue in the foreseeable future 
historically  we have generated losses principally from costs associated with research and 
table of contents development activities  including clinical trial costs  and general and administrative activities 
as a result of planned expenditures for future discovery and development activities  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we expect our near term sources of funding to consist principally of the reimbursement of expenses we may incur in connection with the development of our licensed product and product candidates  potential license and other fees we may receive in connection with license agreements with third parties  and anticipated royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and payroll related expenses for research and development personnel  including stock based compensation  fees paid to clinical research organizations and other professional service providers in conjunction with our clinical trials  fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with animal studies  costs of material used in research and development  costs of contract manufacturing consultants  occupancy costs associated with the use of our research facilities and equipment  consulting and license fees paid to third parties  and depreciation of property and equipment related to research and development 
we incur the majority of our research and development spending on clinical  preclinical and manufacturing activity with third party contractors relating to the development of our product candidates 
we expense internal and external research and development costs as incurred 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase from our base level as of january  as we continue to engage in research activities  further develop our potential product candidates and advance our clinical trials 
set forth below are the direct third party research and development expenses incurred during the period from may  through december   and the years ended december    and in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials of tyzeka sebivo  valtorcitabine and valopicitabine 
period from may  inception disease product product through years ended december  indication candidate december  total dollars in thousands hbv tyzeka sebivo     hbv valtorcitabine     hcv valopicitabine     we anticipate that we will incur significant additional direct third party research and development expenses prior to the commercial launch of our hcv product candidates 
we expect such amounts to approximate those set forth below estimated additional amount of direct third party research and development expenses expected to be incurred prior to current stage of commercial launch product candidate development of a drug idx and idx preclinical to million protease inhibitor program preclinical to million idx clinical to million our current estimates of additional direct or third party research and development expenses do not include the cost of phase iiib iv clinical trials and other clinical trials that are not required for regulatory approval 
we use our employees and our infrastructure resources across several projects  including our product discovery efforts 
we do not allocate our infrastructure costs on a project by project basis 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the internal costs incurred to date for our product candidates on a project by project basis 

table of contents pursuant to our development and commercialization agreement with novartis  after it licenses a product candidate  novartis is obligated to fund development expenses that we incur in accordance with development plans agreed upon by us and novartis 
the option we have granted to novartis with respect to its exclusive right to license our product candidates generally requires that novartis exercise the option for each such product candidate generally days after early demonstration of activity and safety in a proof of concept clinical study 
the expenses associated with phase iii clinical trials generally are the most costly component in the development of a successful new product 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues revenues for the years ended december  and were as follows years ended december  in thousands collaboration revenue related party reimbursement of research and development costs license fee revenue milestone revenue royalty revenue product revenue rest of world profit sharing to related party product sales  net government grants total revenues collaboration revenue related party consists of revenue associated with our collaboration with novartis for the worldwide development and commercialization of our product candidates 
effective october   as a result of the amendment  collaboration revenue related party is comprised of the following reimbursement by novartis for expenses we incur in connection with the development and registration of our licensed products and product candidates  net of certain qualifying costs incurred by novartis  license and other fees received from novartis for the license of hbv and hcv product candidates  net of reductions for novartis stock subscription rights  which is being recognized over the development period of the licensed product candidates  milestone amounts from novartis upon achievement of regulatory filings  certain marketing authorization approvals and other milestone payments  and royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo made by novartis 
prior to october   collaboration revenue related party that we have recognized from novartis also included the following product revenue rest of world which is comprised of amounts that novartis would pay us for the supply of licensed products in countries outside of the united states  united kingdom  germany  france  spain and italy 
these amounts were recorded as revenue at a percentage of net sales  and profit sharing to related party which represents the net benefit amount paid to novartis on licensed product sales in the united states in which we acted as the lead commercialization party 
the net benefit  defined as 
table of contents net sales less cost of goods sold  was shared equally with novartis on product sales in the united states 
these amounts due to novartis were recorded as a reduction of collaboration revenue 
collaboration revenue related party decreased million to million in reimbursements of research and development costs from novartis declined by million in as clinical studies and clinical trial activity came to a close in advance of the commercial launch of tyzeka sebivo in november and as a result of the discontinuation of our valtorcitabine and valopicitabine development activities in the lower research and development reimbursements were offset by i recognition of a million regulatory milestone payment received from novartis upon achievement of marketing authorization of sebivo in china in the first quarter of which was deemed substantive  ii increased license fee revenue due to recognition of million of revenue relating to a million milestone payment received upon achievement of regulatory approval of sebivo in the european union in april  offset by amounts relating to changes in the estimated development period  and iii million of royalty revenue primarily associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo made by novartis 
the increase in product sales of million in was due to increased market acceptance of tyzeka in the united states following its launch in november and to the inclusion of a nine month sales period in versus a two month sales period in as a result of the amendment of our agreement with novartis in september  effective october   we no longer record product sales as revenue 
cost of sales cost of sales were million in as compared with million in the increase of million is primarily related to million related to the non binding settlement proposal with uabrf and related entities 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in as compared with million in the decrease of million in was primarily due to a decrease in expenses for third party contractors  primarily related to clinical trials of tyzeka sebivo 
these expenses decreased due to the commercial launch of tyzeka sebivo in november and discontinuation of our development of valtorcitabine and valopicitabine in the decrease was partially offset by increases to expand other research and development activities  primarily an increase of salary and payroll related expenses associated with hiring additional employees and laboratory operating expenses 
while our operating expenses for will be considerably less than that for  we expect that operating expenses for and beyond may increase as we expand our drug discovery and development efforts 
we continue to devote substantial resources to our research and development activities  expand our research pipeline  engage in future development activities as we continue to advance our product candidates and explore collaborations with other entities that we believe will create shareholder value 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to an increase in professional fees  salary and other payroll related expenses related to the hiring of sales and marketing personnel in the united states in mid and in europe in early in connection with the commercialization of tyzeka sebivo  and accelerated depreciation of million related to enterprise software that was no longer needed with the transition of commercialization and development activities to novartis effective october  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease in due to the recent transfer to novartis of our commercialization rights to telbivudine and to the related restructuring 
restructuring and impairment charges as described above  as a result of the amendment  we announced a restructuring of our operations and enacted a workforce reduction of approximately positions  the majority of which had supported the development and commercialization of tyzeka sebivo in the united states and europe 
in connection with the 
table of contents restructuring  we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million in  including million for employee severance  benefits and related costs and million for the impairment of certain assets 
investment and other income  net net investment income was million in as compared with million in the decrease in resulted from lower average cash and marketable securities balances held in due to the use of cash for operations  and a result of lower average interest rates

income taxes the income tax expense was approximately million in as compared with a tax benefit of approximately million in during the fourth quarter of  we re assessed an uncertain tax position related to our international operations 
as a result  we recorded million of expense associated with this uncertain tax position including million associated with prior years which consisted of expense  interest and penalties 
of the total charge recorded  million was classified as investment and other income  net consistent with our policy for the classification of interest and penalties 
we determined that the amount related to prior years was not material to our results 
if our estimates related to this matter change  this amount may be adjusted accordingly in future periods

liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our operations with proceeds obtained in connection with license and development arrangements and equity financings 
the proceeds include license  milestone  royalty and other payments from novartis  reimbursements from novartis for costs we have incurred subsequent to may  in connection with the development of tyzeka sebivo  valtorcitabine and valopicitabine  net proceeds from sumitomo for reimbursement of development costs  collections on sales of tyzeka in the united states  net proceeds from private placements of our convertible preferred stock  net proceeds from public offerings and concurrent private placements of our common stock in july and in october and proceeds from the exercise of stock options granted pursuant to our equity compensation plans 
as a result of the clinical hold the fda placed on our development program of valopicitabine  we discontinued the development of valopicitabine 
therefore  we will not receive any additional license fees or other milestone payments for valopicitabine from novartis 
as a result of the transfer to novartis of our development and commercial rights to telbivudine in october  we will no longer recognize revenue from product sales of tyzeka sebivo 
during the third quarter of  we discontinued development of valtorcitabine 
as a result  we will not receive any future payments for valtorcitabine from novartis

bssc is a separately capitalized broker dealer subsidiary of bear  stearns and co 
inc  or bear stearns 
on march   bear stearns announced that it had received funding from outside parties  including the federal reserve bank of new york  for a limited period of time in order to manage an ongoing deterioration of its liquidity position 
we do not believe bear stearns liquidity position will affect our access to or the fair value of our cash and other investments held at bssc 
we held approximately million in municipal auction rate securities at december  our investments in auction rate securities consist solely of municipal debt securities and none of the auction rate securities in our portfolio are mortgage backed 
the auction rate securities we held at december  reset is subsequent auctions in january in mid february  certain of our municipal auction rate securities experienced failed auctions 
as of march  we had liquidated all but million of our auction rate securities  of which million was held at december  the liquidation of these auction rate securities did not result in any losses 
since then  the continued uncertainty in the credit markets has caused additional auctions with respect to our auction rate securities to fail  which prevented us from liquidating certain of our holdings of auction rate securities 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
however  due to the current lack of liquidity in these investments  we do not intend to invest in auction rate securities in the future 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively  due primarily to the net losses for the periods  excluding stock based compensation and other non cash charges adjusted for changes in working capital 
the increase in cash used in operating activities in compared to was due primarily to the increase in operating expenses associated with the commercialization of tyzeka sebivo and to payments made in connection with the restructuring plan put in place in september the decrease in cash used in operating activities in compared to was due primarily to the receipt of a million license payment from novartis in march offset by an increase in operating expenses

table of contents set forth below is a description of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less one three than to to after one three five five contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases consulting and other agreements total contractual obligations in connection with certain of our operating leases  we have two letters of credit with a commercial bank totaling million which expire at varying dates through december  we have certain potential payment obligations relating to our hbv and hcv product and product candidates 
these obligations are excluded from the contractual obligations table above  as further described below 
pursuant to the license agreement  between us and uabrf  or the uab license agreement  we were granted an exclusive license to the rights that uabrf  emory university and le centre nationale de la recherche scientifique  or cnrs  collectively the licensors  have to a us patent application and progeny thereof and counterpart patent applications in europe  canada  japan and australia that cover the use of certain synthetic nucleosides for the treatment of hbv infection 
in february  uabrf notified us that it and emory university were asserting a claim that  as a result of the filing of a continuation patent application in july by uabrf  the uab license agreement covers our telbivudine technology 
uabrf contended that we are obligated to pay the licensors an aggregate of million comprised of of the million license fee we received from novartis in may in connection with the license of our hbv product candidates and a million payment in connection with the submission to the fda of the ind pursuant to which we have conducted clinical trials of telbivudine 
we disagree with uabrf s contentions and advised uabrf and emory university that we will utilize the dispute resolution procedures set forth in the uab license agreement for resolution of this dispute 
under the terms of that agreement  if resolution cannot be achieved through negotiations between the parties or mediation  it must be decided by binding arbitration under the rules of the american arbitration association before a panel of three arbitrators 
pursuant to the terms of the dispute resolution procedure in the uab license agreement  in september our ceo and the ceo of uabrf met and agreed to begin a mediation process 
while the parties participated in a joint mediation session in january  no resolution of these matters has yet been reached 
however  a non binding settlement proposal has been discussed by the parties 
such settlement proposal remains subject to several terms and conditions  including a full release of all claims by uabrf and related entities 
we do not believe that the matters disputed by uabrf and emory university regarding the uab license agreement will have any effect on either the cooperative agreement with cnrs and the university of montpellier or the technology licenses  including the license for telbivudine  which have been granted to us pursuant to the cooperative agreement 
however  if we do not settle these disputes and it were determined that the uab license agreement does cover our technology  we will become obligated to make payments to the licensors in the amounts and manner specified in the uab license agreement 
while we dispute the demands made by uabrf  if a liability were found to exist  uabrf s claims  in addition to those described above would likely include payments in the aggregate amount of million due upon achievement of regulatory milestones  a royalty on annual sales up to million and a royalty on annual sales greater than million made by us or an affiliate of ours 
additionally  if we sublicense our rights to any entity other than one which holds or controls at least of our capital stock  or if novartis ownership interest in us declines below of our outstanding shares of capital stock  uabrf would likely contend that we would be obligated to pay to the licensors of all royalties received by us from sales by the sublicensee of telbivudine and of all fees  milestone payments and other cash consideration we receive from the sublicensee with respect to telbivudine 
if it were determined that the uab license agreement between us and uabrf does cover our use of telbivudine to treat hbv  or we must otherwise rely upon a license agreement granted by the licensors to 
table of contents commercialize telbivudine  we may be in breach of certain of the representations and warranties we made in the development and commercialization agreement and the stock purchase agreement 
for a further description see collaborations relationship with novartis indemnification and risk factors factors related to our relationship with novartis and factors related to patents and licenses 
separately  we had a research collaboration with cnrs  one of the licensors 
in may  we and novartis entered into an amended and restated cooperative agreement with cnrs and l universite montpellier  or the university of montpellier  pursuant to which we worked in collaboration with scientists from cnrs and the university of montpellier to discover and develop technologies relating to antiviral substances 
the agreement included provisions relating to the ownership and commercialization of the technology  which is discovered or obtained as part of the collaboration as well as rights regarding ownership or use of such technology upon termination of the agreement 
this cooperative agreement expired in december we do not believe that the matters disputed by uabrf and emory university regarding the uab license agreement will have any effect on either our cooperative agreement with cnrs and the university of montpellier or the technology licenses  including the license for telbivudine  which have been granted to us pursuant to the cooperative agreement 
in january  the board of trustees of the university of alabama and related entities filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama  southern division against us  cnrs and the university of montpellier 
the complaint alleges that a former employee of uab is a co inventor of certain patents in the united states and corresponding foreign patent applications related to the use of l deoxy nucleosides for the treatment of hbv assigned to one or more of idenix  cnrs and the university of montpellier and which cover the use of tyzeka sebivo for the treatment of hbv 
the university of alabama has included a demand for damages under various theories in its complaint  but did not specify the amount of damages that it alleges to have incurred 
in response to the complaint in march  we filed a motion to dismiss based upon lack of personal jurisdiction 
in september  the parties agreed to stay the action and pursue mediation relating to the disputes associated with the license agreement and this litigation 
as a result of a joint mediation session held in january  a non binding settlement has been proposed by the parties which could potentially require idenix to make payments to uabrf and related entities 
we have assessed this settlement proposal under the provisions of fas  and recorded an expense of million for the quarter ended december  if the proposed settlement is not completed on terms acceptable to idenix  we will resume the defense of these claims  including through the litigation process 
accruals related to the settlement proposal may be adjusted in future periods if a settlement agreement is not reached 
we cannot ascertain with certainty the likelihood this or any settlement proposal will be accepted by or entered into by the parties 
if we are not able to reach a settlement agreement with the parties  we will continue to vigorously defend against claims made by uabrf and related entities see note 
additionally  in connection with the resolution of matters relating to certain of our hcv product candidates we entered into a settlement agreement with uabrf which provides for a milestone payment of million to uabrf upon receipt of regulatory approval in the united states to market and sell certain hcv products invented or discovered by our chief executive officer during the period from november  to november  this settlement agreement also allows for payments in an amount equal to of worldwide net sales of such hcv products with a minimum sales based payment equal to million 
further  we have potential payment obligations under the license agreement with the university of cagliari pursuant to which we have the exclusive worldwide right to make  use and sell valopicitabine and certain other hcv and hiv technology 
we are liable for certain payments to the university of cagliari if we receive from novartis or another collaborator license fees or milestone payments with respect to such technology 
in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo pharmaceuticals corporation or sumitomo  under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may the settlement agreement which we entered into with sumitomo provides for a million milestone payment to sumitomo if and when the first commercial sale of telbivudine occurs in japan 
in october  we entered into a two year research collaboration agreement with metabasis therapeutics  inc or metabasis 
under the terms of the agreement  metabasis proprietary liver targeted technology would have 
table of contents been applied to certain of our compounds to develop second generation nucleoside analog product candidates for the treatment of hcv 
in july  we notified metabasis that we would exercise our option to terminate the research collaboration on the first anniversary of the agreement in october prior to the termination of the agreement  metabasis asserted that a certain scientific milestone was met and thus a million payment under the collaboration agreement came due 
we do not agree with metabasis assessment that the scientific milestone has been met and therefore do not believe that we have any liability for this payment and have so notified metabasis 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities together with anticipated royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs through late we also estimate that we will generate annual cost savings of million to million as a result of our restructuring 
at any time  it is possible that we may seek additional financing 
we may seek such financing through a combination of public or private financing  collaborative relationships and other arrangements 
additional funding may not be available to us or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  other than novartis  which has the right to maintain its current ownership level 
moreover  any debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants that would not be favorable to us 
our failure to obtain financing when needed may harm our business and operating results 
off balance sheet transactions we currently have no off balance sheet transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to collaborative research and development revenue recognition  accrued expenses and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this document  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements collaborative research and development revenue we recognize revenues relating to our collaborative research and development arrangements in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab  revenues under such collaborative research and development arrangements may include non refundable license fees  milestones  royalties and research and development payments from collaborative partners 
where we have continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement  we recognize non refundable license fees as revenue over the specified development period during which we complete our performance obligations 
when our level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis 
the determination of the performance period involves judgment on the part of our management 
if this estimated performance period changes  then we will adjust the periodic revenue we are recognizing and will record the remaining unrecognized non refundable license fees over the remaining period during which our performance obligations will be completed 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the estimated development period and different assumptions could yield materially different results 
to date  we have received from novartis a million license fee for valopicitabine  a million license fee for tyzeka sebivo and valtorcitabine  and a million reimbursement for reacquiring product rights from 
table of contents sumitomo to develop and commercialize sebivo in certain markets in asia 
we included this reimbursement as part of the license fee for accounting purposes because novartis required the repurchase of these rights as a condition to entering into the development and commercialization agreement 
we also incurred approximately million in costs associated with the development of valopicitabine prior to novartis licensing valopicitabine in march for which novartis has reimbursed us 
we have included the million milestone payment for the regulatory approval of sebivo in the european union as part of the license fee for accounting purposes as the milestone was deemed not to be substantive 
the sum of these non refundable payments received from novartis  totaling million  has been recorded as license fees and is being recognized over the development period of the licensed product candidates 
we review our assessment and judgment on a quarterly basis with respect to the expected duration of the development period of our licensed product candidates 
we have estimated that the performance period during which the development of our licensed product and product candidates will be completed is a period of approximately ten and a half years following the effective date of the development and commercialization agreement that we entered into with novartis  or december we are recognizing revenue on the license fee payments over this period 
if the estimated performance period changes  we will adjust the periodic revenue that is being recognized and will record the remaining unrecognized license fee payments over the remaining development period during which our performance obligations will be completed 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the estimated development period and different assumptions could yield materially different results 
novartis has the right to purchase  at par value of per share  such number of shares as is required to maintain its percentage ownership of our voting stock if we issue shares of capital stock in connection with the acquisition or in licensing of technology through the issuance of up to of our stock in any month period 
the novartis stock purchase rights will remain in effect until the earlier of the date that novartis and its affiliates own less than of our voting stock or the date that novartis becomes obligated to make contingent payments of million to those holders of our stock who sold shares to novartis on may  additionally  if we issue any shares of our capital stock  other than in certain situations  novartis has the right to purchase such number of shares required to maintain its percentage ownership of our voting stock for the same consideration per share paid by others acquiring our stock 
subject to certain exceptions  upon the grant of options and stock awards under stock incentive plans  other than the equity incentive plan  we record  as a reduction of the license fees and payments received from novartis  the fair value of our common stock that would be issuable to novartis  less the exercise price  if any  payable by the option or award holder 
the amount is attributed proportionately between cumulative revenue recognized as of that date and the remaining amount of deferred revenue 
these amounts are adjusted through the date that either novartis elects to exercise its stock subscription rights or the right expires 
these adjustments will also be attributed proportionately between cumulative revenue recognized through the measurement date and the remaining deferred revenue 
in connection with the closing of our initial public offering in july  novartis terminated a common stock subscription right with respect to  shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the equity incentive plan in connection with the exercise of stock options granted after may  in exchange for novartis termination of such right  we issued  shares of our common stock to novartis for a purchase price of per share 
the fair value of these shares was determined to be million at the time of issuance 
as a result of the issuance to novartis of these shares  novartis rights to purchase additional shares as a result of future option grants and stock issuances under the equity incentive plan were terminated and no additional adjustments to revenue and deferred revenue will be required for options exercised under this plan 
prior to the termination of the stock subscription rights under the equity incentive plan  as we granted options that were subject to novartis stock subscription right  the fair value of our common stock that would be issuable to novartis  less par value  was recorded as an adjustment of the license fee and payments received from novartis in may we are still subject to potential revenue adjustments relating to future grants of options and stock awards under our stock incentive plan and other equity plans that our board of directors may approve and stockholders adopt 

table of contents as of december   the cumulative license fee has been reduced by million and has been reclassified to additional paid in capital 
of this amount  million has been recorded as a reduction of deferred revenue as of december  with the remaining amount of million recorded as a reduction of revenue 
the collaboration arrangement with novartis contemplates several joint committees in which we and novartis participate 
we participate in these committees as a means to govern or protect our interests 
the committees span the period from early development through commercialization of product candidates licensed by novartis 
as a result of applying the provisions of sab  which was the applicable revenue guidance at the time the collaboration was entered into  our revenue recognition policy attributes revenue to the development period of the product candidates licensed under the development and commercialization agreement 
we have not attributed revenue to our involvement in the committees following the commercialization of the licensed products as we have determined that our participation on the committees as such participation relates to the commercialization of product candidates is protective 
our determination is based in part on the fact that our expertise is  and has been  the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of human viral and other infectious diseases 
novartis  on the other hand  has and continues to possess the considerable commercialization expertise and infrastructure necessary for the commercialization of such drug candidates 
accordingly  we believe our obligation post commercialization is inconsequential 
in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo pharmaceuticals corporation or sumitomo  under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may we repurchased these product rights for million 
the repurchase of these rights resulted in a million reversal of revenue that we previously recognized under our original arrangements with sumitomo 
we recorded the remaining amount of million as a reduction of deferred revenue 
we have also included million in deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet at december  representing amounts received from sumitomo that we have not included in our revenue to date 
we are required to pay an additional million to sumitomo upon the first commercial sale of telbivudine in japan 
this payment will be recorded first as a reduction of the remaining million of deferred revenue  with the excess recorded as an expense 
if regulatory approval is not received for telbivudine in japan  we would have no further obligations under the settlement agreement with sumitomo and  therefore  the million of remaining deferred revenue would be recognized as revenue at that time 
we recognize payments received from collaborative partners for research and development efforts that we perform or others perform on our behalf as revenue as the related costs are incurred 
we recognize such revenue only if we believe that collection of these amounts is reasonably assured 
this assessment involves judgment on our part 
if we do not believe that collection of amounts billed  or amounts to be billed to our collaborators  is reasonably assured  then we defer revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from milestones related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations upon achievement of the milestone if the milestone is deemed substantive 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone is non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
in  we achieved a regulatory milestone for million during the three months ended march  with the regulatory approval of sebivo in china 
we recognized this regulatory milestone in collaboration revenue from novartis in association with this milestone as the milestone was deemed substantive 
a second regulatory milestones of million was achieved in april with the regulatory approval of sebivo in the european union 
this milestone was deemed not to be substantive and we recognized million as revenue in  representing the portion of the development period that has passed  with the remaining million recorded as 
table of contents deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the remaining development period of our licensed product candidates 
where we have no continuing involvement under a collaborative arrangement  we record non refundable license fee revenue when we have a contractual right to receive the payment  in accordance with the terms of the license agreement  and we record milestones when we receive appropriate notification from the collaborative partner of achievement of the milestones 
in november  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf no 
eitf no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf no 
apply to revenue arrangements entered into on or after july  valuation and impairment of investments and or marketable securities the fair value of our investments and or marketable securities is generally determined from quoted market prices received from pricing services based upon market transactions at fair value 
we also have investments in auction rate securities that consist entirely of municipal debt securities  recorded at fair value at december   which approximates cost due to their variable interest rates  which typically reset through an auction process every seven to days 
this auction mechanism generally allows existing investors to roll over their holdings and continue to own their securities or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value 
because of these short intervals between interest reset dates  we monitor the auctions to ensure they are successful  which provides evidence of their approximate fair values 
to the extent an auction were to fail such that the securities were deemed not to be liquid  we would need to seek other alternatives to determine the fair value of these securities  which may not be based on quoted market transactions 
due to the current lack of liquidity in auction rate securities  we do not intend to invest in auction rate securities in the future 
investments and marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary 
we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other than temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including  among other factors  the duration of the period that  and the extent to which  the fair value is less than cost basis  the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors  and overall market conditions and trends 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  a write down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established 
assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty 
write downs  if recorded  could be materially different from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio  if  among other things  relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that third parties have performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include contract service fees  such as amounts due to clinical research organizations  professional service fees  such as attorneys and accountants  and investigators in conjunction with preclinical and clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of materials related to our product candidates and third party expenses relating to marketing efforts associated with commercialization of our product and product candidates 
accruals for amounts due to clinical research 
table of contents organizations are among our most significant estimates 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual level of services incurred by the service providers 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a reporting period could be overstated or understated 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of services is often subject to our judgment 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us and account for these estimates in accordance with accounting principles involving accrued expenses and income tax liabilities generally accepted in the united states 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standard no

accordingly  financial statement amounts for the periods prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r including the year ended december  have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing required by sfas no

prior to january   we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb no 
and related interpretations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  or fsp fas r in accordance with fsp fas r  entities can choose to follow either the transitional guidance of sfas r or the alternative transition method described in fsp fas r effective in the fourth quarter of  we elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool  or apic pool or windfall  related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of the alternative transition method resulted in no impact on our financial statements 
for purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted in and using the black scholes method  we have made assumptions for the inputs in the model regarding expected dividend yield  risk free interest rate  expected option term and expected volatility 
the amounts recognized for stock based compensation expense could vary depending upon changes in assumptions in the model 
no dividend yield was assumed as we do not pay dividends on our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield of us treasury securities consistent with the expected life of the option in and in 
the expected option term years in and years in and expected volatility in and in were determined by examining the expected option term and volatility of our own stock as well as the expected terms and volatilities of similarly sized biotechnology companies 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in and are based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it should be reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods as options vest  if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
during and  because substantially all of the company s stock option grants vest monthly  no forfeiture assumption was applied 
in our pro forma information required under sfas no 
for the periods prior to fiscal  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred

r and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf eitf requires such equity instruments to be recorded at their fair value at the measurement date  which is generally the vesting date of the instruments 
therefore  the measurement of stock based compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest 
our equity incentive plans are administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors 
the compensation committee determines the type and term of each award  the award exercise or purchase price  if applicable  the number of shares underlying each award granted and the rate at which each award becomes vested or exercisable 
incentive stock options may be granted only to employees at an exercise price per share not less than the fair market value per share of common stock as determined by the board of directors on the date of grant not less than of the fair market value in the case of holders of more than of our common stock and with a term not to exceed ten years from the date of grant five years for incentive stock options granted to holders of more than of our voting common stock 
nonqualified stock options may be granted to any officer  employee  director  consultant or advisor at a per share exercise price in such amount as the compensation committee may determine 
the compensation committee may also grant restricted stock and other stock based awards on terms and conditions it may determine 
these equity incentive plans are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of our consolidated statements of operations  we have allocated stock based compensation to expense categories based on the nature of the service provided by the recipients of the stock option and restricted stock grants 
we expect to continue to grant options to purchase common stock in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  was issued 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that this standard will have on our financial statements

 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property  or eitf  was issued 
eitf prescribes the accounting for collaborations

eitf is effective for all of our collaborations existing after january  we are evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital  while maintaining liquidity  until it is required to fund operations 
to minimize risk  we maintain our operating cash in commercial bank accounts 
we invest our excess cash in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  us government guaranteed debt obligations  repurchase agreements with major financial institutions and certain corporate debt securities with the dollar weighted average effective maturity of the portfolio less than months and no security with an effective maturity in excess of months 
since our investments are short term in duration and the investments are denominated in us dollars  we believe that we are not subject to any material credit  market or foreign exchange risk exposure 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
in addition  the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million to our interest rate sensitive instruments 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 
our investments in auction rate securities consist solely of municipal debt securities and none of the auction rate securities in our portfolio are mortgage backed 
the auction rate securities we held at december  reset is subsequent auctions in january in mid february  certain of our municipal auction rate securities experienced failed auctions 
we held approximately million in municipal auction rate securities at december  as of march  we had liquidated all but million of our auction rate securities  of which million was held at december  the liquidation of these auction rate securities did not result in any losses 
since then  the continued uncertainty in the credit markets has caused additional auctions with respect to our auction rate securities to fail  which prevented us from liquidating certain of our holdings of auction rate securities 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
however  due to the current lack of liquidity in these investments  we do not intend to invest in auction rate securities in the future
