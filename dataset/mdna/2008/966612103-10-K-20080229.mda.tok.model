mergers and acquisitions on march   whitney completed its acquisition of signature financial holdings  inc signature  the parent of signature bank 
signature bank operated seven banking centers in the tampa bay metropolitan area with approximately million in total assets  including million of loans  and million in deposits at acquisition

whitney s financial information includes the results from these acquired operations since the acquisition date 
loans and earning assets total loans at the end of were up  or million  from year end  with approximately  or million  associated with the operations acquired with signature 
loan demand and customer development activity in texas and whitney s louisiana markets outside the metropolitan new orleans area were the major contributors to the organic loan growth over this period 
market conditions continued to restrain the pace of new real estate financing in florida and  since the end of  have contributed to a decrease of approximately million in loans serviced from florida operations  excluding those acquired with signature 
loans  including loans held for sale  comprised of average earning assets in compared to in there was a similar decrease in the percentage of short term investments in the earning asset mix in compared to when the company s liquidity was still impacted by the deposit build up following the hurricanes 
deposits and funding total deposits at december  were up  or million  compared to the end of  mainly reflecting the deposits from the signature acquisition 
after some further reduction in the post storm deposit accumulation in early  whitney has been returning to more normal deposit trends 
average deposits in declined compared to average noninterest bearing deposits funded approximately of average earning assets in  and the percentage of funding from all noninterest bearing sources was for the year 
these percentages  while down from and  respectively  in  are comparable to pre storm levels 
higher cost interest bearing funds  which include time deposits and borrowings  funded of average earning assets in  compared to in  and up somewhat from pre storm levels 
this reflected a number of factors  including the relative attractiveness of rates on the underlying deposit products in response to market rates  increased use of the company s treasury management deposit products by commercial customers with excess liquidity  and the issuance by the bank of million in long term subordinated debt in late march net interest income whitney s net interest income te for decreased million  or  from average earning assets increased between these years  and there was some favorable shift in the mix of assets 
the net interest margin te was for  down basis points from the overall yield on earning assets in was up basis points from  mainly reflecting the shift in asset mix 
the cost of funds increased basis points between these years  mainly in response to the customer driven shift in the funding mix to higher cost sources 
provision for credit losses and credit quality whitney provided million for credit losses in compared to million in whitney s nonperforming loans and loans criticized through its credit risk rating process increased during  mainly reflecting weaknesses identified in residential related credits 
in  loan charge offs  net of recoveries  were million  or

improvement was noted in most all recurring revenue sources 
deposit service charge income grew by compared to  reflecting improved pricing and increased fee potential from business customers in as well as reduced charging opportunities in from the higher post storm liquidity in the deposit base 
increases were also registered for bank card fees  trust service fees  and fees from investment services  mainly reflecting internal growth and contributions from acquired operations

a discussion of certain accounting principles and methods of applying those principles that are particularly important to this process is included in note to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the company is required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in applying these principles to determine the amounts and other disclosures that are presented in the financial statements and discussed in this section 
whitney believes that the determination of its estimate of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its application of other significant accounting policies 
factors considered in this determination and management s process are discussed in note and in the following section on loans  credit risk management and allowance and reserve for credit losses 
although management believes it has identified appropriate factors for review and designed and implemented adequate procedures to support the estimation process that are consistently followed  the allowance remains an estimate about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
over time  changes in economic conditions or the actual or perceived financial condition of whitney s credit customers or other factors can materially impact the allowance estimate  potentially subjecting the company to significant earnings volatility 
management makes a variety of assumptions in applying principles that govern the accounting for benefits under the company s defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
these assumptions are essential to the actuarial valuation that determines the amounts whitney recognizes and certain disclosures it makes in the consolidated financial statements related to the operation of these plans see note in item 
two of the more significant assumptions concern the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate needed to discount projected benefits to their present value 
changes in these assumptions impact the cost of retirement benefits recognized in net income and comprehensive income 
certain assumptions are closely tied to current conditions and are generally revised at each measurement date 
for example  the discount rate is reset annually with reference to market yields on high quality fixed income investments 
other assumptions  such as the rate of return on assets  are determined  in part  with reference to historical and expected conditions over time and are not as susceptible to frequent revision 
holding other factors constant  the cost of retirement benefits will move opposite to changes in either the discount rate or the rate of return on assets 
recent trends in the cost of retirement benefits are discussed in the section on noninterest expense 
financial condition loans  credit risk management and allowance and reserve for credit losses loan portfolio developments total loans at the end of were up  or million  from year end  with approximately  or million  associated with the operations acquired with signature 
loan demand and customer development activity in texas and whitney s louisiana markets outside the metropolitan new orleans area were the major contributors to organic loan growth over this period  with a smaller contribution from the alabama market 
loans serviced by whitney bankers in houston grew by year over year  and those serviced in louisiana markets outside new orleans  grew by 
at december   the percentage of loans serviced from the company s geographic markets was as follows metropolitan new orleans   other louisiana markets   texas   alabama and mississippi   the florida panhandle   and the tampa bay metropolitan area  
market conditions continue to restrain the pace of new real estate project financing in florida and  since the end of  have contributed to a decrease of approximately million in loans serviced from florida operations  excluding those acquired with signature 
table shows loan balances by type of loan at december  and at the end of the previous four years 
the following discussion provides an overview of the composition of the different portfolio sectors and the customers served in each as well as additional information on recent changes 
table loans outstanding by type december  in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial  construction and other real estate residential mortgage individuals total loans the portfolio of commercial loans  other than those secured by real property  increased  or million  between year end and  with only a limited contribution from the signature acquisition 
overall  the portfolio has remained diversified  with customers in a range of industries  including oil and gas exploration and production  marine transportation and maritime construction  wholesale and retail trade in various durable and nondurable products and the manufacture of such products  financial services  and professional services 
the organic growth in market areas outside of metropolitan new orleans has increased the geographic diversification of customers represented in the commercial portfolio 
also included in the commercial loan category are loans to individuals  generally secured by collateral other than real estate  that are used to fund investments in new or expanded business opportunities 
loans outstanding to oil and gas industry customers represented approximately of total loans at december   up from approximately at year end the majority of whitney s customer base in this industry provides transportation and other services and products to support exploration and production activities 
the bank seeks service and supply customers who are quality operators that can manage through volatile commodity price cycles 
with expectations of sustained higher commodity prices  whitney has increased its attention to lending opportunities in the exploration and production sector in recent years  and loans outstanding to this sector comprised over one third of the oil and gas industry portfolio at december  and the bank contracts with a petroleum engineer who supports the underwriting of loans to exploration and production customers 
management  through the bank s credit policy committee  monitors both industry fundamentals and portfolio performance and credit quality on a formal ongoing basis and establishes and adjusts internal exposure guidelines as a percent of capital both for the industry as a whole and for individual sectors within the industry 
the level of activity in this industry continues to have an important impact on the economies of certain portions of whitney s market area  particularly houston and southern louisiana 
outstanding balances under participations in larger shared credit loan commitments totaled million at the end of  including approximately million related to the oil and gas industry 
the total outstanding is up million from year end substantially all of the shared credits are with customers operating in whitney s market area 
the commercial real estate portfolio includes loans for construction and real estate development  both commercial and residential  loans secured by multi family residential properties and other income producing properties  and loans secured by properties used in commercial or industrial operations 
this portfolio sector grew  or million  during the signature acquisition initially added approximately million to this portfolio sector  mainly related to commercial mortgages 
the bank s credit policy committee has also set exposure guidelines for the overall portfolio of commercial real estate loans as well as for loans to developers or owner users that are secured by various subcategories of property 
as with lending to the oil and gas industry  management regularly monitors real estate industry fundamentals and portfolio credit quality 
project financing is an important component of the activity in this portfolio sector  and sector growth is impacted by the availability of new projects as well as the anticipated refinancing of seasoned income properties in the secondary market and payments on residential development loans as inventory is sold 
whitney continues to develop new business in this highly competitive sector throughout its market area  although the pace of new financing has been restrained by recent weaknesses primarily affecting condominium and single family residential development  particularly in certain parts of florida 
much of this sector s growth during came from customers in louisiana markets outside the new orleans metropolitan area and in the houston market  and involved a variety of retail  commercial and industrial facilities  as well as some multi family and single family residential development 
the future pace of new real estate project financing in whitney s market area will reflect the level of confidence by whitney and its customers in the sustainability of economic conditions favorable to successful project completion 
at december   the percentage of the commercial real estate portfolio serviced from the company s geographic markets was as follows metropolitan new orleans   other louisiana markets   texas   alabama and mississippi   the florida panhandle   and the tampa bay metropolitan area  
within the combined portfolios for alabama  mississippi and florida  loans to investors or developers totaled approximately million for construction project financing  million to finance developed and undeveloped land for future construction projects  and million to finance other commercial real estate holdings 
the residential mortgage loan portfolio increased  or million  from the end of to year end growth in this portfolio sector has mainly come both from acquisitions and from the promotion of tailored home mortgage loan products generally targeted to the private client and higher net worth customer base 
the bank continues to sell most conventional residential mortgage loan production in the secondary market 
whitney has no meaningful exposure to sub prime home mortgage loans 
loans to individuals include various consumer installment and credit line products 
the growth in this portfolio sector during came largely through the signature acquisition

written credit policies define underwriting criteria  concentration guidelines  and lending approval processes that cover individual authority and the appropriate involvement of regional loan committees and a senior loan committee 
the senior loan committee includes the bank s senior lenders  senior officers in credit administration  the chief operating officer and the chief executive officer 
commercial credits  including commercial real estate loans  are underwritten principally based upon cash flow coverage  but additional support is regularly obtained through collateralization and guarantees 
commercial loans are typically relationship based rather than transaction driven 
loan concentrations are monitored monthly by management and the board of directors 
consumer loans are centrally underwritten with reference to the customer s debt capacity and with the support of automated credit scoring tools  including appropriate secondary review procedures 
a strong monitoring process is the key to early identification of problem credits 
lending officers are responsible for ongoing monitoring and the assignment of risk ratings to individual loans based on established guidelines 
an independent credit review function reporting to the audit committee of the board of directors assesses the accuracy of officer ratings and the timeliness of rating changes and performs concurrent reviews of the underwriting processes 
once a problem relationship over a certain size threshold is identified  a quarterly watch committee process is initiated 
the watch committee  composed of senior lending and credit administration management  must approve any substantive changes to identified problem credits and will assign relationships to a special credits department when appropriate 
management s evaluation of credit risk in the loan portfolio is reflected in the estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio that is reported in the company s financial statements as the allowance for loan losses 
changes in this evaluation over time are reflected in the provision for credit losses charged to expense 
the methodology for determining the allowance involves significant judgment  and important factors that influence this judgment are re evaluated quarterly to respond to changing conditions 
the recorded allowance encompasses three key elements allowances established for losses on criticized loans  allowances based on historical loss experience for loans with acceptable credit quality and groups of homogeneous loans not individually rated  and allowances based on general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors internal and external to the company 
criticized loans are credits with above average weaknesses as identified through the internal risk rating process 
criticized loans include those that are deemed to be impaired because all contractual amounts probably will not be collected as they become due 
specific allowances are determined for impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s contractual interest rate  the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  or  when available  the loan s observable market price 
the allowance for the remainder of criticized loans is calculated by applying loss factors to loan balances aggregated by the severity of the internal risk rating 
the loss factors applied to criticized loans are determined with reference to the results of migration analysis  which analyzes the charge off experience over time for loans within each rating category 
for the second element of the allowance  loans assessed as having average or better credit quality with similar risk ratings and homogeneous loans not subject to individual rating  such as residential mortgage loans  consumer installment loans and draws under consumer credit lines  are grouped together and individual loss factors are applied to each group 
the loss factors for homogeneous loan groups are based on average historical charge off information 
industry based factors are applied to other portfolio segments for which a migration analysis has not been implemented 
determining the final element of the allowance involves assessing how other current factors  both internal and external  impact the accuracy of results obtained for the other two elements 
internally  management must consider whether trends have been identified in the quality of underwriting and loan administration as well as in the timely identification of credit quality issues 
management also monitors shifts in portfolio concentrations and other changes in portfolio characteristics that indicate levels of risk not fully captured in the loss factors 
external factors include local and national economic trends  as well as changes in the economic fundamentals of specific industries that are well represented in whitney s customer base 
management has established procedures to help ensure a consistent approach to this inherently judgmental process over time 
the monitoring of credit risk also extends to unfunded credit commitments  such as unused commercial credit lines and letters of credit  and management establishes reserves as needed for its estimate of probable losses on such commitments 
credit quality statistics and components of credit loss allowance and reserve the total of loans criticized through the company s credit risk rating process increased million during to million at december   or of the total loan portfolio 
loans for residential development  investment and other residential purposes comprised approximately of the criticized total at year end and produced most of the overall net increase in criticized loans during the year 
nonresidential real estate loans accounted for approximately of the criticized total  with the underlying collateral fairly evenly divided between income producing properties and owner occupied properties 
loans to traditional commercial and industrial relationships comprised approximately of the criticized total  with no significant concentrations related to industries or markets 
whitney has no meaningful exposure to sub prime home mortgage loans 
the criticized loan total at december  included million of loans identified as having well defined weaknesses that would likely result in some loss if not corrected  an increase of million from the end of there was a million increase in the total of loans warranting special attention since the end of the total for this rating category at year end was million 
loans for which full repayment is in doubt totaled million at december   up million from the end of the changes in each of these rating categories during mainly reflected weaknesses in residential related loans 
the allowance determined for criticized loans at december   including those separately evaluated for impairment  increased million from year end included in the total of criticized loans at december  is million of nonperforming loans  which is up million from year end this increase also came predominantly from residential related loans  mainly in florida and alabama  including one million credit for a florida development with project specific issues not directly related to overall market conditions 
approximately of the total of nonperforming loans at december  was from whitney s florida operations and from alabama 
another of the total was from louisiana operations  mainly concentrated in commercial and industrial credits

whitney s policy for placing loans on nonaccrual status is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the overall allowance determined as of december  was million above the allowance at year end  mainly reflecting the increase in the allowance determined for criticized loans noted above 
the allowance for loans with average or better credit quality ratings and loans not subject to individual rating increased million from the end of to december   mainly driven by loan growth 
during  whitney reversed the remaining million component of the allowance that had reflected the estimate of the incremental impact of the storms on losses in the consumer credit sectors of the portfolio 
the performance of these portfolio sectors  which were not subject to individual detailed storm impact reviews  proved better than anticipated and did not exhibit the delayed credit problems seen in the aftermath of similar disasters 
management s relative assessment of economic and other qualitative risk factors between these dates had little impact  as reduced uncertainty regarding surrounding post storm economic progress was offset by concerns over more recent economic trends  including both the severe downturn in the housing market and growing signs of a broader economic slowdown 
table recaps activity in the allowance for loan losses and in the reserve for losses on unfunded credit commitments over the past five years

securities available for sale made up the bulk of the total investment portfolio at december  gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale totaled million at december  and were mainly related to mortgage backed securities 
the gross losses represented of the total amortized cost of the underlying securities 
note to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k provides information on the process followed by management to evaluate whether unrealized losses on securities  both those available for sale and those held to maturity  represent impairment that is other than temporary and that should be recognized with a charge to operations 
substantially all the unrealized losses at december  resulted from increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased 
management identified no value impairment related to credit quality in the portfolio  and whitney holds no securities that are tied to sub prime home mortgage loans 
in addition  management has the intent and ability to hold these securities until the market based impairment is recovered  therefore  no value impairment was determined to be other than temporary

deposits and borrowings total deposits at december  were up  or million  compared to a year earlier  mainly reflecting the deposits added with the signature acquisition 
this followed a decrease of  or million  from year end to the end of the surge in deposits after the late summer hurricanes of peaked around the end of the first quarter of  and anticipated reductions became evident mainly over the second half of after some further reduction in early in the post storm deposit accumulation  whitney has been returning to more normal deposit trends later in the year  both with respect to seasonal fluctuations and overall growth rates

the anticipated reductions to these storm related deposits as well as some migration to higher yielding products contributed to a  or million  decrease in lower cost deposits from december  to the end of  and a decrease of  or million  in the two years since december  noninterest bearing demand deposits comprised of total deposits at december   comparable to pre storm levels  but down from a year earlier and at the end of higher cost time deposits at december  were up  or million  compared to year end  with approximately million associated with signature 
a portion of this growth reflected efforts to attract new customers in certain parts of whitney s market area where banking relationships were disrupted by mergers of competitors 
time deposits of  or more include competitively bid public funds and excess funds of certain commercial and private banking customers that are maintained in treasury management deposit products pending redeployment for corporate or investment purposes 
whitney has attracted these funds partly as an alternative to other short term borrowings 
customers held million of funds in treasury management deposit products at december   up million from the total held at december  strong liquidity among whitney s commercial customers  particularly those in the oil and gas industry and in heavy construction  has supported this growth 
public fund time deposits totaled million at year end  which was million lower than the end of table maturities of time deposits deposits of deposits of less than in thousands or more total three months or less over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months total short term and other borrowings at december  were up  or million  from year end the main source of short term borrowings has been the sale of securities under repurchase agreements to customers using whitney s treasury management sweep product 
total borrowings from customers under repurchase agreements increased approximately  or million  from year end to the end of  reflecting in part certain large customer transactions at the end of the current year 
average borrowings under repurchase agreements increased  or million  between and the strong liquidity in the commercial customer base has also supported the growth in this source of funds 
because of the underlying customer relationship  these borrowings can be a relatively stable source of funds 
additional information on borrowings  including yields and maximum amounts borrowed  is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
in late march  the bank issued million in ten year subordinated notes to augment the bank s regulatory capital and enhance its capacity for future growth

liquidity management and contractual obligations liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available to meet cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting the operating  capital and strategic cash flow needs of the company and the bank 
whitney develops its liquidity management strategies and measures and monitors liquidity risk as part of its overall asset liability management process  making full use of quantitative modeling tools available to project cash flows under a variety of possible scenarios 
projections are also made assuming credit stressed conditions  although such conditions are not currently anticipated 
liquidity management on the asset side primarily addresses the composition and maturity structure of the loan portfolio and the portfolio of investment securities and their impact on the company s ability to generate cash flows from scheduled payments  contractual maturities  and prepayments  through use as collateral for borrowings  and through possible sale or securitization 
table above presents the contractual maturity structure of the loan portfolio and table presents contractual investment maturities 
on the liability side  liquidity management focuses on growing the base of core deposits at competitive rates  including the use of treasury management products for commercial customers  while at the same time ensuring access to economical wholesale funding sources 
the section above on deposits and borrowings discusses changes in these liability funding sources in the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb system  which provides the bank access to a variety of fhlb advance products as an alternative source of funds 
in addition  both the company and the bank have access to external funding sources in the financial markets  and the bank has developed the ability to gather deposits at a nationwide level  although it has not used this ability to date 
cash generated from operations is another important source of funds to meet liquidity needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows located in item of this annual report on form k present operating cash flows and summarize all significant sources and uses of funds for each year in the three year period ended december  at december   whitney holding corporation had approximately million in cash and demand notes from the bank available to provide liquidity for acquisitions  dividend payments to shareholders  stock repurchases or other corporate uses  before consideration of any future dividends that may be received from the bank 
during  the bank will have available an amount equal to approximately million plus its current net income to declare as dividends to the company without prior regulatory approval 
contractual obligations table summarizes payments due from the company and the bank under specified long term and certain other contractual obligations as of december  obligations under deposit contracts and short term borrowings are not included 
the maturities of time deposits are scheduled in table above in the section on deposits and borrowings 
purchase obligations represent legal and binding contracts to purchase services or goods that cannot be settled or terminated without paying substantially all of the contractual amounts 
not included are a number of contracts entered into to support ongoing operations that either do not specify fixed or minimum amounts of goods or services or are cancelable on short notice without cause and without significant penalty 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide a picture of whitney s ability to fund these and other more significant cash operating expenses  such as interest expense and compensation and benefits  out of current operating cash flows

b obligations under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are not included 
whitney anticipates making a pension contribution of approximately million during no significant near term payments are expected under the unfunded nonqualified pension plan 
a million nonqualified plan obligation was recorded at year end c the recorded obligation for postretirement benefits other than pensions was million at december  the funding to purchase benefits for current retirees  net of retiree contributions  has not been significant 
off balance sheet arrangements as a normal part of its business  the company enters into arrangements that create financial obligations that are not recognized  wholly or in part  in the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these arrangements  such as noncancelable operating leases  are reflected in table above 
the most significant off balance sheet obligations are the bank s commitments under traditional credit related financial instruments 
table schedules these commitments as of december  by the periods in which they expire 
commitments under credit card and personal credit lines generally have no stated maturity 
table credit related commitments commitments expiring by period from december  less than more than in thousands total year years years years loan commitments revolving loan commitments nonrevolving credit card and personal credit lines standby and other letters of credit total revolving loan commitments are issued primarily to support commercial activities 
the availability of funds under revolving loan commitments generally depends on whether the borrower continues to meet credit standards established in the underlying contract and has not violated other contractual conditions 
a number of such commitments are used only partially or  in some cases  not at all before they expire 
credit card and personal credit lines are generally subject to cancellation if the borrower s credit quality deteriorates  and many lines remain partly or wholly unused 
unfunded balances on revolving loan commitments and credit lines should not be used to project actual future liquidity requirements 
nonrevolving loan commitments are issued mainly to provide financing for the acquisition and development or construction of real property  both commercial and residential  although many are not expected to lead to permanent financing by the bank 
expectations about the level of draws under all credit related commitments are incorporated into the company s liquidity and asset liability management models 
substantially all of the letters of credit are standby agreements that obligate the bank to fulfill a customer s financial commitments to a third party if the customer is unable to perform 
the bank issues standby letters of credit primarily to provide credit enhancement to its customers other commercial or public financing arrangements and to help them demonstrate financial capacity to vendors 
the bank has historically had minimal calls to perform under standby agreements 
asset liability management the objective of the company s asset liability management is to implement strategies for the funding and deployment of its financial resources that are expected to maximize soundness and profitability over time at acceptable levels of risk 
interest rate sensitivity is the potential impact of changing rate environments on both net interest income and cash flows 
the company has developed a model to measure its interest rate sensitivity over the near term by running net interest income simulations and monitors longer term interest rate risk by modeling the sensitivity of its economic value of equity 
the model can be used to test the company s sensitivity in various economic environments 
the model incorporates management s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates 
assumptions can also be entered into the model to evaluate the impact of possible strategic responses to changes in the competitive environment 
management  through the company s investment and asset liability committee  monitors simulation results against rate sensitivity guidelines specified in whitney s asset liability management policy 
the net interest income simulations run at the end of indicated that whitney was moderately asset sensitive over the near term  similar to its position at year end based on these simulations  annual net interest income te would be expected to increase million  or  and decrease million  or  if interest rates instantaneously increased or decreased  respectively  from current rates by basis points 
these changes are measured against the results of a base simulation run that uses growth forecasts as of the measurement date and that assumes a stable rate environment and structure 
the comparable simulation run at year end produced results that ranged from a positive impact on net interest income te of million  or  to a negative impact of million  or the actual impact that changes in interest rates have on net interest income will depend on many factors 
these factors include whitney s ability to achieve expected growth in earning assets and maintain a desired mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the actual timing when assets and liabilities reprice  the magnitude of interest rate changes and corresponding movement in interest rate spreads  and the level of success of asset liability management strategies that are implemented 
changes in interest rates affect the fair values of financial instruments 
the earlier section on investment securities and notes and to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k contain information regarding fair values 
the company has made minimal use of investments in financial instruments or participations in agreements with values that are linked to or derived from changes in the value of some underlying asset or index 
these are commonly referred to as derivatives and include such instruments as interest rate swaps  futures  forward contracts  option contracts  and other financial arrangements with similar characteristics 
management continues to evaluate whether to make additional use of derivatives as part of its asset liability and liquidity management processes

declines in libor based indices lagged as overall market rates eased in the latter part of  but have resumed more normal patterns in early the yield te on the largely fixed rate investment portfolio improved basis points between and the overall cost of funds for increased basis points from  mainly in response to the shift in the funding mix toward higher cost sources coupled with continued pressure from competitive market rates 
average deposits in declined compared to average noninterest bearing deposits funded approximately of average earning assets in  and the percentage of funding from all noninterest bearing sources was for the year 
these percentages  while down from and  respectively  in  are comparable to pre storm levels 
higher cost interest bearing funds  which include time deposits and borrowings  funded of average earning assets in  compared to in  and up somewhat from pre storm levels 
this reflected a number of factors  including the relative attractiveness of rates on the underlying deposit products in response to market rates  increased use of the company s treasury management deposit products by commercial customers with excess liquidity  and the issuance of million in long term subordinated bank debt in late march overall  whitney continues to be moderately asset sensitive over the near term 
as the overall economic outlook has weakened  management has anticipated downward pressure on market interest rates and is continuing to aggressively manage its deposit and loan rates to mitigate the impact of the rate environment on its net interest income

net interest income te increased million  or  in compared to  driven by growth in average earning assets between these periods and a basis point widening of the net interest margin 
the most important factors behind the increase in net interest income in were earning asset growth  supported in part by the funds retained from the post storm deposit build up  higher short term market interest rates  the favorable impact on the funding mix of post storm liquidity in the deposit base  and active management of the pricing structure for both loans and deposits 
a portion of the increase in average earning assets in reflected the significant influx of deposit funds that followed the late summer hurricanes in which were mainly deployed in short term investments 
liquidity management investments increased to of average earning assets in as compared to in  while loans comprised of earning assets in  down from in the overall yield on earning assets increased basis points to in  despite the higher percentage of lower yielding short term investments in the earning asset mix compared to the main factor behind the overall yield improvement was the rise in benchmark rates for the large variable rate segment of whitney s loan portfolio 
loan yields te for were up basis points compared to the yield te on the largely fixed rate investment portfolio improved basis points between and the growth in earning assets in was funded primarily by a increase in average deposits compared to the funds retained during from the post storm deposit build up contributed to a favorable shift in the overall funding mix compared to and supported whitney s efforts to control the upward market pressure on funding rates through deposit pricing management

noninterest income table shows the components of noninterest income for each year in the three year period ended december   along with the percent changes between years for each component 
the total includes the million gain recognized on the final settlement of insurance claims that had arisen primarily from the hurricanes 
excluding this gain and income associated with foreclosed assets and surplus property  noninterest income grew  or million  in and  or million  in table noninterest income dollars in thousands change change service charges on deposit accounts bank card fees trust service fees secondary mortgage market operations credit related fees investment services income atm fees other fees and charges other operating income net gain on sales and other revenue from foreclosed assets a a net gain loss on disposals of surplus property a a securities transactions a a total noninterest income a percentage change not meaningful 
income from service charges on deposit accounts increased  or million  in  following an decline between and service charges include fees for specific transactions or services  such as processing return items or wire transfers  periodic account maintenance fees for both business and personal customers  and other revenue associated with deposit accounts  such as commissions on check sales 
charges earned on specific transactions and services in were up  or million  compared to this followed a decrease of 
million in compared to the main component of this income category is fees earned on items returned for insufficient funds and for overdrafts 
the higher deposit account balances maintained after the storms by customers in the areas most impacted had reduced charging opportunities in the latter part of and through much of the first half of the increase in income in reflected a return to more normal levels of fees charged as well as some improved pricing 
broad trends in how customers execute transactions have been reducing charging opportunities in recent years 
account maintenance fees for business customers were up  or 
million  in  after decreasing  or million  in the fees charged on a large number of whitney s business accounts are based on an analysis of account activity  and these customers are allowed to offset accumulated charges with an earnings credit based on balances maintained in the account 
the short term market rates used to calculate the earnings credit rates declined slightly on average between and  with a more rapid decrease toward the end of and into early  and this supported a  or 
million  increase in analysis account fees in earnings credit rates rose with the underlying market rates throughout and the first half of contributing to a  or million  decrease in analysis account fees in compared to analysis fee income in the early part of was also negatively impacted by higher levels of liquidity in the deposit base 
trends in processing business transactions have led to reduced volumes of chargeable account activity in recent years 
personal account service charges were stable between and  after decreasing 
million from to high deposit base liquidity was a factor behind the 
million decrease in personal account service charges between and  as was the impact of the loss of some storm dislocated customers 
aggressive competition has held down the pricing for fees charged to service these deposit accounts 
bank card fees increased  or million  in and  or million  in this income category includes fees from activity on bank issued debit and credit cards as well as from merchant processing services 
transaction volume on bank issued cards was up approximately in and in there had been a surge in transaction volume in the latter part of  particularly from debit card activity  indicating in part a change in payment behavior within the customer base dislocated by that year s late summer storms 
the continuation of this behavioral change and the introduction of a rewards program for credit card customers helped increase debit card transaction volume by in and credit card volume by compared to these growth rates moderated in  when debit card volume was up and credit card volume increased 
ongoing customer development efforts and improved market conditions for much of the year helped increase trust service fees by  or million  in this followed a increase in compared to that was mainly driven by new business  including the addition of the trust business acquired with first national bancshares  inc  and generally favorable market conditions 
whitney has positioned relationship officers to attract and service trust and wealth management customers across its market area 
fee income generated by whitney s secondary mortgage market operations decreased in after growing in completed sales of home loans totaled approximately million in  million in and million in relatively broad weakness in the overall housing market is expected to persist well into  although whitney has positioned additional resources in market areas with the best potential for loan production 
investment services income increased  or 
million  in  following a  or million  increase in compared to investment services include stock brokerage and annuity sales as well as fixed income securities transactions for correspondent banks and other commercial and personal customers 
the investment services operations of acquired banks contributed to the income improvement in whitney is nearing completion of its migration to a new investment services platform through which it can offer expanded investment options  products and services to current and prospective customers 
atm fees in had been reduced by a temporary fee waiver policy instituted shortly after the late summer storms and by the temporary unavailability of certain equipment 
fees generated by insurance operations were the main factor behind the increase in the total for other fees and charges for rising premiums and changes in the type of coverage available from different insurance carriers contributed to this improvement 
the settlement of a pension liability from an acquired entity produced a gain of 
million in that was included with other operating income 
during  pulse eft association was sold to discover financial services 
as a member of the pulse electronic payment network  whitney received distributions totaling approximately million that were reported with other operating income for the net gain on sales and other revenue from foreclosed assets includes income from grandfathered assets that varies from year to year as opportunities for sales arise 
the net gain or loss recognized in each period from dispositions of surplus banking property is also shown in table management evaluates its banking facilities on an ongoing basis to identify possible under utilization and to determine the need for functional improvements  relocations or possible sales 
noninterest expense table shows the components of noninterest expense for each year in the three year period ended december   along with the percent changes between years for each component 
noninterest expense increased  or million  in  following an increase of  or million  from to incremental operating costs associated with acquired operations  including the amortization of acquired intangibles  totaled approximately million in and million in initiatives undertaken to reduce whitney s exposure to natural disasters and make its disaster recovery plans and operating arrangements more resilient following the late summer storms of added a new layer of recurring expense beginning in that mainly impacted the occupancy  data processing and equipment and telecommunication expense categories 
as a result of the catastrophic storm season  the company also saw the cost of its casualty insurance increase substantially 
nonrecurring or irregular expense items associated with the storms were incurred in each of the years shown in table these totaled approximately million in  million in and million in certain of these expense items are detailed in the following discussion of changes in individual expense categories 
table noninterest expense dollars in thousands change change employee compensation employee benefits total personnel net occupancy equipment and data processing telecommunication and postage corporate value and franchise taxes legal and other professional services amortization of intangibles security and other outsourced services advertising and promotion operating supplies bank card processing services deposit insurance and regulatory fees miscellaneous operating losses other operating expense total noninterest expense employee compensation increased  or million  in  and was up  or million  in employee compensation includes base pay and contract labor costs  compensation earned under sales based and other employee incentive programs  and compensation expense under management incentive plans 
base pay  the cost of contract labor and compensation earned under sales based incentive programs increased  or million  in  with approximately million of the total increase related to the staff of acquired operations 
this followed an increase of  or million  from to  when acquired operations contributed approximately million to the total change 
compensation under incentive programs was up million in  reflecting both the growth in certain fee based income categories discussed earlier and an improvement in estimated performance levels used to determine annual incentives for basic banking services 
excluding the impact of acquisitions in each year  whitney s full time equivalent staff grew on average by in compared to  as staff additions to fill openings caused by storm related attrition were largely offset by reductions identified as part of recent cost control programs 
there was a reduction in the average staff level in compared to  again excluding the impact of acquisitions 
this reduction reflected the impact of temporary storm related attrition and some branch closures  but the benefit to expense in from this staff reduction was offset by additional contract labor  some of which continued into compensation expense in both and was negatively impacted by salary scale adjustments needed to address post storm changes in the cost of living in impacted areas and increased competition for limited labor resources 
compensation expense associated with management incentive programs increased by million in  with million related to share based compensation and the remainder to the cash bonus incentive program 
management incentive program expense increased million in compared to  almost all related to share based compensation 
share based incentives currently include restricted stock and stock units  both performance based and tenure based  and stock options 
restricted stock and stock unit expense increased million in and million in participation in restricted stock and stock unit awards expanded in recent years  and the awards for had been increased mainly in recognition of the special employee efforts required in the aftermath of the hurricanes 
the awards returned to a level more consistent with pre storm awards 
stock option compensation increased 
million in after adding 
million to expense in sfas no 
r  share based payment  required companies to expense the fair value of option awards beginning in overall  options awards have been deemphasized in recent years 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k for more information on share based compensation 
employee benefits expense decreased  or million  in  following an increase of  or million  in the major components of employee benefits expense  in addition to payroll taxes  are the cost of providing health benefits for active and retired employees and the cost of providing pension benefits through both the defined benefit plans and a k employee savings plan 
the performance of the pension trust fund and trends in market yields on fixed income securities in one period can cause the actuarially determined periodic expense for the defined benefit pension plan to move in the opposite direction in future periods  holding other variables constant 
a 
million decrease in pension expense in followed a moderate increase during in the market yields referenced to determine the appropriate rate for discounting projected pension benefits  and investment performance in was above the long term expected rate of return 
pension expense increased 
million in after a moderate decline during in fixed income market yields and the discount rate 
investment performance in was below the long term expected rate of return 
the effect of these factors on pension expense was somewhat offset by the favorable impact of a million employer contribution to the pension trust toward the end of pension expense is expected to show a small increase in  reflecting in part higher referenced market yields at year end and an investment performance for below long term expectations 
in early  the company amended its postretirement health and life insurance benefit plans to eliminate the benefits for most employees and freeze benefit levels for remaining participants 
the impact of this amendment reduced employee benefits expense for by million compared to no significant plan expense is expected for and subsequent years 
trends in fixed income market yields also impact the actuarial valuation results for postretirement health benefits as do trends in actual benefit outlays 
unfavorable benefit experience and lower market yields for the valuation had contributed to a 
million expense increase in net occupancy expense increased  or million  in  following a  or million  increase in compared to both and included million of incremental costs associated with acquired operations 
the post storm annual increase in casualty insurance totaled approximately million  with million reflected in and the remaining 
million in recurring costs associated with improving whitney s disaster risk posture added approximately 
million to occupancy expense and a similar amount to other factors that drove the increases for both and included de novo branch expansion  the completion of capital projects on storm damaged facilities and normal lease escalations 
increased energy costs in continued in  with sustained higher fuel costs 
work on a number of maintenance and repair projects was also included in  some of which had been deferred from although storm related facility closures and asset retirements reduced certain recurring occupancy costs after the storms in  these savings were for the most part offset by a corresponding loss of office rental revenue 
equipment and data processing expense increased  or million  in  with 
million of incremental costs for acquired operations 
in  equipment and data processing expense increased  or million  of which 
million was for acquired operations 
approximately million of the increase in and over million of the increase in compared to was associated with the initiatives to improve operational resiliency in the event of a natural disaster  including the accelerated installation of a new mainframe computer and related software 
de novo branch expansion and projects to enhance operational capacity and implement new customer applications were the main contributors to the remaining increases in both and the total expense for professional services  both legal and other services  declined million in  following an increase of million in the expense for nonlegal professional services was down million in  after increasing million in compared to included in was million for work on initiatives to improve the company s disaster risk profile 
in  whitney also engaged consultants in the planning of upgrades to major customer interface tools and core application systems and the development and implementation of product enhancements  as well as in the executive succession planning process 
certain projects continued into and some new projects were added 
the company also performed an extensive review and update of its strategic plan in that is in the process of being implemented 
legal expense increased 
million in compared to this category covers legal services for both loan collection efforts and general corporate matters 
although included 
million for services associated with finalizing the insurance settlement mentioned above  whitney also successfully recovered some relatively significant costs on loan collection and other matters during this year 
loan collection efforts in  including work with storm impacted customers  and storm related disruptions to law firms and the legal system in late combined to account for most of a 
million increase in legal expense in the increase in criticized loan totals in the latter part of indicates sustained demand for loan collection legal services in amortization of intangibles is mainly associated with the value of deposit relationships acquired in bank and branch acquisitions 
amortization expense of million is scheduled for note to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k reviews recently completed acquisitions and note presents additional information on intangible assets subject to amortization 
the expense for security and other outsourced services increased  or million  in this followed a  or million  increase in compared to acquired operations added 
million to expense and 
million to the outsourcing of the bank s lockbox function added approximately 
million to expense 
approximately million of the increase in related to a new arrangement to outsource the bank s atm operations that was phased in during during  the bank also incurred additional expense for the transportation of daily work  mainly reflecting changes in processing sites in the post storm operating environment as well as the use of more costly delivery methods for a number of months following the storms 
the cost of certain services in storm impacted areas also increased with local wage scales 
management directed additional resources to advertising and promotional activities in to support major campaigns to introduce new and improved products 
whitney focused on more targeted marketing efforts in both and  with no major campaigns executed in either year 
current plans for advertising and promotional activities in indicate a level of expense more in line with and bank card processing services expense will vary mainly with changes in transaction volume on bank issued credit cards 
transaction volumes and bank card fee income are discussed in the earlier section on noninterest income 
in november  the fdic adopted final regulations that set the deposit insurance assessment rates that took effect in the new rate structure imposed a minimum annual assessment of from five to seven cents for every of domestic deposits on institutions that are assigned the lowest risk category under the fdic s risk based assessment system 
under the previous rate structure  this group of institutions  which includes the bank  had been charged no assessment for a number of years 
the actual assessment for of approximately million was offset by a one time assessment credit  and no expense was recognized 
based on recent deposit levels and the bank s current risk classification  the annual minimum assessment in would range from approximately million to million  although current rates are at the lower end of the range 
the million one time credit remaining at december  can offset up to of the assessment expense and should be fully used in miscellaneous operating losses included various charges directly related to the storms totaling million in  million in and million in in  the company recorded a charge of million to establish a liability with respect to its obligation as a member of visa usa  inc to share in certain litigation losses that have been or may be incurred by visa  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the expense categories included in other operating expense decreased  or million  on a combined basis in  following an increase of  or million  in compared to included million for the cost of disaster contingency housing  which was substantially eliminated in  and certain other storm related items that were nonrecurring in also contributing to the increase in was the initial expensing of the annual stock option award for directors 
the totals for both and included a 
million contribution to a disaster assistance fund for whitney s employees 
income taxes the company provided for income tax expense at an effective rate of in  in and in whitney s effective tax rate has been lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily because of tax exempt interest income from the financing of state and local governments and the availability of tax credits generated by investments in affordable housing projects 
federal disaster relief legislation passed in december provided for a tax credit to businesses in the storm affected areas based on certain salaries paid to qualifying employees 
the following reconciles reported income tax expense to that computed at the statutory federal tax rate for each year in the three year period ended december  table income taxes in thousands income tax expense at of pre tax income increase decrease resulting from tax exempt income low income housing credits disaster relief credit state income tax and miscellaneous items income tax expense reported louisiana sourced income of commercial banks is not subject to state income taxes 
rather  banks in louisiana pay a tax based on the value of their capital stock in lieu of income and franchise taxes  and this tax is allocated to parishes in which the banks maintain branches 
whitney s corporate value tax is included in noninterest expense 
this expense will fluctuate in part based on the growth in the bank s equity and earnings and in part based on market valuation trends for the banking industry 
fourth quarter results whitney earned million for the quarter ended december   compared with net income of million for the fourth quarter of earnings were 
per diluted share in s fourth quarter  compared to 
for the year earlier period 
selected fourth quarter highlights follow whitney s net interest income te decreased less than  or 
million  from the fourth quarter of average earning assets increased between these periods  with little change in the mix of assets 
the net interest margin te was for the fourth quarter of  down basis points from the year earlier period 
the overall yield on earning assets decreased basis points  mainly reflecting a decline between these periods in benchmark rates for the large variable rate segment of whitney s loan portfolio and the impact of a higher level of nonaccruing loans in the most recent period 
the cost of funds increased basis points between the fourth quarters of and  mainly in response to the customer driven shift in the funding mix toward higher cost sources 
net interest income te for the fourth quarter of was also down less than  or 
million  from the third quarter of average earning assets increased between these periods  while the net interest margin decreased basis points 
there was some favorable mix of earning assets between these periods  but the funding mix was little changed

of average loans on an annualized basis 
the allowance for loans losses increased to of total loans at december  the total of loans criticized through the company s credit risk rating process increased million during the fourth quarter of  mainly related to loans for residential development and investment and other residential purposes 
noninterest income increased  or million  from the fourth quarter of  with gains noted in almost all recurring revenue sources 
deposit service charge income was up  or 
million  driven mainly by improved pricing 
bank card fees increased  or

the incremental expense associated with acquired operations totaled approximately million in the fourth quarter of  including amortization of acquired intangibles 
whitney s personnel expense increased  or million  in total  including 
million for the staff of acquired operations 
million of the increase in personnel expense was associated with management incentive programs  mainly related to share based incentives  and an additional million came from employee incentive plans 
each of these partly reflected the impact of updates to annual performance factor estimates in each quarterly period 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  the average full time equivalent staff level declined approximately between these periods  with staff reductions identified under cost control programs 
the total of all other noninterest expense unrelated to personnel decreased a net million  or  compared to the fourth quarter of expenses in the prior year s quarter included million of nonrecurring or periodic expense either directly associated with the storms or associated with the company s efforts to reduce its disaster risk profile 
in the fourth quarter of  whitney recorded a pre tax charge of million to establish a liability with respect to its obligation as a member of visa usa  inc to share in certain of visa s litigation losses
