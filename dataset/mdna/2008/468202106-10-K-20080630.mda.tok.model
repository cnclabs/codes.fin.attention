fiscal year ended april  as compared to the fiscal year ended april  total revenues total revenues decreased million  or  primarily due to a decrease in the number of tax returns prepared by our network  lower financial product fees earned under our agreements with sbb t  hsbc and republic and lower territory sales as compared to fiscal excluding esp tax returns  our network of franchised and company owned offices prepared million tax returns in fiscal million total tax returns  a decline of as compared to fiscal a decline of for total tax returns 
these reductions were partially offset by service revenues of million earned at the company owned offices we added in fiscal through acquisitions 
excluding esp tax returns  average revenues per tax return prepared remained essentially flat as compared to last year a decrease of for total returns 
customer retention was just under in fiscal as compared to just over in fiscal same store tax return volume decreased approximately excluding esp tax returns and was down for all tax returns 
contributors to the overall decline in the number of tax returns prepared were as follows i lack of a pre season product to help attract customers into our stores in the january and early february timeframe 
we not only lacked a pre season product but we also underestimated the retention impact this would have on our early season results 
for the first month of the tax season  we were down approximately  tax returns as compared to the first month of last tax season on a day over day comparative basis 
although we experienced growth in the late season  we were not able to completely overcome our slow start 
ii the continued negative publicity surrounding the doj lawsuits and the ineffectiveness of marketing messages 
we experienced continued weakness in our brand  more so than our research predicted in certain markets that were impacted by the doj lawsuits 
additionally  our overall marketing messages and programs did not succeed in creating customer demand throughout the tax season 
iii the impact of our increased compliance efforts 
as a result of the internal review  a variety of enhancements in the areas of tax return preparation compliance and monitoring were implemented during the year 
however  the time and effort put forth in the implementation likely had some negative impact on the tax return levels in tax season 
table of contents furthermore  an important element of our location strategy is that the maturation of our offices from which the average number of tax returns prepared per office increases as offices age 
our retail partner locations typically prepare fewer tax returns as they tend to be smaller in size than typical storefront locations

liquidity and capital resources historical sources and uses of cash from operations seasonality of cash flows the tax return preparation business is highly seasonal resulting in substantially all of our revenues and cash flow being generated during the period from january through april following the tax season  from may through december  we primarily rely on excess operating cash flow from the previous tax season and our credit facility to fund our operating expenses and to reinvest in our business to support future growth 
given the nature of the franchise business model  our business is generally not capital intensive and has historically generated strong operating cash flow from operations on an annual basis 
credit facility on may   we amended our five year unsecured credit facility the amended and restated million credit facility to provide for additional flexibility in connection with the allowable maximum consolidated leverage ratio under the credit facility covenants 
borrowings under the million credit facility are to be used to finance working capital needs  general corporate purposes  potential acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock

we are restricted from repurchasing shares until we achieve a consolidated leverage ratio of or lower for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
thereafter  achievement of a consolidated leverage ratio of or below is required for continued share repurchases 
we are also limited to annual acquisitions of million when the consolidated leverage ratio  as defined  is greater than as of april   our consolidated leverage ratio  as defined  was furthermore  eurodollar borrowings will bear interest at libor plus a 
table of contents credit spread ranging from to per annum  base rate borrowings will bear interest at the prime rate plus a credit spread up to  and the annual fee now ranges from to of the unused portion of the credit facility 
in the future  we may require additional financing to meet our capital needs 
our liquidity position may be negatively affected by unfavorable conditions in the market in which we operate 
in addition  our inability to generate sufficient profits during tax season may unfavorably impact our funding requirements 
sources and uses of cash operating activities in fiscal  we received million less cash from operations as compared to fiscal due to the following lower franchise operations revenues of million primarily due to a decrease in the number of tax returns prepared by our network and lower financial product fees  higher costs of approximately million associated with incremental labor and facilities to support the new company owned offices opened during the past year  payments of million associated with the internal review primarily accrued in fiscal higher interest payments on our credit facility of million due to increased borrowings  and payment of million in severance primarily attributable to our former chief executive officer s departure from the company 
partially offsetting the factors discussed above were lower performance bonus payments as we paid million in fiscal accrued in fiscal as compared to million last year accrued in fiscal  and lower litigation settlement related payments of million accrued prior to fiscal 
in fiscal  we received million less cash from operations as compared to fiscal primarily due to the following higher income tax payments of million primarily due to the timing of estimated tax payments and the increase in operating income between years  higher performance bonus payments as we paid million in fiscal accrued in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal accrued in fiscal  higher litigation settlement related payments as we paid million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  and higher marketing and advertising payments primarily due to the reduction of million in our marketing and advertising constructive obligation accrued through april  partially offsetting the factors discussed above were the increase in net income of and the timing of payments received from franchisees

restructuring in fiscal  we will take steps to improve our cost structure and operating efficiency  which will include recognizing employee severance benefits associated with workforce reductions and contract termination costs to exit leases on underperforming offices 
marketing and advertising we receive marketing and advertising payments from franchisees to fund our budget for most of these expenses 
marketing and advertising expenses include national  regional 
table of contents and local campaigns designed to increase brand awareness and attract both early season and late season customers 
such expenses are seasonal in nature and typically increase in our third and fourth fiscal quarters when most of our revenues are earned 
we are making significant changes to our marketing effort for the tax season  with the overriding goal of bringing more new customers into our stores and improving our same store sales performance  profitability and customer retention 
company owned offices our company owned offices complement our franchise system and are focused primarily on organic growth through the opening of new company owned offices within existing territories as well as increasing office productivity 
we also continue to pursue selective acquisition opportunities for our company owned office segment in economically attractive  high growth markets adjacent to our current operations 
under the terms of the purchase agreements in connection with the october  acquisitions  the remaining balance of the purchase price  approximately million  is due in july furthermore  under the may amendment to our credit facility  we are limited to annual acquisitions of million when our consolidated leverage ratio  as defined  is greater than expenses to operate our company owned offices begin to increase during the third fiscal quarter and peak during the fourth fiscal quarter primarily due to the labor costs related to the seasonal employees who provide tax return preparation services to our customers 
capital expenditures we anticipate spending on capital expenditures in fiscal primarily for information technology upgrades to support our growth  which includes personnel related payments capitalized for the development of internal use software 
franchisee funding we anticipate providing franchisees with funding for conversions and to open new storefront offices as we look to build a stronger distribution system 
debt repayment as of may   we had million outstanding under our amended and restated million credit facility 
we anticipate generating operating cash flow next tax season to partially repay these outstanding borrowings 
quarterly dividend on june   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock  payable on july   to common stockholders of record on june  we currently intend to make quarterly cash dividend payments of per common share in fiscal future sources of cash we borrow against our credit facility to fund operations with increases particularly during the first nine months of the fiscal year 
beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter  we expect our primary source of cash to be cash provided by operating activities  primarily from the collection of accounts receivable from our franchisees and from the providers of financial products to our customers 
we plan to target and will seek to maintain a capital structure that is consistent with a low investment grade credit profile  broadly modeled in the bbb area 
we have no near term intention to seek a formal credit rating  and  given our size  we may have difficulty receiving an investment grade rating from the major rating agencies  however we use this profile for guidance 
we believe that targeting this capital structure profile over the long term will result in an appropriate balance between the needs of equity and debt providers  between financial risk and financial flexibility for our company  while providing a prudent use of leverage to minimize jackson hewitt s weighted average cost of capital 
as we assess our future dividend and share repurchase strategies  we plan to do so within the context of maintaining this targeted capital structure 
seasonality of operations given the seasonal nature of the tax return preparation business  we have historically generated and expect to continue to generate substantially all our revenues during the period from january through april in fiscal 
table of contents  we earned of our revenues during this period 
we historically operate at a loss through the first eight months of each fiscal year  during which we incur costs associated with preparing for the upcoming tax season 
additionally  the aggregate net loss in the off season period historically has increased period over period as a result of our prior year office expansion in the company owned segment  anticipated growth in the business and the cumulative effect of our share repurchase programs on interest expense

critical accounting policies in presenting our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our consolidated financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
the following critical accounting policies may affect reported results resulting in variations in our financial results both on an interim and fiscal year basis 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
we reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value 
when determining fair value  we utilized various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions would cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact results 
an adverse change to our business would impact our consolidated results and may result in an impairment of our goodwill 
the aggregate carrying value of our goodwill was million as of april  see part i 
item financial statements notes to consolidated financial statements note goodwill and other intangible assets for more information on goodwill 
other indefinite lived intangible assets we test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
indefinite lived intangible assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than 
table of contents the carrying amount  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
an adverse change to our business would impact our consolidated results and may result in an impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
the aggregate carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible assets was million as of april  see part i 
item financial statements notes to consolidated financial statements note goodwill and other intangible assets for more information on indefinite lived intangible assets 
long lived assets definite lived intangible assets and long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we test for impairment based on a comparison of the asset s undiscounted cash flows to its carrying value and  if impaired  written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values

 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which modifies and expands the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation and requires quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses on derivative instruments 
it also requires disclosures about credit related contingent features in derivative agreements 
sfas is effective for us beginning february  sfas encourages  but does not require  comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption 
the principal impact of sfas will be to require us to expand our disclosure regarding our derivative and hedging activities 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to convert a notional amount of million of floating rate borrowings into fixed rate debt  with the intention of mitigating the economic impact of changing interest rates 
under these interest rate swap agreements  the first million of which became effective in october and the remaining million in november  we receive a floating interest rate based on the three month libor in arrears and pay a fixed interest rate averaging from to 
these interest rate swap agreements were determined to be cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 
 no 
and no 
in connection with extending the maturity date under the amended and restated credit facility  in october we entered into interest rate collar agreements to become effective after the initial interest rate swap agreements terminate 
the interest rate collar agreements were entered into with financial institutions to limit the variability of expense payments on million of floating rate borrowings during the period from july to october to a range of the cap and the floor 
these interest rate collar agreements were determined to be cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended 
we have financial market risk exposure related primarily to changes in interest rates 
as discussed above  we attempt to reduce this risk through the utilization of derivative financial instruments 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate on our floating rate borrowings outstanding as of april   excluding our million of hedged borrowings whereby we fixed the interest rate  at an average ranging from to  would result in an annual increase or decrease in income before income taxes of million 
the estimated increase or decrease is based upon the level of variable rate debt as of april  and assumes no changes in the volume or composition of debt
