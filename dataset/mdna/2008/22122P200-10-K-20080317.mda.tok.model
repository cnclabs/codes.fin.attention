our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements below and elsewhere in this annual report

table of contents there are currently company owned and franchise premium convenience restaurants operating in states  the district of columbia  and the united arab emirates uae  of which eight franchised restaurants opened subsequent to fiscal  seven in the united states and one in the uae 
in addition  we closed one company owned restaurant in chicago subsequent to fiscal our restaurants offer innovative savory made to order products featuring our authentic hearth baked crackly crust signature cosi bread and fresh distinctive ingredients 
we maintain a pipeline of new menu offerings that are introduced seasonally through limited time offerings to keep our products relevant to our target customers 
our menu features high quality sandwiches  freshly tossed salads  cosi bagels  hot melts  flatbread pizzas  s mores and other desserts  and a variety of coffees along with other soft drink beverages  bottled beverages including premium still and sparkling water  teas  alcoholic beverages  and other specialty coffees 
our restaurants offer lunch and afternoon coffee in a counter service format  with most offering breakfast and or dinner and dessert menus as well 
we operate our company owned restaurants in two formats cosi and cosi downtown 
cosi downtown restaurants  which are located in nonresidential central business districts  close for the day in the early evening  while cosi restaurants offer dinner and dessert in a casual dining atmosphere 
we are currently eligible to offer franchises in states and the district of columbia 
we offer franchises to area developers and individual franchise operators 
the initial franchise fee  payable to us  for both an area developer and an individual franchise operator  is  for the first restaurant and  for each additional restaurant 
we believe that offering cosi franchised restaurants to area developers and individual franchisees offers the prospects of strong financial returns 
by franchising  we believe we will be able to increase the presence of our restaurants in various markets throughout the country and generate additional revenue without the large upfront capital commitments and risk associated with opening company owned restaurants 
as of december   we had secured franchise commitments from area developers for restaurants  for which we have received million in deposits  including restaurants existing as of the end of fiscal  and an international licensing agreement with a licensee in the persian gulf 
we are currently licensing the right to develop and operate cosi franchised restaurants in certain foreign jurisdictions in compliance with applicable local rules and regulations there 
we believe that incorporating a franchising and area developer model into our strategy will position us to maximize the market potential for the cosi brand and concept consistent with our available capital and we expect that company owned restaurants restaurants that we own as opposed to franchised restaurants will always be an important part of our new restaurant growth 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company reached an agreement with macy s inc macy s relating to the six cosi restaurants operated within macy s stores 
under the terms of the agreement  cosi ceased operations and closed those locations on august  macy s purchased the fixed assets and leasehold improvements at these locations for a total consideration of approximately million 
during fiscal  we opened six new company owned restaurants and permanently closed nine company owned restaurants  six that operated in the macy s department stores  one restaurant each in maryland and new jersey  and one restaurant in new york city that had an expiring lease and where we opened a new restaurant in the immediate vicinity subsequent to its closing 
cosi has reached an agreement in principle with a third party in the seattle  washington area to sell the assets of all three company owned locations currently operating there 
under the terms of the agreement  cosi will transfer rights to the assets and leasehold improvements for minimal cash consideration and the purchaser will assume the tenant obligations under the real estate operating leases and operate these locations under a different brand 
the assets at these locations have been previously impaired in their entirety and we do not anticipate that we will realize any gain from this transaction 
cosi expects to exit these locations by the end of the second quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires the appropriate application of certain accounting 
table of contents policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable and generally accepted for companies in the restaurant industry 
we believe that the following addresses the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires management judgments regarding the future operating and disposition plans for marginally performing assets  and estimates of expected realizable values for assets to be sold 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the application of sfas has affected the amount and timing of charges to operating results that have been significant in recent years 
we evaluate possible impairment at the individual restaurant level whenever we determine impairment factors are present and at least annually 
we consider a history of poor financial operating performance to be the primary indicator of potential impairment for individual restaurant locations 
we determine whether a restaurant location is impaired based on expected undiscounted cash flows  generally for the remainder of the lease term  and then determine the impairment charge based on discounted cash flows for the same period 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million of which million is related to the closed macy s locations and the locations in seattle  washington which are classified as discontinued operations  and million related to underperforming locations including one restaurant in chicago that was closed during the first quarter of fiscal lease termination charges statement for financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred  rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
for all exit activities  we estimate our likely liability under contractual leases for restaurants that have been closed 
such estimates have affected the amount and timing of charges to operating results and are impacted by management s judgments about the time it may take to find a suitable subtenant or assignee  or the terms under which a termination of the lease agreement may be negotiated with the landlord 
during fiscal  we recorded lease termination charges of approximately million related to a location where  due to the enforcement of restrictions in a zoning overlay district  cosi was denied the necessary permits to build a restaurant and we exercised the exit provision under the lease and to an underperforming restaurant in chicago were we exercised the early exit provision of the lease 
stock based compensation as of january   we have adopted the fair value recognition provision of sfas r  share based payment  which generally requires  among other things  that all employee share based compensation be measured using the fair value method and that all of the resulting compensation cost be recognized in the financial statements 
we selected the modified prospective method of adoption 
under sfas r  our stock compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is the vesting term 
we measure the estimated fair value of our granted stock options using a black scholes pricing model and of our restricted stock based on the fair market value of a share of registered stock on the date of the grant 
the operating results for fiscal years and reflect the adoption of sfas r 
accounting for lease obligations in accordance with financial accounting standards board technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term commencing on the date we take possession 
we include any rent escalations  rent abatements during construction periods and other rent holidays in our straight line rent calculation 
landlord allowances in accordance with financial accounting standards board technical bulleting fasb no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases  we record landlord allowances as deferred rent in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amortize them on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 

table of contents income taxes we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards 
our determination of the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the net operating loss carry forward  based on the company s operating results 
a positive adjustment to income will be recorded in future years if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize these deferred tax assets 
we have adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin as of january  fin prescribes a comprehensive financial statement model of how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns 
fin requires that only income tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold be recognized or continue to be recognized on the effective date 
initial recognition amounts would be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
no adjustment was made to the beginning retained earnings balance  as the ultimate deductibility of all tax positions is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility 
no interest or penalties have been accrued relative to tax positions due to the company having either a tax loss or net operating loss carry forwards to offset any taxable income in all subject years 
as a result  no liability for uncertain tax positions was recorded as of december  should the company need to accrue interest or penalties on uncertain tax positions  it would recognize the interest as interest expense and the penalties as a general and administrative expense

our company owned restaurant sales are composed almost entirely of food and beverage sales 
we record revenue at the time of the purchase of our products by our customers 
franchise fees and royalties

we recognize the franchise fee in the period in which each franchise location opens 
we recognize franchise royalties in the period in which sales are made by our franchise operators 
gift card sales 
we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase gift cards at our restaurants and through our website 
customers can purchase these cards at varying dollar amounts 
at the time of purchase by the customer  we record a gift card liability for the face value of the card purchased 
we recognize the revenue and reduce the gift card liability when the gift card is redeemed 
we do not reduce our recorded liability for potential non use of purchased gift cards 
comparable restaurant sales in calculating comparable restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for full months

the increase in restaurant labor and related benefits as a percentage of restaurant net sales during fiscal is due primarily to higher labor costs as a percentage of restaurant net sales in new restaurants opened since the second quarter of fiscal that have not yet reached maximum sales or operating efficiency and a slight deleveraging of labor costs against a relatively flat sales performance at comparable locations during fiscal as compared to fiscal occupancy and other restaurant operating expenses as a of restaurant net in thousands sales fiscal fiscal occupancy and other restaurant operating expenses the increase in restaurant occupancy and other restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant net sales during fiscal is due primarily to the impact of fixed occupancy costs against sales at new restaurants that have not yet reached expected sales levels  higher costs for repairs and maintenance  the impact of relatively flat sales performance at comparable locations on occupancy costs  and slightly higher costs for paper and packaging

for fiscal  we expect to open a limited number of new company owned restaurants 
we currently have two signed leases of which one is currently under construction and expected to open during the second quarter of fiscal we estimate the cost to open each company owned restaurant is approximately  net of landlord contributions and including pre opening expenses 
we do not expect to incur any significant remodeling capital costs during as we have already remodeled locations in varying degrees in the last months 
however  we do expect to incur capital maintenance costs on existing restaurants 
we expect to fund our new company owned restaurant construction costs and any required capital maintenance costs on existing locations from cash and cash equivalents on hand  expected cash flows generated by both existing and new company owned restaurants and expected franchise fees and royalties 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  and expected cash flows from company owned restaurant operations and franchise fees and royalties  will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for working capital needs in existing restaurant locations for the next twelve months 
in analyzing our cash outlays during fiscal 
table of contents  cash used in operations was million while cash used to fund capital expenditures was million 
we don not anticipate the same level of cash outlays for capital expenditures during fiscal in addition  during fiscal  we entered into franchise agreements with area developers which generated upfront franchising fees of approximately million 
we also believe that although cash and cash equivalent balances will decline slightly during the first quarter of due primarily to the impact of seasonality on operations we expect cash and cash equivalent levels to increase in subsequent quarters where we historically have more favorable seasonality 
however  if our existing and new company owned restaurants do not generate the cash flow levels that we expect  if we do not open new company owned and franchise restaurants according to our expectations  or if we do not generate the franchise fees and royalties that we currently expect  then we may need to reduce the number and or change the timing of new company owned restaurant openings  initiate further labor reductions in general and administrative support functions  seek to sell certain company owned locations to franchisees or other third parties or seek other sources of debt or equity funding

we have no derivative financial commodity instruments 
we invest our excess cash in investment grade  highly liquid  short term investments 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations

in fiscals and  interest income was million and million  respectively 
foreign currency risk as of fiscal  all of our transactions are conducted  and our accounts denominated  in us dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to foreign currency risk

some of our food costs are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices 
volatility in the commodity markets such as the wheat and dairy markets can have an adverse impact on our results from operations 
some of our hourly personnel at our restaurants are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage will directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
historically  inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operation
