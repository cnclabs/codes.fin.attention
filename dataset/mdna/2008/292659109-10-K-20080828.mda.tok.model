item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements 
overview we design  manufacture and sell photovoltaic pv products  known as pv or solar laminates  that generate clean  renewable energy by converting sunlight into electricity 
our solar laminates have unique characteristics that differentiate them from conventional crystalline solar modules  including physical flexibility  light weight  high durability and ease of installation 
these characteristics make our products particularly suitable for rooftop applications and building integrated bipv  which is our target market 
we manufacture our solar laminates using a proprietary process and technology that we developed through nearly years of research 
to meet the increasing demand for our products  we are actively expanding our production capacity and have embarked on an expansion plan to reach gw of annual production capacity by solar laminate sales represent more than of our revenues 
we also receive fees and royalties from licensees of our nickel metal hydride nimh battery technology and sell high performance nickel hydroxide used in nimh batteries 
our business segments we operate our business in two business segments united solar ovonic and ovonic materials 
financial information regarding each segment is available in note p  business segments  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
united solar ovonic our united solar ovonic segment designs  manufactures and sells pv laminates that generate clean  renewable energy by converting sunlight into electricity 
this business  which we conduct through our wholly owned subsidiary  united solar ovonic llc  is based principally on our pioneering technologies for thin film amorphous silicon pv laminates and low cost  roll to roll manufacturing 
our pv laminates possess several unique attributes that make them ideal for both rooftop and building integrated applications  including ability to be integrated with roofing materials  ability to qualify for special bipv incentives  light weight  superior resistance to wind uplift  no roof penetration  high durability and impact resistance  and ease of installation 
in addition  our products 
table of contents generate more electricity in real world conditions than many competing products  resulting in higher returns for our customers 
we sell our pv laminates principally for commercial and industrial roofing applications 
we believe that we have a strategic competitive advantage because our pv laminates are readily adaptable for integration into various roofing materials 
we sell most of our laminates to commercial roofing materials manufacturers  builders and building contractors  and solar power installers integrators who incorporate our pv laminates into their products for commercial sale and then handle all aspects of the consumer relationship  including marketing  sales and service 
we have embarked on an expansion plan to reach gw of production capacity by we believe this expansion is necessary to accommodate the rapidly growing demand for our products and to align with our customers needs 
we currently operate four manufacturing lines in michigan  two in auburn hills and two in greenville  totaling mw of nameplate capacity 
we are installing additional manufacturing lines in greenville  michigan that will bring our nameplate capacity to mw 
we expect these lines to be operating at full capacity before the end of fiscal year we manufacture our pv laminates using our proprietary vacuum deposition and large scale  roll to roll manufacturing processes to deposit amorphous silicon as a thin film on a large roll of stainless steel 
we design  develop and manufacture and have made the automated production equipment based on these proprietary process technologies 
we believe our manufacturing process and product design create significant barriers to entry for competitors who may seek to produce products similar to our own 
we also believe that consolidating our pv equipment design and manufacturing activities with our pv laminate manufacturing activities allows us to more effectively improve our manufacturing efficiency and reduce capital costs 
we compete with companies that currently manufacture and distribute products based on well established technologies for electricity generation  as well as companies that currently manufacture and distribute products based on alternative energy generation technologies  such as solar and wind 
our principal competitors in the solar market include sharp corporation  q cells ag  evergreen solar  inc  kyocera corporation  sanyo electric co  ltd 
sanyo  sunpower corp  mitsubishi electric corporation and suntech power holdings co  ltd  all of which manufacture predominantly crystalline or polycrystalline silicon pv modules  and first solar  inc  which manufactures thin film  cadmium telluride pv modules on glass substrates 
the competitiveness of alternative energy generation products in general  including solar power products  is typically enhanced by governmental incentives designed to encourage the use of these products as compared to conventional energy generation sources  which today are less expensive at the customer level in most locations 
however  our long term goal is to compete directly  without subsidies  in energy markets 
historically  we entered into long term supply agreements with certain of our customers that did not contain minimum firm purchase commitments 
these orders were completed on a current basis via purchase orders issued by the customers as they required our pv products 
therefore  our backlog of customer orders was not significant nor was it a meaningful indicator of future product sales 
in order to increase visibility and certainty  and to plan our operations more efficiently  we have recently focused our efforts on long term take or pay agreements that require 
table of contents the customer to purchase a specified minimum amount of our products 
we have increased  and will continue to increase  the percentage for our products that are sold under take or pay agreements as we continue to pursue our strategy of demand driven expansion 
therefore  our backlog of orders for pv products has increased as we have entered into more take or pay agreements 
as of june   our backlog of anticipated product sales for fiscal years through was approximately billion 
the company s estimate of anticipated product sales may be impacted by various assumptions  including price reductions  currency exchange rates and overall customer demand 
anticipated product sales include future firm commitments under take or pay agreements  confirmed orders from customers as of june  and government contracts 
our strategic customers include solar integrated technologies inc sit  biohaus pv handels gmbh biohaus  alwitra flachdach systeme gmbh  corus bausysteme gmbh  hoesch contecna systembau  unimetal spa  sunedison  llc  advanced green technologies  inc a unit of advanced roofing  inc and centrosolar ag 
sales to sit represented  and  respectively  of our product sales in this segment for fiscal years  and sales to biohaus were not significant for and represented of our product sales in this segment for each of fiscal years and sales to advanced green technologies represented of our product sales for fiscal year for information about our revenues by geographic region  see note p  business segments  to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our long term research and development strategy involves reducing production costs  improving light to electricity conversion efficiency and identifying new commercial applications for our products 
we seek to offset our research and development costs in this segment with third party funding  including product development agreements and government funding 
for example  in july we entered into a three year cooperative agreement in which we will receive approximately million from the department of energy under an innovative  new program  the solar america initiative  to increase the efficiency of our photovoltaic products  lower material costs and develop innovative installation methods in order to reduce overall system costs 
the key raw materials used in our united solar ovonic segment business are stainless steel  high purity industrial gases  primarily argon  nitrogen  hydrogen  silane and germane  and polymer materials 
we believe that we have adequate sources for the supply of key raw materials and components for our pv laminate manufacturing needs 
we have  in certain instances  selected single source suppliers for certain key raw materials and components for efficiency  cost and quality 
the cost of certain raw materials  in particular stainless steel and resin based polymer materials  has risen over the last several years  and we are actively managing these costs through purchasing strategies and product design and operating improvements 
our operations are not impacted by the current shortage of polysilicon a key raw material for conventional pv products that is affecting most of our competitors through higher costs and limited availability 
our united solar ovonic segment is headquartered in auburn hills  michigan  and has manufacturing facilities in auburn hills and greenville  michigan and tijuana  mexico 
we maintain sales offices in germany  italy and the united states

sales to gold peak industries represented  and  respectively  of our nimh materials product sales and  and  respectively  of our total revenues in this segment for the fiscal years ended june  
table of contents  and we conduct our manufacturing operations at an automated facility in troy  michigan 
the key raw materials used in our nickel hydroxide business are primarily nickel and cobalt 
all of the raw materials used are generally readily available from numerous sources  but interruptions in production or delivery of key raw materials could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operations in this segment 
prices for these raw materials may fluctuate in the normal course of business due to supply and demand 
our product pricing formula to our customers is based on the raw material price 
emerging technologies our research and development activities have generated new technologies  which we are seeking to bring to full scale commercialization 
these technologies  some of which are discussed below  are subject to further development and will require substantial additional funding to reach commercial product status 
we seek to offset our funding requirements by obtaining third party funding through strategic alliances and government contracts 
ovonic solid hydrogen storage technologies 
hydrogen is a clean and efficient fuel source that yields more energy per unit of weight than any other combustible fuel  and we are developing a practical approach to storing hydrogen in a solid metal matrix at low pressures using a family of efficient metal hydrides 
our solid hydrogen storage solutions have several advantages over conventional gaseous and liquid storage solutions  including improved weight and volumetric density and greater safety due to our technology s low pressure refilling and storage capabilities 
we are presently manufacturing pre production volumes of portable hydrogen canisters in rochester hills  michigan  and have sold over  canisters of various sizes to multiple customers since fiscal ovonic metal hydride fuel cell technologies 
fuel cells are environmentally clean power generators in which hydrogen and oxygen are combined to produce electricity  with water and heat as the only byproducts 
our ovonic metal hydride fuel cell technology is a proprietary approach that combines the best features of both fuel cell and battery technologies for a new  lower cost solution in comparison to conventional proton exchange membrane pem fuel cells  which require expensive platinum catalysts 
as part of our development activities  we have demonstrated high power fuel stacks utilizing our metal hydride fuel cell technology that meet the power ratings of certain commercially available fuel cells for the stationary market at a fraction of the cost 
ovonic biofuel reformation technologies 
the production of low cost hydrogen is a key for existing high volume hydrogen users and potential future uses 
our ovonic reformation technology produces pure hydrogen in a safe process from multiple biofuel and biomass sources at far lower operating temperatures than commercial processes without the generation of carbon dioxide gas 
our proprietary process uses inexpensive catalysts and has the potential to dramatically reduce hydrogen cost to the end user through local hydrogen production at the point of use  thereby eliminating transportation costs and risks 
we presently are seeking funding as we move from laboratory scale production to pilot plant demonstration 

table of contents our principal joint ventures we presently have two principal joint ventures that are commercializing technologies we invented cobasys  which is manufacturing and selling rechargeable nimh batteries primarily for transportation and stationary applications  and ovonyx  which is commercializing phase change memory devices through licensing arrangements and joint development agreements 
cobasys our cobasys joint venture designs  develops  manufactures and sells advanced nimh battery system solutions for transportation markets  including hybrid electric vehicles hevs  in addition to stationary back up power supply systems for uninterruptible power supply  telecommunication and distributed generation requirements 
cobasys presently manufactures and sells its advanced nimh battery system for several general motors corporation vehicles 
we have granted cobasys a royalty free  exclusive license to our nimh battery technology for certain applications  including vehicle propulsion and ancillary vehicle applications  telecommunications applications and uninterruptible power supply applications

cobasys is headquartered in orion township  michigan  and has a  square foot state of the art production facility with automated manufacturing equipment in springboro  ohio 
the manufacturing facility is iso ts  iso  iso and tl certified 
ovonyx our ovonyx joint venture is commercializing our proprietary ovonic universal memory oum technology through licensing and product development arrangements 
oum is a basic  
table of contents new type of nonvolatile memory that can replace conventional nonvolatile or flash memory in applications requiring retention of stored data when power is turned off  including cell phones  pdas  digital cameras and microelectronics 
oum  which is also known in the semiconductor industry as phase change random access memory pram and pc ram  offers several advantages over conventional nonvolatile memory  including significantly faster write time  greater scalability  lower power utilization and longer life  and is compatible with existing cmos manufacturing processes 
we own or on a fully diluted basis after giving effect to exercise of stock options and warrants of the common stock of ovonyx 
as part of this joint venture arrangement  we have licensed all oum technology to ovonyx on an exclusive  worldwide basis and contributed intellectual property  licenses  production processes and know how 
in addition to our equity interest in ovonyx  we receive of ovonyx annual gross revenue as a royalty 
ovonyx has entered into royalty bearing  nonexclusive license agreements with intel corporation  samsung electronics co  ltd  qimonda ag  elpida memory  inc  stmicroelectronics nv  bae systems and nanochip  inc to produce oum products 
under most of these agreements  ovonyx is also participating in joint development programs to assist in the commercialization of oum phase change memory products 
ovonyx has not yet realized any royalty revenues since its licensees have not begun commercial sales of products based on oum 
our technology and intellectual property the principal markets in which we compete the alternative energy generation  energy storage and information technology markets are characterized by rapid change and competition driven by technological and product performance advantages 
we have driven some of this activity through our pioneering and proprietary materials  product and production process technologies 
at the same time  we are actively engaged in product design and development to commercialize and improve our materials  products and production processes 
research and development expenditures our research and development expenditures are reflected as cost of revenues from product development agreements and product development and research expenses in our statements of operations in our consolidated financial statements 
we seek to offset our research and development costs with third party funding  including joint ventures  product development agreements and government funding 
competition since our businesses are based upon our pioneering technologies that offer fundamental solutions in the alternative energy generation  energy storage and information technology markets  we compete not only at the product level for market share but also at the technology level for market acceptance 
our competition includes well established conventional technologies  other alternative technology solutions and other technologies within an alternative solution 
for example  our pv technology competes with conventional electricity generation technologies  such as gas and 
table of contents coal  alternative electricity generation technologies  such as wind and nuclear  and other solar technologies  such as crystalline products 
our business competitors include some of the world s largest industrial companies  many of which are pursuing new technology solutions in addition to their well established conventional technologies 
we believe that we have derived a key business and technological advantage through our research and development activities by continuously inventing new technologies and improving our existing materials  products and production processes 
however  even as we successfully pursue these research and development activities  some of our technologies  particularly in the alternative energy generation and energy storage markets  presently face commercial barriers as compared to well established conventional technologies  including infrastructural barriers  customer transition costs and higher manufacturing costs associated with present production volumes 
the competitiveness of products based on our technologies in these areas is typically enhanced by external factors  including rising energy costs  concerns regarding energy security and governmental incentives at the customer level 
our long term goal is to compete directly in energy markets without subsidies 
patents and intellectual property we maintain an extensive patent portfolio presently consisting of over us patents and over foreign counterparts including patents assigned to a joint venture partner  to which we are regularly adding new patents based upon our continuing research and development activities 
importantly  our portfolio includes numerous basic and fundamental patents applicable to each of our business segments  covering not only materials  but also the production technology and products we develop 
based on the breadth and depth of our patent portfolio  we believe that our proprietary patent position is sustainable notwithstanding the expiration of certain patents 
we do not expect the expiration of any patents to materially affect the business prospects of any of our business segments 
our employees as of august   we and our consolidated subsidiaries had a total of  employees in the us and employees outside of the us these numbers do not include employees of our joint ventures or licensees

table of contents item a risk factors we have a history of losses and our future profitability is uncertain  the failure to maintain sustainable profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses 
principally as a result of ongoing operating losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of june  however  we generated net income of million for the year ended june   and our goal is to operate our business in such a way that such profitability is sustainable over the long term 
nonetheless  we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future  which in turn could materially and adversely impact our ability to repay the notes and could materially decrease the market value of our common stock and as a result  the value of our notes 
we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase as we seek to expand our manufacturing operations  whether domestically or internationally  service our debt obligations  develop our distribution network  continue to research and develop our products and manufacturing technologies  implement internal systems and infrastructure to support our growth  and retain key members of management  retain other personnel and hire additional personnel 
we do not know whether our revenue will grow at all or grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs  and our limited operating history under our current business strategy and new management team makes it difficult to assess the extent of these expenses or their impact on our operating results 
if we fail to sustain profitability  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we expect that we will need to make significant capital expenditures to increase our production capacity  and financing may be unavailable or available only on disadvantageous terms 
in the past  we have experienced substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and have required financing in order to pursue the commercialization of products based on our technologies 
we expect that we will continue to need financing to operate our business and for capital expenditures to expand our production capacity 
there can be no assurance that the proceeds from our recent convertible senior notes offering and concurrent equity offering will be sufficient to fund our manufacturing capacity in our united solar ovonic segment from the current mw to mw by and gw by if additional financing is necessary  there can be 
table of contents no assurance that such additional financing will be available or that the terms of such additional financing  if available  will be acceptable to us 
if additional financing is not available or not available on terms acceptable to us  our ability to fund our operations  develop and expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network  maintain our research and development efforts or otherwise respond to competitive pressures may be significantly impaired 
our expansion plans require significant engineering efforts  timely delivery of manufacturing equipment and dedicated management attention 
our future success depends  to a large extent  on our ability to expand our production capacity 
if we are unable to do so  we will not be able to attain the desired level of economies of scale in our operations or cut the marginal production cost to the level necessary to effectively maintain our pricing and other competitive advantages 
we expect that we will make substantial capital expenditures for our future growth 
this expansion has required  and will continue to require  significant engineering efforts  timely delivery of manufacturing equipment and dedicated management attention  and is subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including we may experience cost overruns  construction delays  equipment problems  including delays in manufacturing equipment deliveries or deliveries of equipment that is damaged or does not meet our specifications  and other operating difficulties  we will be required to obtain governmental approvals  permits or documents of similar nature with respect to any new expansion projects  but it is uncertain whether such approvals  permits or documents will be obtained in a timely manner or at all and  we may not have sufficient management resources to properly oversee capacity expansion as currently planned 
any of these or similar difficulties could significantly delay or otherwise constrain our ability to undertake our capacity expansion plans as currently planned  which in turn would limit our ability to increase sales  reduce marginal manufacturing costs or otherwise improve our prospects and profitability 
we rapidly are expanding our manufacturing capacity for solar energy products in order to meet expected demand  and our revenue and profits will depend upon our ability to successfully complete this expansion and then to sell our solar energy products at higher volumes to match our expanded capacity 
we plan to continue the expansion of our manufacturing capacity from the current nameplate capacity of mw to an expected nameplate capacity of mw by and reaching gw by this expansion plan includes adding new facilities in greenville  michigan  tijuana  mexico and tianjin  china and other locations to be determined 
we are designing  developing  manufacturing  installing and testing the equipment for this expansion internally and through third parties 
we may experience delays  additional or unexpected costs and other adverse events in connection with our capacity expansion projects  including those associated with the equipment we are providing 
for example  we source some of the equipment that we use in our manufacturing 
table of contents process from single source suppliers 
additionally  there can be no assurance that market demand will align with our expanding manufacturing capacity or that our marketing capabilities at the expanded manufacturing volumes will be successful 
as a result  we may not be able to realize revenue and profits based upon the expected additional capacity  or we may experience delays or reductions in these revenue and profits  and our business could be materially adversely affected 
we have international operations  which we are expanding  that are vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
we have a pv laminate manufacturing facility in tijuana  mexico  and have established a joint venture in tianjin  china  to manufacture pv laminates 
also  a portion of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
international operations and transactions are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad  including the potential that we may be forced to forfeit  voluntarily or involuntarily  foreign assets due to economic or political instability in the countries in which we choose to locate our manufacturing facilities  difficult and expensive compliance with the commercial and legal requirements of international markets  difficulty in interpreting and enforcing contracts governed by foreign law  which may be subject to multiple  conflicting and changing laws  regulations and tax systems  inability to obtain  maintain or enforce intellectual property rights  encountering trade barriers such as export requirements  tariffs  currency exchange controls  taxes and other restrictions and expenses  which could affect the competitive pricing of our solar laminates and reduce our market share in some countries  being subjected to additional withholding taxes or other tax on our foreign income or tariffs and other restrictions on foreign trade and investment  including currency exchange controls  being subjected to fluctuations in exchange rates which may affect product demand and may affect our profitability in us dollars to the extent the price of our solar laminates and cost of raw materials  labor and equipment is denominated in a foreign currency  limitations on dividends or restrictions against repatriation of earnings  difficulty in recruiting and retaining individuals skilled in international business operations  and increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts 

table of contents in addition  since expanding our business globally is an important element of our strategy  our exposure to these risks will be greater in the future 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 
however  any such occurrences could be harmful to our business and our profitability 
certain equipment purchases are denominated in foreign currency 
as noted above  we are planning on making substantial capital expenditures as part of our expansion plan 
a portion of the equipment associated with the expansion plan is purchased from a manufacturer in japan and the contracts are payable in yen 
as of june   we have commitments to purchase equipment totaling approximately billion yen million 
a substantial change in the exchange rate between the dollar and the yen between the time the contracts are entered into and the time payments on the equipment are due could adversely impact the cost of the equipment 
presently  we have entered into forward contracts for approximately million yen to mitigate the risk associated with changes in exchange rates between the dollar and the yen 
we face intense competition from other companies producing solar energy and other renewable energy products 
the solar energy market is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
the number of solar energy product manufacturers is rapidly increasing due to the growth of actual and forecast demand for solar energy products and the relatively low barriers to entry 
if we fail to attract and retain customers in our target markets for our current and future core products  namely solar laminates  we will be unable to increase our revenue and market share 
some of our competitors have established more prominent market positions  and if we fail to attract and retain customers and establish successful distribution networks in our target markets for our products  we will be unable to increase our sales 
our competitors include sharp corporation  q cells ag  evergreen solar  inc  kyocera corporation  sanyo electric co  ltd  sunpower corp  mitsubishi electric corporation and suntech power holdings co  ltd  all of which currently manufacture predominantly crystalline or polycrystalline silicon solar energy laminates  and first solar  inc  which currently manufactures thin film  cadmium telluride solar energy laminates on glass substrates 
we may also face competition from new entrants to the solar energy market  including those that offer more advanced technological solutions or that have greater financial resources 
a significant number of our competitors are developing or currently producing products based on more advanced solar energy technologies  including amorphous silicon  string ribbon and nano technologies  which may eventually offer cost advantages over the technologies currently used by us 
a widespread adoption of any of these technologies could result in a rapid decline in our position in the solar energy market and our revenue if we fail to adopt such technologies 
furthermore  the entire solar energy industry also faces competition from conventional energy and non solar renewable energy providers 
due to the relatively high manufacturing costs compared to most other energy sources  solar energy is generally not competitive without government incentive programs 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing and other resources than we do 
our competitors greater size in some cases 
table of contents provides them with a competitive advantage with respect to manufacturing costs because of their economies of scale and their ability to purchase raw materials at lower prices 
as a result  those competitors may have stronger bargaining power with their suppliers and may have an advantage over us in negotiating favorable pricing  as well as securing supplies in times of shortages 
many of our competitors also have greater brand name recognition  more established distribution networks and larger customer bases 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential distributors and have extensive knowledge of our target markets 
as a result  they may be able to devote more resources to the research  development  promotion and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions than we can 
our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
demand for our products may be adversely affected by the current economic and credit environment 
the united states and international economies recently have experienced and continue to experience a period of slow economic growth 
a near term economic recovery is uncertain 
in particular  the current credit and housing crises  the increase in us sub prime mortgage defaults  terrorist acts and similar events  continued turmoil in the middle east or war in general could contribute to a slowdown of the market demand for products that require significant initial capital expenditures  including demand for solar laminates and new residential and commercial buildings 
if the economic recovery slows down as a result of the recent economic  political and social turmoil  or if there are further terrorist attacks in the united states or elsewhere  we may experience decreases in the demand for our solar power products  which may harm our operating results 
for example  we have benefited from historically low interest rates that have made it more attractive for our customers to use credit to purchase our products 
interest rates have fluctuated recently  which could increase the cost of financing these purchases and may reduce our customers profits and investors expected returns on investment 
given the current credit environment  particularly the tightening of the credit markets  there can be no assurance that our customers will be able to borrow money on a timely basis or on reasonable terms  which could have a negative impact on their demand for our products 
our sales are affected by interest rate fluctuations and the availability of liquidity  and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates or liquidity constraints 
rising interest rates may also make certain alternative investments more attractive to investors  and therefore lead to a decline in demand for our solar products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
demand for our products is affected by existing regulations concerning the electrical utility industry  changes to such regulations may present technical  regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products  which may significantly reduce demand for our products 
the market for electricity generation products is influenced heavily by foreign  federal  state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry  as well as internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities 
these regulations and policies 
table of contents often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer owned electricity generation 
in the united states at both the national level and the state and local level and in a number of other countries  these regulations and policies are being modified and may continue to be modified 
customer purchases of  or further investment in the research and development of  alternative energy sources  including solar power technology  could be deterred by these regulations and policies  which could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our solar power products 
for example  utility companies commonly charge fees to larger  industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for back up purposes 
these fees could increase the cost to our customers of using our solar power products and make them less desirable  thereby harming our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
we anticipate that our solar power products and their installation will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national  state and local laws and ordinances relating to building codes  safety  environmental protection  utility interconnection and metering and related matters 
there is also a burden in having to track the requirements of individual countries and states and design equipment to comply with the varying standards 
any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar power products may result in significant additional expenses to us and our resellers and their customers and  as a result  could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar power products 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers 
we historically have entered into agreements with a relatively small number of major customers throughout the world 
our five largest customers represented approximately  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
any loss or material reduction in sales to any of our top customers  especially solar integrated technologies  inc  would be difficult to recoup from other customers and could have an adverse effect on our sales  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the reduction or elimination of government incentives related to solar power could cause our revenues to decline 
today  the cost of solar power exceeds the cost of power furnished by the electric utility grid in most locations 
as a result  federal  state and local government bodies in many countries  most notably germany  japan  italy  spain  france  greece and the united states  have provided incentives in the form of rebates  tax credits and other incentives to end users  distributors  system integrators and manufacturers of solar power products to promote the use of solar energy to reduce dependency on other forms of energy 
these government economic incentives could be reduced or eliminated 
reductions in  or eliminations or expirations of  incentives related to solar power could result in decreased demand for our solar laminates and lower our revenue 

table of contents we must continue to develop and market new and innovative products and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful 
our financial performance depends in part on our ability to enhance our existing solar laminates  develop new and innovative products and product applications  and adopt or develop new technologies that continue to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 
the continued demand for our solar laminates is premised in part on the features of our solar laminates that distinguish them from the solar laminates of our competitors and the resulting unique product applications 
these features included physical flexibility  the ability of our laminates to be integrated with roofing materials  light weight  superior resistance to wind lift  durability  no roof penetration and ease of installation 
there are companies using similar or competitive technologies that have introduced or announced plans to introduce solar laminates incorporating some or all of these features 
in addition  all solar laminates compete based on efficiency and significant advances in the efficiency of the solar laminates of our competitors also could provide them with a competitive advantage 
if we fail to enhance our existing solar laminates  develop new and innovative products and product applications  or adopt or develop new technologies that continue to differentiate our products from those of our competitors  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the expansion of our business into new markets  such as residential  may increase our exposure to certain risks  including class action claims 
we are developing new applications of our solar technology  including solar laminates to be integrated into residential roofing materials 
our new solar technology applications may not gain market acceptance and we may not otherwise be successful in entering new markets  including the market for residential applications 
moreover  entry into new markets may increase our exposure to certain risks that we currently face or expose us to new risks 
for example  the residential construction market for solar energy systems is exposed to different risks than the commercial construction markets  including more acute seasonality  sensitivity to interest rates and other macroeconomic conditions  as well as enhanced legal exposure 
in particular  new home developments can result in class action litigation when one or more homes in a development experience problems with roofing or power systems 
if we enter the residential market and experience product failures that create property damage or personal injury  we may be exposed to greater liability of a different nature than with respect to product failures in commercial building applications 
we have focused our business strategy on  and invested significant financial resources in  the bipv segment of the pv market and there is no guarantee that the demand for bipv systems will develop as we anticipate 
our current business strategy rests on increasing demand for bipv systems 
we believe that there has been an increase in demand for bipv systems based in part on increasing interest and customer support from the building industry  solar customers and governments 
as a result  we have invested  and will continue to invest  significant financial resources in the production and commercialization of our solar laminates for bipv systems 
if the bipv segment does not develop as we anticipate  or takes longer to develop than we anticipate  we may experience difficulties 
table of contents implementing our growth and business targets 
this in turn could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results from operations 
we may be unable to obtain key raw materials that meet our quality  quantity and cost requirements 
the key raw materials used in our business are stainless steel  resin based polymers  nickel and high purity industrial gases  primarily argon  nitrogen  hydrogen  silane and germane 
most of our key raw materials are readily available from numerous sources  however we have  in certain instances  selected single source suppliers for certain key raw materials and components for efficiency  cost and quality 
our supply chain and operations could be adversely impacted by the failure of the suppliers of the single sourced materials to provide us with the raw materials that meet our quality  quantity and cost requirements 
in addition  significant shortages or price increases in raw materials that are not single sourced may adversely impact our business 
for example  the operations of many of our competitors that produce conventional solar energy products have been adversely impacted by the current shortage of polysilicon a key raw material for conventional solar energy products  which has caused prices for those materials to rise and limited availability of materials for manufacturing needs 
similarly  the cost of certain raw materials  in particular stainless steel and resin based polymer materials  has risen over the last several years  which has impacted and may continue to impact our operations 
any constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our obligations under customer purchase orders  and any increase in the price of raw materials could constrain our margins  either of which would adversely impact our financial results 
we actively manage our raw materials and other supply costs through purchasing strategies and product design and operating improvements  however our management may not always be effective  which could adversely impact our supply chain and financial condition 
some of our suppliers may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we implement our planned increase in production capacity 
in such event  we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms 
raw materials and components from new suppliers also may be less suited for our technology and yield solar laminates with lower conversion efficiencies  higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar laminates manufactured with the raw materials from our current suppliers 
our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality  quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar laminates or increase our manufacturing cost 
significant warranty and product liability claims could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we may be subject to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our solar laminates fail to perform as expected or if a failure of our solar laminates results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury  property damage or other damages 
since our solar laminates are electricity producing devices  it is possible that our products could result in injury  whether by product malfunctions  defects  improper installation or other causes 
in addition  because the products we are developing incorporate new technologies and use new installation methods  we cannot predict whether or not product liability claims will be brought against us in the future or the effect of any 
table of contents resulting negative publicity on our business 
moreover  we may not have adequate resources in the event of a successful claim against us 
our current standard product warranty for our solar laminates includes a year warranty 
we believe our warranty periods are competitive with industry practice 
due to the long warranty period and our proprietary technology  we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have shipped product and recognized revenue 
although we test our solar power products for reliability and durability  we cannot ensure that we effectively simulate the year warranty period 
any increase in the defect rate of our products would cause us to increase the amount of warranty reserves and have a corresponding negative impact on our results 
a successful warranty or product liability claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages 
in addition  quality issues can have various other ramifications  including delays in the recognition of revenue  loss of revenue  loss of future sales opportunities  increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products  and a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation 
the possibility of future product failures could cause us to incur substantial expenses to repair or replace defective products 
furthermore  widespread product failures may damage our market reputation and reduce our market share and cause sales to decline 
the conversion rate of our outstanding convertible debt is dependent upon the trading price of our common stock and thus the dilutive impact of the future converted shares cannot be predicted 
except in the instance of specific events such as the sale of all of our assets or us being acquired by another company  the debt is not convertible until march  the conversion rate of our convertible debt is dependent upon the trading price of our common stock for a period of trading days prior to the conversion 
since we cannot predict the future trading price of our common stock  we cannot estimate the number of shares that will be issued at the time of conversion and the effect of those shares on the trading price of the common stock or the effect on earnings per share 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 
our efforts to transform from a multi faceted research and development company to a solar power focused commercial enterprise is being led by our recently reorganized management team  including mark morelli  joseph conroy  mike fetcenko  subhendu guha  jay knoll  arthur rogers  marcelino susas  tom toner and corby whitaker 
our success is highly dependent on the continued services of these individuals and of a limited number of skilled managers  scientists and technicians 
the loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  our success will depend upon  among other factors  the recruitment and retention of additional highly skilled and experienced management and technical personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing employees or to attract and retain additional personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel in industrial  academic and nonprofit research sectors 

table of contents we may become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings which may reach unfavorable resolutions 
we are involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
due to the inherent uncertainties of legal proceedings  the outcome of any such proceeding could be unfavorable  and we may choose to make payments or enter into other arrangements  to settle such proceedings 
failure to settle such proceedings could require us to pay damages or other expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have been subject to legal proceedings in the past involving the validity and enforceability of certain of our patents 
while such patent related legal proceedings have been resolved  such proceedings can require the expenditure of substantial management time and financial resources and can adversely affect our financial performance 
there can be no assurance that we will not be a party to other legal proceedings in the future 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or other hazardous chemicals 
although we believe that we are in compliance with these laws  rules and regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
third parties may also have the right to sue to enforce compliance 
moreover  it is possible that increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder could require us to make significant capital expenditures 
the operation of a manufacturing plant entails the inherent risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the handling of potentially harmful substances 
there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs and liabilities in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
in addition  we generate hazardous materials and other wastes that are disposed of at licensed disposal facilities 
we may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these facilities in the event of a release of hazardous substances by such facilities into the environment 
our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology including our trade secrets and other confidential information 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for products based on our technologies 
our policy is to seek to protect our products and technologies by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements 
the patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
our ability to maintain our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted 
we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents 
our issued patents and those that we may issue in the future may be challenged  invalidated  rendered unenforceable or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products and technologies 
in addition  the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive 
table of contents advantages against competitors with similar products or technologies 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate technology developed by us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property 
because of the extensive time required for development and commercialization of products based on our technologies  it is possible that  before these products can be commercialized  any related patents may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization  thereby reducing any advantages of these patents and making it unlikely that we will be able to recover investments we have made to develop our technologies and products based on our technologies 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on protection of trade secrets  know how and confidential and proprietary information 
to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information  we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees  agents and consultants upon the commencement of their relationships with us 
these agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties 
our agreements with employees also provide that inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property 
individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms 
in the event of the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information  these agreements  even if obtained  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information 
to the extent that our employees or consultants use technology or know how owned by others in their work for us  disputes may arise as to the rights in related inventions 
adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information 
the disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents  which could be expensive and time consuming 
competitors may infringe our patents 
to counter infringement or unauthorized use  we may be required to file patent infringement claims  which can be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  in an infringement proceeding  a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable  or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
interference proceedings brought by the united states patent and trademark office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications 
litigation or interference proceedings may fail and  even if successful  may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management 
we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the united states 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be 
table of contents compromised by disclosure 
in addition  during the course of this litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we may not prevail in any litigation or interference proceeding in which we are involved 
even if we do prevail  these proceedings can be expensive and distract our management 
third parties may own or control patents or patent applications that are infringed by our products or technologies 
our success depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties patents and proprietary rights 
in the united states and most other countries  patent applications are published months after filing 
as a result  there may be patents of which we are unaware  and avoiding patent infringement may be difficult 
we may inadvertently infringe third party patents or patent applications 
these third parties could bring claims against us that  even if resolved in our favor  could cause us to incur substantial expenses and  if resolved against us  could additionally cause us to pay substantial damages 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against us  we and our joint venture partners and licensees could be forced to stop or delay research  development  manufacturing or sales of products based on our technologies in the country or countries covered by the patent we infringe  unless we can obtain a license from the patent holder 
such a license may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  particularly if the third party is developing or marketing a product competitive with products based on our technologies 
even if we were able to obtain a license  the rights may be nonexclusive  which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
we also may be required to pay substantial damages to the patent holder in the event of an infringement 
under some circumstances in the united states  these damages could be triple the actual damages the patent holder incurs 
if we have supplied infringing products to third parties for marketing or licensed third parties to manufacture  use or market infringing products  we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for any damages they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses the third parties may sustain themselves as the result of lost sales or damages paid to the patent holder 
any successful infringement action brought against us may also adversely affect marketing of products based on our technologies in other markets not covered by the infringement action 
furthermore  we may suffer adverse consequences from a successful infringement action against us even if the action is subsequently reversed on appeal  nullified through another action or resolved by settlement with the patent holder 
the damages or other remedies awarded  if any  may be significant 
as a result  any infringement action against us would likely harm our competitive position  be costly and require significant time and attention of our key management and technical personnel 

table of contents compliance with environmental regulations can be expensive  and noncompliance with these regulations may require us to pay substantial fines  suspend production or cease operations 
the operation of our manufacturing facilities entails the use and handling of potentially harmful substances  including toxic and explosive gases that pose inherent risks of environmental damage or personal injury 
although we believe that we are in material compliance with environmental regulations  rules and regulations  there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs and liabilities in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
we may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these facilities in the event of a release of hazardous substances into the environment by our operations 
for example  our manufacturing process involves the controlled storage and use of silane and germane  both of which are toxic and combustible 
although we have rigorous safety procedures for handling these materials  the risk of accidental injury from such hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated 
if we have an accident at one of our facilities involving a release of these substances  we may be subject to civil and or criminal penalties  including financial penalties and damages  and possibly injunctions preventing us from continuing our operations 
in addition  it is possible that increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures 
to date such laws and regulations have not had a significant impact on our operations  and we believe that we have all necessary permits to conduct operations as they are presently conducted 
if more stringent laws and regulations are adopted in the future  the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations could be substantial 
the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines  third party lawsuits  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
our cobasys affiliate faces uncertain prospects and is the subject of a pending arbitration the outcome of which is uncertain but may expose us to material liability if not settled or resolved favorably 
cobasys  our joint venture formed to commercialize our nimh battery technology  has generated losses since its formation 
cobasys had losses of approximately million and obtained funding of approximately million in  and in january cobasys management forecast losses of approximately million and funding requirements of approximately million for the two members of cobasys obc and ctv have not approved a business plan and budget nor been able to agree on a solution to cobasys business issues or whether cobasys should continue as a going concern if it cannot be sold in the near future 
until september  ctv historically funded cobasys loss generating operations through the purchase of preferred interests cumulating in excess of million 
from october through january  ctv declined to purchase preferred interests and funded cobasys in a manner that in our view violated the december  agreement among us  obc and ctv that governs cobasys the operating agreement and applicable michigan law 
since february  cobasys has received funding support from a customer in the form of a loan for capital equipment purchases and a price increase on products sold to the customer 
there is no assurance that this customer funding support will 
table of contents continue on these or other terms  what the future funding requirements may be or that the support  if provided  will otherwise be sufficient to permit cobasys to continue as a going concern 
on september   ctv issued a notice of dispute and filed claims in arbitration against us and obc relating to cobasys 
ctv s original arbitration claim asserted damages in the amount of million and sought injunctive and other relief and alleged that we and obc breached and anticipatorily repudiated obligations to provide certain funding to cobasys under the operating agreement 
ctv subsequently filed a supplemental notice of dispute amending its claims to assert that we and obc had dishonored ctv s preferred interest in cobasys and that obc had breached its obligation to use diligent efforts to approve a annual budget for cobasys 
at a hearing on january   ctv requested that the arbitrator declare that we and obc be obligated to fund our share of cobasys necessary costs and expenses through capital contributions favored by ctv but opposed by obc 
we and obc requested that the arbitrator declare that under the operating agreement neither cobasys member is required to make any capital contribution absent a unanimously approved annual budget and an agreement by the members that a capital contribution must be made 
since the operating costs and expenses of cobasys are uncertain  we are unable to assess the magnitude of our liability if ctv s request is granted  however such liability could be material 
however  prior to any ruling by the arbitrator on these competing claims  the parties suspended the arbitration pursuant to an interim settlement agreement among us  obc and ctv in order to pursue the potential sale of cobasys to a third party 
sale negotiations have been ongoing during which the parties to the arbitration have repeatedly amended the interim settlement agreement to extend the deadline for timely consummation 
there is no assurance that the sale will be completed by september   the current deadline  and  if not completed  that the parties will again extend the interim settlement agreement 
if the sale of cobasys does not close by that date and any of we  obc or ctv determine not to further extend our interim settlement agreement  we  obc or ctv could resume the arbitration and receive a ruling from the arbitrator 
we cannot assure you that a sale will be timely consummated or consummated at all 
if not timely consummated and the arbitration is resumed  we cannot assure you that we and obc would prevail or otherwise avoid material liability 
we have entered into joint ventures and licensing agreements to develop and commercialize products based on our technologies and we must manage such joint ventures and licensing agreements successfully 
we have entered into licensing and joint venture agreements in order to develop and commercialize certain products based on our technologies 
any revenue or profits that may be derived by us from these agreements will be substantially dependent upon our ability to agree with our joint venture partners and licensees about the management and operation of the joint ventures and license agreements 
in addition  any revenue or profits from such agreements will be substantially dependent on the willingness and ability of our joint venture partners and licensees to devote their financial resources and manufacturing and marketing capabilities to commercialize products based on our technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will agree regarding the operation of such joint ventures and licensing agreements  that required financial resources will be available on mutually agreeable terms or that commercialization efforts will be successful 
if we and our joint venture partners and licensees are unable to agree with respect to the operation of our joint ventures and licensing agreements  are unwilling or unable to devote financial resources or are 
table of contents unable to commercialize products based on our technologies  we may not be able to realize revenue and profits based on our technologies and our business could be materially adversely affected 
our government product development and research contracts may be terminated by unilateral government action  or we may be unsuccessful in obtaining new government contracts to replace those that have been terminated or completed 
we have several government product development and research contracts 
any revenue or profits that may be derived by us from these contracts will be substantially dependent upon the government agencies willingness to continue to devote their financial resources to our research and development efforts 
there can be no assurance that such financial resources will be available or that such research and development efforts will be successful 
our government contracts may be terminated for the convenience of the government at any time  even if we have fully performed our obligations under the contracts 
upon a termination for convenience  we would generally only be entitled to recover certain eligible costs and expenses we had incurred prior to termination and would not be entitled to any other payments or damages 
therefore  if government product development and research contracts are terminated or completed and we are unsuccessful in obtaining replacement government contracts  our revenue and profits may decline and our business may be adversely affected 
the credit facility entered into by our subsidiaries  united solar ovonic corporation and united solar ovonic llc  contains covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 
we conduct substantially all of our united solar ovonic segment operations through our subsidiaries united solar ovonic corporation and united solar ovonic llc 
for example  our cash flows from that segment are dependent on the distributions to us by united solar ovonic corporation and united solar ovonic llc 
in february  united solar ovonic corporation and united solar ovonic llc entered into a secured credit facility with an aggregate commitment of up to million  of which we are a guarantor 
the credit facility contains  and any other future debt agreements may contain  covenant restrictions that may effectively limit our ability to operate our business  due to restrictions on our or our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees  create liens  make certain investments  enter into transactions with our affiliates  sell certain assets  make certain restricted payments  
table of contents declare or pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders  and merge or consolidate with any person 
as a result of these covenants  our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be significantly restricted  and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us due to the restrictions imposed by the credit facility 
in addition  the failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default  which could permit the lenders and debtholders to accelerate such debt 
we have a significant amount of debt outstanding 
our indebtedness  along with our other contractual commitments  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as our ability to meet any of our payment obligations 
together with our subsidiaries  we have a significant amount of debt and debt service requirements 
as of june   we have approximately million of outstanding debt 
this level of debt and related debt service could have significant consequences on our future operations  including making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations  resulting in an event of default if we and our subsidiaries fail to comply with covenants contained in our debt agreements  which could result in such debt becoming immediately due and payable  reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes  subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates  including borrowings under our new credit facility  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  and increasing our vulnerability to  changes in our business  the industry in which we operate and the general economy  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged 
any of the above listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations 
our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations  or that 
table of contents future borrowings will be available to us under existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise  in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations  we may need to refinance or restructure our debt  sell assets  reduce or delay capital investments  or seek to raise additional capital 
if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives  we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under our debt and other obligations

item legal proceedings cobasys 
on september   ctv issued a notice of dispute and filed claims in arbitration against ecd and obc relating to our cobasys joint venture 
ctv s original arbitration claim seeks damages and injunctive and other relief and alleges that ecd and obc breached and anticipatorily repudiated obligations to provide certain funding to cobasys under the amended and restated operating agreement dated as of december  among us  obc and ctv the operating agreement  which governs cobasys 
ctv subsequently filed a supplemental notice of dispute amending its claims to assert that ecd and obc had dishonored ctv s preferred interest in cobasys and that obc had breached its obligation to use diligent efforts to approve a annual budget for cobasys 
we and obc have denied ctv s allegations and filed a counterclaim  seeking damages and injunctive and other relief on the ground that ctv has been acting 
table of contents unilaterally and in violation of the operating agreement and applicable michigan law in regard to the funding and spending provisions of the agreement 
we and obc dispute and have been vigorously defending the claims asserted by ctv and have pursued our counterclaim 
in our view  the operating agreement is clear that we and obc have no present obligation to provide funding to cobasys  obc is not in default of the operating agreement  any future funding obligation would arise only upon unanimous approval by cobasys members  obc and ctv  of i a budget and operating plan for cobasys  and ii agreed capital contributions by the members  and ctv has no right unilaterally to provide funding or to authorize spending by cobasys without an approved budget and operating plan  or otherwise as approved by obc 
in our view  the operating agreement is also clear that we and obc have not dishonored ctv s preferred interests  obc has an unqualified right to refuse to sell its interests in cobasys on terms that it does not consider appropriate  and obc may determine in its discretion whether to approve any sale of cobasys or sale of ctv s interests in cobasys 
the members of cobasys have not approved a business plan and budget  and ctv and obc have not been able to agree on a solution to cobasys business issues or whether cobasys should continue as a going concern if it cannot be sold in the near future 
cobasys had losses of approximately million and obtained funding of approximately million in  and in january cobasys management forecast losses of approximately million and funding requirements of approximately million for until september  ctv historically funded cobasys loss generating operations through the purchase of preferred interests 
from october through january  ctv declined to purchase preferred interests and funded cobasys in a manner that in obc s view violated the operating agreement and applicable michigan law 
since february  cobasys has received funding support from a customer in the form of a loan for capital equipment purchases and a price increase on products sold to the customer 
while cobasys has been receiving this funding support from its customer  cobasys management has not sought any funding from the members of cobasys 
there is no assurance that this customer funding support will continue on these or other terms or otherwise be sufficient to permit cobasys to continue as a going concern 
since february  the arbitration has been suspended pursuant to an interim settlement agreement among us  obc and ctv in order to pursue the potential sale of cobasys to a third party 
sale negotiations have been ongoing during which the parties to the arbitration have repeatedly amended the interim settlement agreement to extend the deadline for timely consummation of the sale 
there is no assurance that the sale will be completed by september   the current deadline  and  if not completed  that the parties will again extend the interim settlement agreement

solar laminate sales represent more than of our revenues 
we also receive fees and royalties from licensees of our nickel metal hydride nimh battery technology and sell high performance nickel hydroxide used in nimh batteries 
the following key factors should be considered when reviewing our results for the periods discussed our consolidated financial results are driven primarily by the performance of our united solar segment 
our united solar segment accounted for and of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
our united solar segment generated operating income of million and million in the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
given the expected growth of this segment as discussed below relative to our other business activities  our overall success in the foreseeable future will be aligned primarily with the performance of our united solar segment and subject to the risks of that business 
we are expanding our manufacturing capacity in our united solar segment to meet growing demand 
we increased our manufacturing capacity by in fiscal as compared to fiscal to the current nameplate capacity of mw 
we are adding mw of nameplate capacity in the first half of fiscal as we continue our expansion to mw of nameplate capacity of and gw by we intend to fund this expansion using cash flow from operations and the funds generated from the offering of our convertible notes and common stock  which was completed in fiscal we are enhancing our revenues in our united solar segment through a demand driven expansion strategy  which includes increasing our sales of solar laminates from take or pay agreements and focusing on customers and markets where our solar laminates have a competitive advantage  particularly the building integrated photovoltaic bipv market 
we increased our product sales in our united solar segment by in fiscal as compared to fiscal to million 
these sales were generally consummated under supply agreements with our customers that established an overall framework for supplying our solar laminates but did not include minimum purchase requirements 
in order to increase visibility and certainty  and to plan our operations accordingly  we have recently focused our efforts on long term take or pay agreements that require the customer to 
table of contents purchase a specified minimum amount of our products 
at the same time  we are concentrating on the bipv market 
the physical flexibility  durability and lightweight nature of our solar laminates makes them an attractive value proposition for the bipv market  particularly commercial rooftop applications  where our solar laminates can be integrated with roofing materials and other building products 
we believe the bipv market  including commercial roof top applications  represents the most attractive opportunity for our solar laminates and we believe we will continue to increase our sales within this market 
we are improving the profitability of our united solar segment by aggressively reducing the costs and improving the efficiency of our products  which is being partially offset by the impact of ramping our new manufacturing capacity 
we increased our gross profit margin in our united solar segment by in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
this improvement was achieved in part through operation improvement strategies  including raw material cost reductions from supply chain expansion and volume purchasing  and improvements to manufacturing throughput and yield 
in addition  in fiscal we introduced a new solar laminate product with greater efficiency than its predecessor 
we believe that additional cost and efficiency improvements are achievable  and we have established a long range goal of raising our gross margin to in excess of 
at the same time  our gross profit margins have been and will be impacted by the higher costs including lower fixed cost absorption associated with production volumes during ramp up production to full capacity at new facilities as part of our overall manufacturing capacity expansion 
we are commercializing our nimh battery and oum technologies principally through unconsolidated joint ventures  and we account for our interests in these joint ventures under the accounting model based on the equity method of accounting 
our principal joint ventures cobasys and ovonyx were founded upon technologies that we pioneered to further develop and commercialize these technologies 
in each case  we participate in the business as equity holders but do not directly manage or have a controlling interest in the entity 
we have not reported any earnings or losses from cobasys because our only contributions to cobasys have been noncash items  including intellectual property and expertise 
we do record royalties from ovonyx representing of their total revenues 
these royalties were   and  respectively  for the years ended june   and the members of cobasys have agreed to explore strategic alternatives regarding cobasys 
in  the members of cobasys agreed to explore strategic alternatives regarding cobasys 
at the same time  as previously reported  certain disputes relating to cobasys are the subject of pending arbitration  and cobasys and its members have not agreed on a budget and or business plan 
on february  the parties entered into an interim settlement agreement providing for a suspension of the arbitration and a requirement of the parties to use their commercially reasonable best efforts to negotiate definitive agreements for the sale of cobasys based on a non binding proposal received from a potential buyer 
these sale negotiations have been ongoing  but we cannot assure that the proposed sale will be completed by the current deadline under our interim settlement agreement  if at all  or on terms favorable to us and obc 
if the proposed sale is not completed  without an agreed budget and business plan for and resolution of pending disputes subject to the arbitration between us and obc and ctv  cobasys may not be able to continue as a going concern

table of contents we are operating our ovonic materials segment at sustainable levels and are continuing to realize value from our technology portfolio 
we have developed proprietary technologies in our ovonic materials segment that we believe have substantial value  including technologies for nimh batteries  solid hydrogen storage  metal hydride fuel cells  and biofuel reformation 
as part of the restructuring plan discussed below  the development activities for these technologies have been substantially balanced with external sources of revenues  such as royalties and development agreements principally government contracts  to align our development commercialization efforts at sustainable levels 
we are continually evaluating commercialization opportunities and strategic alternatives to maximize value for these technologies  which may include licenses  joint ventures and sales 
key indicators of financial condition and operating performance 
in evaluating our business  we use product sales  gross profit  pre tax income  earnings per share  net income  cash flow from operations and other key performance metrics 
we also use production  measured in megawatts mw per annum  and gross margins on product sales as key performance metrics for our united solar segment  particularly in connection with the manufacturing expansion in this segment 
in april  we began implementing an organizational restructuring to consolidate and realign our business activities and reduce costs  including consolidating the photovoltaics and machine building activities into the united solar segment and reducing costs in both the ovonic materials segment and in corporate activities 
we have incurred total restructuring costs of million through june  we are continuing to evaluate our facilities infrastructure requirements based on our consolidated and realigned business activities to identify additional cost savings opportunities and may undertake additional restructuring activities  and record additional restructuring charges  as a result

other income expense and discontinued operations other income net increased to  in from  in  primarily due to higher interest income  in compared to  in as a result of increased funds available for investment and higher interest rates 
we also recognized less interest expense in due to capitalization of interest incurred during the construction of the new solar cell manufacturing equipment 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures associated with expansion of our united solar segment s manufacturing capacity and support our working capital requirements 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments which principally represent the proceeds from our june offering of convertible debt and common stock  cash flow from operations  and borrowing available under our new credit facility

the company  in the ordinary course of business  enters into purchase commitments for raw materials 
the company also enters into purchase commitments for capital equipment  including subcontracts for the purchase of components for the new solar manufacturing equipment being installed in greenville  michigan 
the increase in purchase commitments is primarily due to the aforementioned expansion plan  additional commitments to purchase steel for the new auburn hills facility  and construction and equipment commitments for the new greenville and tijuana facilities 
in june  we completed an offering of  of convertible senior notes 
interest is payable semi annually 
the notes mature on june  our contractual obligations include the following maturities in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating leases convertible senior notes purchase obligations total significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note a  the company and summary of accounting policies  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
however  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
as a result  actual results in these areas may differ significantly from our estimates 

table of contents we consider an accounting estimate to be significant if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate would have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
stock based compensation effective july   ecd adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
sfas no 
r requires that all stock based compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that such cost be measured at the fair value of the grant 
this statement was adopted using the modified prospective method of application  which requires us to recognize compensation expense on a prospective basis 
therefore  prior period financial statements have not been restated 
under this method  in addition to reflecting compensation expense for new share based grants  expense is also recognized to reflect the remaining service period of grants that had been included in pro forma disclosures in prior periods 
ecd records the fair value of stock based compensation grants as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  ecd applies the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment 
ecd uses an expected stock price volatility assumption that is based on historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock which is obtained from public data sources 
with regard to the weighted average option life assumption  ecd considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises 
patterns are determined on specific criteria of the aggregate pool of optionees 
forfeiture rates are based on the company s historical data for stock option forfeitures 
warranty liability we generally provide a year product warranty on power output on all uni solar products installed as part of pre engineered solutions 
our accrued warranty liability also includes warranties previously provided on our machine building and equipment products 
at june  and  the company had recorded a liability for future warranty claims of approximately  and  respectively 

table of contents allowance for uncollectible accounts the company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  previous loss history and the customer s current ability to pay its obligation 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at june  and  respectively 
federal taxes on income the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are provided for the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that the realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
at june   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of  expiring in through and an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of  which does not expire 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for all of the above tax benefits 
inventory reserves the company maintains an allowance for slow moving inventory for certain inventory items for which it does not expect to sell within the next twelve months 
the allowance was  and  at june  and  respectively 
government contracts  reserves and liabilities the company had a reserve for losses on government contracts of  and  at june  and  respectively 
our reserves and liabilities for government contracts reflects amounts questioned in an audit of certain government contracts by the defense contract audit agency and a reserve to reflect our residual royalty obligations under an advanced development agreement

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those described 
interest rate risk our holdings of financial instruments are comprised of debt securities 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities  or commodities  or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily  pending use in our business and operations 
the company had  and  of these investments on june  and june   respectively 
it is the company s policy that investments including cash equivalents shall be rated a or higher by moody s or standard and poor s  no single investment excluding cash equivalents shall represent more than of the portfolio and at least of the total portfolio shall have maturities of days or less 
our market risk primarily relates to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
an interest rate change of would result in a change in the value of our june   portfolio of approximately  the company invests in auction rate certificates 
recent market conditions have resulted in failures of certain auctions  however  the company s securities have not experienced such failures 
due to the recent temporary liquidation problems experience with certain securities  we have reclassified them as long term investments 
our convertible senior notes are subject to interest rate and market price risk due to the convertible feature of the notes 
since the notes are convertible to common stock  as the fair market value of our common stock increases  so will the fair market value of the notes 
conversely  as the fair market value of our common stock decrease  the fair market value of the notes will decrease as well 
as interest rates rise  the fair market value of the notes will decrease and as interest rates fall  the fair market value of the notes will increase 
at june   the estimated fair market value of our convertible senior notes was approximately  an increase or a decrease in market interest rates of would increase or decrease the fair value of our convertible senior notes by approximately  foreign exchange risk a significant portion of the equipment acquisitions necessary for our planned expansion are denominated in yen 
we have entered into contracts for equipment purchases that are denominated in yen 
in order to mitigate the risk associated with these transactions  we have entered in currency forward contracts to buy or sell yen at future dates 
as of june   we have forward contracts to purchase approximately million yen and to sell approximately million yen 
for the year ended june   an increase or a decrease in exchange rates of would increase or decrease our capital equipment purchases by approximately  we are unable to predict the future exchange rates between the dollar and the yen and therefore we cannot estimate the impact on our future operating results
