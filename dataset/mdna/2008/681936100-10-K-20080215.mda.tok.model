we maintain a diversified portfolio of long term healthcare facilities and mortgages on healthcare facilities located throughout the united states 
in making investments  we generally have focused on established  creditworthy  middle market healthcare operators that meet our standards for quality and experience of management 
we have sought to diversify our investments in terms of geographic locations and operators 
in evaluating potential investments  we consider such factors as the quality and experience of management and the creditworthiness of the operator of the facility  the facility s historical and forecasted cash flow and its ability to meet operational needs  capital expenditure requirements and lease or debt service obligations  providing a competitive return on our investment  the construction quality  condition and design of the facility  the geographic area of the facility  the tax  growth  regulatory and reimbursement environment of the jurisdiction in which the facility is located  the occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same or nearby communities  and the payor mix of private  medicare and medicaid patients 
one of our fundamental investment strategies is to obtain contractual rent escalations under long term  non cancelable  triple net leases and fixed rate mortgage loans  and to obtain substantial liquidity deposits 
additional security is typically provided by covenants regarding minimum working capital and net worth  liens on accounts receivable and other operating assets  and various provisions for cross default  cross collateralization and corporate personal guarantees  when appropriate 
we prefer to invest in equity ownership of properties 
due to regulatory  tax or other considerations  we may pursue alternative investment structures  which can achieve returns comparable to equity investments 
the following summarizes the primary investment structures we typically use 
average annualized yields reflect existing contractual arrangements 
however  in view of the ongoing financial challenges in the long term care industry  we cannot assure you that the operators of our facilities will meet their payment obligations in full or when due 
therefore  the annualized yields as of january  set forth below are not necessarily indicative of or a forecast of actual yields  which may be lower 
purchase leaseback 
in a purchase leaseback transaction  we purchase the property from the operator and lease it back to the operator over terms typically ranging from to years  plus renewal options 
the leases originated by us generally provide for minimum annual rentals which are subject to annual formula increases based upon such factors as increases in the consumer price index cpi 
the average annualized yield from leases was approximately at january  
table of contents fixed rate mortgage 
these mortgages have a fixed interest rate for the mortgage term and are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor 
the average annualized yield on these investments was approximately at january  the table set forth in item properties contains information regarding our real estate properties  their geographic locations  and the types of investment structures as of december  borrowing policies 
we may incur additional indebtedness and have historically sought to maintain an annualized total debt to ebitda ratio in the range of to times 
annualized ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for a twelve month period 
we intend to periodically review our policy with respect to our total debt to ebitda ratio and to modify the policy as our management deems prudent in light of prevailing market conditions 
our strategy generally has been to match the maturity of our indebtedness with the maturity of our investment assets and to employ long term  fixed rate debt to the extent practicable in view of market conditions in existence from time to time 
we may use proceeds of any additional indebtedness to provide permanent financing for investments in additional healthcare facilities 
we may obtain either secured or unsecured indebtedness and may obtain indebtedness that may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock 
where debt financing is available on terms deemed favorable  we generally may invest in properties subject to existing loans  secured by mortgages  deeds of trust or similar liens on properties 
if we need capital to repay indebtedness as it matures  we may be required to liquidate investments in properties at times which may not permit realization of the maximum recovery on these investments 
this could also result in adverse tax consequences to us 
we may be required to issue additional equity interests in our company  which could dilute your investment in our company 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
policies with respect to certain activities 
if our board of directors determines that additional funding is required  we may raise such funds through additional equity offerings  debt financing  and retention of cash flow subject to provisions in the internal revenue code concerning taxability of undistributed reit taxable income or a combination of these methods 
borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings  secured or unsecured  and publicly or privately placed debt instruments  purchase money obligations to the sellers of assets  long term  tax exempt bonds or financing from banks  institutional investors or other lenders  or securitizations  any of which indebtedness may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in our assets 
holders of such indebtedness may have recourse to all or any part of our assets or may be limited to the particular asset to which the indebtedness relates 
we have authority to offer our common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities and may engage in such activities in the future 
subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for reit qualification  we may invest in securities of other reits  other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers  including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities 
we may engage in the purchase and sale of investments 
we do not underwrite the securities of other issuers 
our officers and directors may change any of these policies without a vote of our stockholders 
in the opinion of our management  our properties are adequately covered by insurance 
taxation the following is a general summary of the material us federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to the holders of our securities and our election to be taxed as a reit 
it is not tax advice 
the summary is not intended to represent a detailed description of the us federal income tax consequences applicable to a particular stockholder in view of any person s particular circumstances  nor is it intended to represent a detailed description of the us federal income tax consequences applicable to stockholders subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws such as insurance companies  tax exempt organizations  financial institutions  securities broker dealers  investors in pass through entities  expatriates and taxpayers subject to alternative minimum taxation 

table of contents the following discussion  to the extent it constitutes matters of law or legal conclusions assuming the facts  representations  and assumptions upon which the discussion is based are accurate  accurately represents some of the material us federal income tax considerations relevant to ownership of our securities 
the sections of the internal revenue code the code relating to the qualification and operation as a reit are highly technical and complex 
the following discussion sets forth the material aspects of the code sections that govern the federal income tax treatment of a reit and its stockholders 
the information in this section is based on the code  current  temporary  and proposed treasury regulations promulgated under the code  the legislative history of the code  current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service irs  and court decisions  in each case  as of the date of this report 
in addition  the administrative interpretations and practices of the irs include its practices and policies as expressed in private letter rulings  which are not binding on the irs  except with respect to the particular taxpayers who requested and received those rulings 
general 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit  under sections through of the code  beginning with our taxable year ended december  we believe that we have been organized and operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit 
we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will maintain our qualification as a reit  but no assurance can be given that we have operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 
the sections of the code that govern the federal income tax treatment of a reit are highly technical and complex 
the following sets forth the material aspects of those sections 
this summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable code provisions  rules and regulations promulgated thereunder  and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof 
if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders 
however  we will be subject to federal income tax as follows first  we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed reit taxable income  including undistributed net capital gains  provided  however  that if we have a net capital gain  we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on our undistributed reit taxable income  computed without regard to net capital gain and the deduction for capital gains dividends  plus a tax on undistributed net capital gain  if our tax as thus computed is less than the tax computed in the regular manner 
second  under certain circumstances  we may be subject to the alternative minimum tax on our items of tax preference that we do not distribute or allocate to our stockholders 
third  if we have i net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property  which is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business  or ii other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property  we will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate on such income 
fourth  if we have net income from prohibited transactions which are  in general  certain sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business by us  ie  when we are acting as a dealer  such income will be subject to a tax 
fifth  if we should fail to satisfy the gross income test or the gross income test as discussed below  but have nonetheless maintained our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements have been met  we will be subject to a tax on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to the greater of the amount by which we fail the or test  multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 
sixth  if we should fail to distribute by the end of each year at least the sum of i of our reit ordinary income for such year  ii of our reit capital gain net income for such year  and iii any undistributed taxable income from prior periods  we will be subject to a excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed 
seventh  we will be subject to a excise tax on transactions with a taxable reit subsidiary trs that are not conducted on an arm s length basis 
eighth  if we acquire any asset  which is defined as a built in gain asset from a c corporation that is not a reit ie  generally a corporation subject to full corporate level tax in a transaction in which the basis of the built in gain asset in our hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset or any other property in the hands of the c corporation  and we recognize gain on the disposition of such asset during the year period  which is defined as the recognition period  beginning on the date on which such asset was acquired by us  then  to the extent of the built in gain ie  the excess of a the fair market value of such asset on the date such asset was acquired by us over b our adjusted basis in such asset on such date  our recognized gain will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate 
the results described above with respect to the recognition of built in gain assume that we will not make an election pursuant to treasury regulations section d c 
requirements for qualification 
the code defines a reit as a corporation  trust or association which is managed by one or more trustees or directors  the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares  or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest  which would be taxable as a domestic corporation  but for sections through of the code  which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to the provisions of the code  the beneficial ownership of which is held by or more persons  during the last half year of each taxable year not more than in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities  and which meets certain other tests  described below  regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its annual distributions to stockholders 
the code provides that conditions to  inclusive  must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition must be met during at least days of a taxable year of twelve months  or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than twelve months 
for purposes of conditions and  pension funds and certain other tax exempt entities are treated as individuals  subject to a look through exception in the case of condition 

table of contents income tests 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  we annually must satisfy two gross income requirements 
first  at least of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including generally rents from real property  interest on mortgages on real property  and gains on sale of real property and real property mortgages  other than property described in section a of the code and income derived from certain types of temporary investments 
second  at least of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived from such real property investments  dividends  interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities other than property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
rents received by us will qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income requirements for a reit described above only if several conditions are met 
first  the amount of the rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person 
however  any amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term rents from real property solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 
second  the code provides that rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income tests if we  or an owner actually or constructively of or more of the value of our stock  actually or constructively owns or more of such tenant  which is defined as a related party tenant 
third  if rent attributable to personal property  leased in connection with a lease of real property  is greater than of the total rent received under the lease  then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as rents from real property 
finally  for rents received to qualify as rents from real property  we generally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or render services to the tenants of such property  other than through an independent contractor from which we derive no revenue 
we may  however  directly perform certain services that are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant of the property 
in addition  we may provide a minimal amount of non customary services to the tenants of a property  other than through an independent contractor  as long as our income from the services does not exceed of our income from the related property 
furthermore  we may own up to of the stock of a trs  which may provide customary and non customary services to our tenants without tainting our rental income from the related properties 
for our tax years beginning after  rents for customary services performed by a trs or that are received from a trs and are described in code section b no longer need to meet the excise tax safe harbor 
instead  such payments avoid the excise tax if we pay the trs at least of its direct cost of furnishing such services 
the term interest generally does not include any amount received or accrued directly or indirectly if the determination of such amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person 
however  an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term interest solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of gross receipts or sales 
in addition  an amount that is based on the income or profits of a debtor will be qualifying interest income as long as the debtor derives substantially all of its income from the real property securing the debt from leasing substantially all of its interest in the property  but only to the extent that the amounts received by the debtor would be qualifying rents from real property if received directly by a reit 
if a loan contains a provision that entitles us to a percentage of the borrower s gain upon the sale of the real property securing the loan or a percentage of the appreciation in the property s value as of a specific date  income attributable to that loan provision will be treated as gain from the sale of the property securing the loan  which generally is qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests 
interest on debt secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property generally is qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test 
however  if the highest principal amount of a loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan as of the date we agreed to originate or acquire the loan  a portion of the interest income from such loan will not be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  but will be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test 
the portion of the interest income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test will be equal to the portion of the principal amount of the loan that is not secured by real property 
prohibited transactions 
we will incur a tax on the net income derived from any sale or other disposition of property  other than foreclosure property  that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
we believe that none of our assets is primarily held for sale to customers and that a sale of any of our assets would not be in the ordinary course of our business 
whether a reit holds an asset primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends  however  on the facts and circumstances in effect from time to time  including those related to a particular asset 
nevertheless  we will attempt to comply with the terms of safe harbor provisions in the federal income tax laws prescribing when an asset sale will not be characterized as a prohibited transaction 
we cannot assure you  however  that we can comply with the safe harbor provisions or that we will avoid owning property that may be characterized as property that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 

table of contents foreclosure property 
we will be subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate on any income from foreclosure property  other than income that otherwise would be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  less expenses directly connected with the production of that income 
however  gross income from foreclosure property is treated as qualifying for purposes of the and gross income tests 
foreclosure property is any real property  including interests in real property  and any personal property incident to such real property that is acquired by a reit as the result of the reit having bid on such property at foreclosure  or having otherwise reduced such property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law  after there was a default or default was imminent on a lease of such property or on indebtedness that such property secured  for which the related loan or lease was acquired by the reit at a time when the default was not imminent or anticipated  and for which the reit makes a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property 
property generally ceases to be foreclosure property at the end of the third taxable year following the taxable year in which the reit acquired the property  or longer if an extension is granted by the secretary of the treasury 
this grace period terminates and foreclosure property ceases to be foreclosure property on the first day on which a lease is entered into for the property that  by its terms  will give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of the gross income test  or any amount is received or accrued  directly or indirectly  pursuant to a lease entered into on or after such day that will give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of the gross income test  on which any construction takes place on the property  other than completion of a building or any other improvement  where more than of the construction was completed before default became imminent  or which is more than days after the day on which the reit acquired the property and the property is used in a trade or business which is conducted by the reit  other than through an independent contractor from whom the reit itself does not derive or receive any income 
after the year  the definition of foreclosure property was amended to include any qualified health care property  as defined in code section e acquired by us as the result of the termination or expiration of a lease of such property 
we have operated qualified healthcare facilities acquired in this manner for up to two years or longer if an extension was granted 
however  we do not currently own any property with respect to which we have made foreclosure property elections 
properties that we had taken back in a foreclosure or bankruptcy and operated for our own account were treated as foreclosure properties for income tax purposes  pursuant to internal revenue code section e 
gross income from foreclosure properties was classified as good income for purposes of the annual reit income tests upon making the election on the tax return 
once made  the income was classified as good for a period of three years  or until the properties were no longer operated for our own account 
in all cases of foreclosure property  we utilized an independent contractor to conduct day to day operations in order to maintain reit status 
in certain cases we operated these facilities through a taxable reit subsidiary 
for those properties operated through the taxable reit subsidiary  we utilized an eligible independent contractor to conduct day to day operations to maintain reit status 
as a result of the foregoing  we do not believe that our participation in the operation of nursing homes increased the risk that we would fail to qualify as a reit 
through our taxable year  we had not paid any tax on our foreclosure property because those properties had been producing losses 
we cannot predict whether  in the future  our income from foreclosure property will be significant and or whether we could be required to pay a significant amount of tax on that income 

table of contents hedging transactions 
from time to time  we enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities 
our hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps  caps and floors  options to purchase these items  and futures and forward contracts 
to the extent that we enter into an interest rate swap or cap contract  option  futures contract  forward rate agreement  or any similar financial instrument to hedge our indebtedness incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets  any periodic income or gain from the disposition of that contract should be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  but not the gross income test 
accordingly  our income and gain from our interest rate swap agreements generally is qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  but not the gross income test 
to the extent that we hedge with other types of financial instruments  or in other situations  it is not entirely clear how the income from those transactions will be treated for purposes of the gross income tests 
we have structured and intend to continue to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a reit 
for tax years beginning after  we were no longer required to include income from hedging transactions in gross income ie  not included in either the numerator or the denominator for purposes of the gross income test 
trs income 
a trs may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent reit 
both the subsidiary and the reit must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a trs 
a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a trs 
overall  no more than of the value of a reit s assets may consist of securities of one or more trss 
however  a trs does not include a corporation which directly or indirectly i operates or manages a health care or lodging facility  or ii provides to any other person under a franchise  license  or otherwise rights to any brand name under which a health care or lodging facility is operated 
a trs will pay income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns 
in addition  the new rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation 
the rules also impose a excise tax on transactions between a trs and its parent reit or the reit s tenants that are not conducted on an arm s length basis 
failure to satisfy income tests 
if we fail to satisfy one or both of the or gross income tests for any taxable year  we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code 
these relief provisions will be generally available if our failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect  we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our tax return  and any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax 
it is not possible  however  to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 
even if these relief provisions apply  we would incur a tax on the gross income attributable to the greater of the amounts by which we fail the and gross income tests  multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability and we would file a schedule with descriptions of each item of gross income that caused the failure 
resolution of related party tenant issue 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that  due to certain provisions of the series b preferred stock issued to us by advocat  inc advocat in in connection with a restructuring  advocat may have been considered to be a related party tenant under the rules applicable to reits 
as a result  we took steps in to restructure our relationship with advocat and ownership of advocat securities in order to avoid having the rent received from advocat classified as received from a related party tenant in taxable years after  and submitted a request to the irs on december   that in the event that rental income received by us from advocat would not be qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests  such failure during taxable years prior to was due to reasonable cause 
during  we entered into closing agreement with the irs covering all affected taxable periods prior to to the effect that our failure to meet the gross income tests as a result of the advocat rental income being considered to be received from a related party tenant was due to reasonable cause 
in connection with reaching this agreement with the irs as to the advocat related party tenant income issue  we paid to the irs penalty income taxes and interest totaling approximately million for the tax years through we had previously accrued million of income tax liabilities as of december  as a result of the execution of closing agreement with the irs as to our taxable years through and the restructuring of our relationship with advocat in october  we believe we have fully resolved all tax issues relating to rental income received from advocat prior to and have been advised by tax counsel that we will not receive any non qualifying related party tenant income from advocat in and future fiscal years 
accordingly  we do not expect to incur tax expense associated with related party tenant income in periods commencing january  asset tests 
at the close of each quarter of our taxable year  we must also satisfy the following tests relating to the nature of our assets 
first  at least of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets including i our allocable share of real estate assets held by partnerships in which we own an interest and ii stock or debt instruments held for not more than one year purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long term at least five years debt offering of our company  cash  cash items and government securities 
second  of our investments not included in the asset class  the value of our interest in any one issuer s securities may not exceed of the value of our total assets 
third  we may not own more than of the voting power or value of any one issuer s outstanding securities 
fourth  no more than of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more trss 
fifth  no more than of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of trss and other non trs taxable subsidiaries and other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the asset test 

table of contents for purposes of the second and third asset tests the term securities does not include our equity or debt securities of a qualified reit subsidiary  a trs  or an equity interest in any partnership  since we are deemed to own our proportionate share of each asset of any partnership of which we are a partner 
furthermore  for purposes of determining whether we own more than of the value of only one issuer s outstanding securities  the term securities does not include i any loan to an individual or an estate  ii any code section rental agreement  iii any obligation to pay rents from real property  iv certain government issued securities  v any security issued by another reit  and vi our debt securities in any partnership  not otherwise excepted under i through v above  a to the extent of our interest as a partner in the partnership or b if of the partnership s gross income is derived from sources described in the income test set forth above 
we may own up to of the stock of one or more trss 
however  overall  no more than of the value of our assets may consist of securities of one or more trss  and no more than of the value of our assets may consist of the securities of trss and other non trs taxable subsidiaries including stock in non reit c corporations and other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the asset test 
if the outstanding principal balance of a mortgage loan exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan  a portion of such loan likely will not be a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the test 
the nonqualifying portion of that mortgage loan will be equal to the portion of the loan amount that exceeds the value of the associated real property 
after initially meeting the asset tests at the close of any quarter  we will not lose our status as a reit for failure to satisfy any of the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values 
if the failure to satisfy the asset tests results from an acquisition of securities or other property during a quarter  the failure can be cured by disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets within days after the close of that quarter 
for our tax years beginning after  subject to certain de minimis exceptions  we may avoid reit disqualification in the event of certain failures under the asset tests  provided that i we file a schedule with a description of each asset that caused the failure  ii the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect  iii we dispose of the assets within months after the last day of the quarter in which the identification of the failure occurred or the requirements of the rules are otherwise met within such period  and iv we pay a tax on the failure equal to the greater of a  per failure  and b the product of the net income generated by the assets that caused the failure for the period beginning on the date of the failure and ending on the date we dispose of the asset or otherwise satisfy the requirements multiplied by the highest applicable corporate tax rate 
annual distribution requirements 
in order to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus b the sum of certain items of noncash income 
such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration 
in addition  such distributions are required to be made pro rata  with no preference to any share of stock as compared with other shares of the same class  and with no preference to one class of stock as compared with another class except to the extent that such class is entitled to such a preference 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain  or distribute at least  but less than of our reit taxable income  as adjusted  we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates 
furthermore  if we fail to distribute during a calendar year  or by the end of january following the calendar year in the case of distributions with declaration and record dates falling in the last three months of the calendar year  at least the sum of of our reit ordinary income for such year  of our reit capital gain income for such year  and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods  we will incur a nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts we actually distribute 
we may elect to retain and pay income tax on the net long term capital gain we receive in a taxable year 
if we so elect  we will be treated as having distributed any such retained amount for purposes of the excise tax described above 
we have made  and we intend to continue to make  timely distributions sufficient to satisfy the annual distribution requirements 
we may also be entitled to pay and deduct deficiency dividends in later years as a relief measure to correct errors in determining our taxable income 
although we may be able to avoid income tax on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends  we will be required to pay interest to the irs based upon the amount of any deduction we take for deficiency dividends 

table of contents the availability to us of  among other things  depreciation deductions with respect to our owned facilities depends upon the treatment by us as the owner of such facilities for federal income tax purposes  and the classification of the leases with respect to such facilities as true leases rather than financing arrangements for federal income tax purposes 
the questions of whether we are the owner of such facilities and ii the leases are true leases for federal tax purposes  are essentially factual matters 
we believe that we will be treated as the owner of each of the facilities that we lease  and such leases will be treated as true leases for federal income tax purposes 
however  no assurances can be given that the irs will not successfully challenge our status as the owner of our facilities subject to leases  and the status of such leases as true leases  asserting that the purchase of the facilities by us and the leasing of such facilities merely constitute steps in secured financing transactions in which the lessees are owners of the facilities and we are merely a secured creditor 
in such event  we would not be entitled to claim depreciation deductions with respect to any of the affected facilities 
as a result  we might fail to meet the distribution requirement or  if such requirement is met  we might be subject to corporate income tax or the excise tax 
reasonable cause savings clause 
we may avoid disqualification in the event of a failure to meet certain requirements for reit qualification if the failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect  and if the reit pays a penalty of  for each such failure 
this reasonable cause safe harbor is not available for failures to meet the and gross income tests  the rules with respect to ownership of securities of more than of a single issuer  and the new rules provided for failures of the asset tests 
failure to qualify 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  and the reasonable cause relief provisions do not apply  we will be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify will not be deductible and our failure to qualify as a reit would reduce the cash available for distribution by us to our stockholders 
in addition  if we fail to qualify as a reit  all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income  to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits  and  subject to certain limitations of the code  corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we would also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to such statutory relief 
failure to qualify could result in our incurring indebtedness or liquidating investments in order to pay the resulting taxes 
other tax matters 
we own and operate a number of properties through qualified reit subsidiaries  qrss 
the qrss are treated as qualified reit subsidiaries under the code 
code section i provides that a corporation which is a qualified reit subsidiary shall not be treated as a separate corporation  and all assets  liabilities  and items of income  deduction  and credit of a qualified reit subsidiary shall be treated as assets  liabilities and such items as the case may be of the reit 
thus  in applying the tests for reit qualification described in this prospectus under the heading taxation of omega  the qrss will be ignored  and all assets  liabilities and items of income  deduction  and credit of such qrss will be treated as our assets  liabilities and items of income  deduction  and credit 
in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership  the reit is treated as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership and as earning its allocable share of the gross income of the partnership for purposes of the applicable reit qualification tests 
thus  our proportionate share of the assets  liabilities  and items of income of any partnership  joint venture  or limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in which we own an interest  directly or indirectly  will be treated as our assets and gross income for purposes of applying the various reit qualification requirements 
healthcare reimbursement and regulation medicare 
all of our properties are used as healthcare facilities  therefore  we are directly affected by the risk associated with the healthcare industry 
our lessees and mortgagors  as well as any facilities that may be owned and operated for our own account from time to time  derive a substantial portion of their net operating revenues from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs 
these programs are highly regulated by federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations and are subject to frequent and substantial change 

table of contents in  the balanced budget act significantly reduced spending levels for the medicare and medicaid programs  in part because the legislation modified the payment methodology for snfs by shifting payments for services provided to medicare beneficiaries from a reasonable cost basis to a prospective payment system 
under the prospective payment system  snfs are paid on a per diem prospective case mix adjusted basis for all covered services 
implementation of the prospective payment system has affected each long term care facility to a different degree  depending upon the amount of revenue such facility derives from medicare patients 
legislation adopted in and provided for a few temporary increases to medicare payment rates  but these temporary increases have since expired 
specifically  in the balanced budget refinement act included a across the board increase of the adjusted federal per diem payment rates for all patient acuity categories known as resource utilization groups or rugs that were in effect from april through september  in  the benefits improvement and protection act included a increase in the nursing component of the case mix adjusted federal periodic payment rate  which was implemented in april and also expired october  the october  expiration of these temporary increases has had an adverse impact on the revenues of the operators of snfs and has negatively impacted some operators ability to satisfy their monthly lease or debt payments to us 
the balanced budget refinement act and the benefits improvement and protection act also established temporary increases  beginning in april  to medicare payment rates to snfs that were designated to remain in place until the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  implemented refinements to the existing rug case mix classification system to more accurately estimate the cost of non therapy ancillary services 
the balanced budget refinement act provided for a increase for rug categories until cms modified the rug case mix classification system 
the benefits improvement and protection act modified this payment increase by reducing the increase for three of the rugs to a increase and instituting an additional increase for eleven other rugs 
on august   cms published its final rule  effective october   establishing medicare payments for snfs under the prospective payment system for federal fiscal year october  to september  
the final rule modified the rug case mix classification system and added nine new categories to the system  expanding the number of rugs from to the implementation of the rug refinements triggered the expiration of the temporary payment increases of and established by the balanced budget refinement act and the benefits improvement and protection act  respectively 
additionally  cms announced updates in the final rule to reimbursement rates for snfs in federal fiscal year based on an increase in the full market basket of 
in the august  final rule  cms estimated that the increases in medicare reimbursements to snfs arising from the refinements to the prospective payment system and the market basket update under the final rule would offset the reductions stemming from the elimination of the temporary increases during federal fiscal year cms estimated that there would be an overall increase in medicare payments to snfs totaling million in fiscal year compared to on july   cms posted a notice updating the payment rates to snfs for fiscal year october  to september  
the market basket increase factor for was 
cms estimated that the payment update would increase aggregate payments to snfs nationwide by approximately million in fiscal year compared to on august   cms published its final rule for updating the payment rates used under the prospective payment system for snfs for federal fiscal year october  to september  
the market basket increase for fiscal year is 
under the final rule  aggregate medicare payments for nursing homes would increase by approximately million for fiscal year in addition  the rule revises and rebases the snf market basket  which is used in calculating snf payment rates 
in august  the united states house of representatives passed the children s health and medicare protection champ act  which proposed significant cuts to the medicare program 
this bill would have limited the snf market basket increase for to the first quarter of fiscal year after the first quarter  the bill would have decreased the update to zero 
although congress did not include this provision in the medicare legislation enacted in december  the house of representatives subsequently dropped these and all other medicare provisions from the legislation  it remains possible that such medicare provisions will be considered by the full congress in the future 
a temporary increase in the per diem amount paid to snfs for residents who have aids took effect on october  this temporary payment increase arose from the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  or the medicare modernization act 
although cms also noted that the aids add on was not intended to be permanent  the increase remained in effect through fiscal year and the final rule updating payment rates for snfs for fiscal year indicated that the increase will continue to remain in effect for fiscal year 
table of contents a significant change enacted under the medicare modernization act is the creation of a new prescription drug benefit  medicare part d  which went into effect january  the significant expansion of benefits for medicare beneficiaries arising under the expanded prescription drug benefit could result in financial pressures on the medicare program that might could result in future legislative and regulatory changes with impacts for our operators 
as part of this new program  the prescription drug benefits for patients who are dually eligible for both medicare and medicaid are being transitioned from medicaid to medicare  and many of these patients reside in long term care facilities 
the medicare program experienced significant operational difficulties in transitioning prescription drug coverage for this population when the benefit went into effect on january  although it is unclear whether or how issues involving medicare part d might have any direct financial impacts on our operators  a june report by the medicare payment advisory commission medpac  which is an independent body that advises congress on medicare payment policies examined how part d is affecting pharmacy services for residents of nursing facilities and other stakeholders and considered alternative approaches for delivering part d benefits in nursing facilities 
medpac did not make recommendations  although the report indicated that medpac will continue monitoring the delivery of part d benefits to residents of long term care facilities 
on february   the president signed into law a billion budget reconciliation package called the deficit reduction act of deficit reduction act  to lower the federal budget deficit 
the deficit reduction act included estimated net savings of billion from the medicare program over years 
the deficit reduction act contained a provision reducing payments to snfs for allowable bad debts 
previously  medicare reimbursed snfs for of beneficiary bad debt arising from unpaid deductibles and coinsurance amounts 
in  cms released a proposed rule seeking to reduce bad debt reimbursement rates for certain providers  including snfs  by over a three year period 
subsequently  in early the deficit reduction act reduced payments to snfs for allowable bad debts by effective october  for those individuals not dually eligible for both medicare and medicaid 
bad debt payments for the dually eligible population will remain at 
consistent with this legislation  cms finalized its proposed rule on august   and the regulations became effective on october  cms estimates that implementation of this bad debt provision will result in a savings to the medicare program of million from fy to fy the deficit reduction act also contained a provision governing the therapy caps that went into place under medicare on january  the therapy caps limit the physical therapy  speech language therapy and occupation therapy services that a medicare beneficiary can receive during a calendar year 
the therapy caps were in effect for calendar year and then suspended by congress for three years 
an inflation adjusted therapy limit  per year was implemented in september of  but then once again suspended in december of by the medicare modernization act 
under the medicare modernization act  congress placed a two year moratorium on implementation of the caps  which expired at the end of the inflation adjusted therapy caps are set at  for calendar year these caps do not apply to therapy services covered under medicare part a in a snf  although the caps apply in most other instances involving patients in snfs or long term care facilities who receive therapy services covered under medicare part b 
the deficit reduction act permitted exceptions in for therapy services to exceed the caps when the therapy services are deemed medically necessary by the medicare program 
the tax relief and health care act of  signed into law on december   extend these exceptions through december  the medicare  medicaid  and schip extension act of signed into law on december  extend the exceptions through june  future and continued implementation of the therapy caps could have a material adverse effect on our operators financial condition and operations  which could adversely affect their ability to meet their payment obligations to us 
in general  we cannot be assured that federal reimbursement will remain at levels comparable to present levels or that such reimbursement will be sufficient for our lessees or mortgagors to cover all operating and fixed costs necessary to care for medicare and medicaid patients 
we also cannot be assured that there will be any future legislation to increase medicare payment rates for snfs  and if such payment rates for snfs are not increased in the future  some of our lessees and mortgagors may have difficulty meeting their payment obligations to us 
medicaid and other third party reimbursement 
each state has its own medicaid program that is funded jointly by the state and federal government 
federal law governs how each state manages its medicaid program  but there is wide latitude for states to customize medicaid programs to fit the needs and resources of their citizens 
currently  medicaid is the single largest source of financing for long term care in the united states 
rising medicaid costs and decreasing state revenues caused by recent economic conditions have prompted an increasing number of states to cut or consider reductions in medicaid funding as a means of balancing their respective state budgets 
existing and future initiatives affecting medicaid reimbursement may reduce utilization of and reimbursement for services offered by the operators of our properties 

table of contents in recent years  many states have announced actual or potential budget shortfalls 
as a result of these budget shortfalls  many states have announced that they are implementing or considering implementing freezes or cuts in medicaid reimbursement rates  including rates paid to snf and long term care providers  or reductions in medicaid enrollee benefits  including long term care benefits 
we cannot predict the extent to which medicaid rate freezes  cuts or benefit reductions ultimately will be adopted  the number of states that will adopt them or the impact of such adoption on our operators 
however  extensive medicaid rate cuts  freezes or benefit reductions could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity  financial condition and operations  which could adversely affect their ability to make lease or mortgage payments to us 
the deficit reduction act included billion in estimated savings from medicaid and the state children s health insurance program over five years 
the deficit reduction act gave states the option to increase medicaid cost sharing and reduce medicaid benefits  accounting for an estimated billion in federal savings over five years 
the remainder of the medicaid savings under the deficit reduction act comes primarily from changes to prescription drug reimbursement billion in savings over five years and tightened policies governing asset transfers billion in savings over five years 
asset transfer policies  which determine medicaid eligibility based on whether a medicaid applicant has transferred assets for less than fair value  became more restrictive under the deficit reduction act  which extended the look back period to five years  moved the start of the penalty period and made individuals with more than  in home equity ineligible for nursing home benefits previously  the home was excluded as a countable asset for purposes of medicaid eligibility 
these changes could have a material adverse effect on our operators financial conditions and operations  which could adversely affect their ability to meet their payment obligations to us 
private payors  including managed care payors  increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk of operating a healthcare facility 
efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls are expected to continue 
any changes in reimbursement policies that reduce reimbursement levels could adversely affect the revenues of our lessees and mortgagors  thereby adversely affecting those lessees and mortgagors abilities to make their monthly lease or debt payments to us 
in may of  cms awarded states and the district of columbia grants totaling over million to build medicaid long term care programs that provide alternatives to nursing home care and help keep people remain at home 
similarly  individual states have been promoting alternatives to nursing homes to cope with the aging population through laws and the development and promotion of community based systems of care 
cms grants and the activities of states evidence a shift from a focus on institutional care to a system that offers more choices  including home and community based services 
this trend could have potential adverse effects on our operators financial conditions  which could affect their ability to meet their payment obligations to us 
fraud and abuse laws and regulations 
there are various extremely complex and largely uninterpreted federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals  relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers  including criminal provisions that prohibit filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment or certification under medicare and medicaid  and failing to refund overpayments or improper payments 
the federal and state governments are devoting increasing attention and resources to anti fraud initiatives against healthcare providers 
penalties for healthcare fraud have been increased and expanded over recent years  including broader provisions for the exclusion of providers from the medicare and medicaid programs 
the office of the inspector general for the us department of health and human services oig hhs  has described a number of ongoing and new initiatives for to study instances of potential overbilling and or fraud in snfs and nursing homes under both medicare and medicaid 
the oig hhs  in cooperation with other federal and state agencies  also continues to focus on the activities of snfs in certain states in which we have properties 
in addition  the federal false claims act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government s recovery 
because of these monetary incentives  these so called whistleblower suits have become more frequent 
some states currently have statutes that are analogous to the federal false claims act 
the deficit reduction act encourages additional states to enact such legislation and may encourage increased enforcement activity by permitting states to retain of any recovery for that state s medicaid program if the enacted legislation is at least as rigorous as the federal false claims act 
the violation of any of these laws or regulations by an operator may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties that could jeopardize that operator s ability to make lease or mortgage payments to us or to continue operating its facility 

table of contents other laws 
other laws that impact how our operators conduct their operations include federal and state laws designed to protect the confidentiality and security of patient health information  state and local licensure laws  laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices  and laws generally affecting our operators management of property and equipment and how our operators generally conduct their operations  such as fire  and health and safety laws  and federal and state laws affecting assisted living facilities mandating quality of services and care  and quality of food service  resident rights including abuse and neglect laws and health standards set by the federal occupational safety and health administration 
additional costs to comply with these rules could have a material adverse effect on our operators financial condition  which could cause the revenues of our operators to decline and potentially jeopardize their ability to meet their obligations to us 
legislative and regulatory developments 
each year  legislative and regulatory proposals are introduced or proposed in congress and state legislatures as well as by federal and state agencies that  if implemented  could result in major changes in the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
in addition  regulatory proposals and rules are released on an ongoing basis that may have major impacts on the healthcare system generally and the industries in which our operators do business 
legislative and regulatory developments can be expected to occur on an ongoing basis at the local  state and federal levels that have direct or indirect impacts on the policies governing the reimbursement levels paid to our facilities by public and private third party payors  the costs of doing business and the threshold requirements that must be met for facilities to continue operation or to expand 
the medicare modernization act  which is one example of such legislation  was enacted in december the significant expansion of other benefits for medicare beneficiaries under this act  such as the prescription drug benefit  could create financial pressures on the medicare program that might result in future legislative and regulatory changes with impacts on our operators 
although the creation of a prescription drug benefit for medicare beneficiaries was expected to generate fiscal relief for state medicaid programs  the structure of the benefit and costs associated with its implementation may mitigate the relief for states that originally was anticipated 
the deficit reduction act is another example of such legislation 
the provisions in the legislation designed to create cost savings from both medicare and medicaid could diminish reimbursement for our operators under both medicare and medicaid 
cms also launched  in  the nursing home quality initiative program in  which requires nursing homes participating in medicare to provide consumers with comparative information about the quality of care at the facility 
in the fall of  cms plans to initiate a new quality campaign  advancing excellence for america s nursing home residents  to be conducted over the next two years with the ultimate goal being improvement in quality of life and efficiency of care delivery 
in the event any of our operators do not maintain the same or superior levels of quality care as their competitors  patients could choose alternate facilities  which could adversely impact our operators revenues 
in addition  the reporting of such information could lead to reimbursement policies that reward or penalize facilities on the basis of the reported quality of care parameters 
in late  cms began soliciting public comments regarding a demonstration to examine pay for performance approaches in the nursing home setting that would offer financial incentives for facilities delivering high quality care 
cms anticipates that the demonstration will begin in cms will also commence the next phase of the post acute care payment reform demonstration pac prd project in  where information will be collected about medicare beneficiaries experiences in post acute care settings 
the purpose of the demonstration project  which was mandated by the deficit reduction act of  is to use the information obtained to guide future medicare payment policy 
other proposals under consideration include efforts by individual states to control costs by decreasing state medicaid reimbursements in the current or future fiscal years and federal legislation addressing various issues  such as improving quality of care and reducing medical errors throughout the health care industry 
we cannot accurately predict whether specific proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  what effect  if any  these proposals would have on operators and  thus  our business

item a risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below 
these risks are not the only ones that we may face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of  or that we currently deem immaterial  also may become important factors that affect us 
if any of the following risks occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to the operators of our facilities our financial position could be weakened and our ability to fulfill our obligations under our indebtedness could be limited if any of our major operators were unable to meet their obligations to us or failed to renew or extend their relationship with us as their lease terms expire  or if we were unable to lease or re lease our facilities or make mortgage loans on economically favorable terms 
these adverse developments could arise due to a number of factors  including those listed below 
the bankruptcy  insolvency or financial deterioration of our operators could delay our ability to collect unpaid rents or require us to find new operators for rejected facilities 
we are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to meet their obligations  which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency 
although our leases and loans provide us the right to terminate an investment  evict an operator  demand immediate repayment and other remedies  title of the united states code  usc  as amended and supplemented  the bankruptcy code  affords certain protections to a party that has filed for bankruptcy that would probably render certain of these remedies unenforceable  or  at the very least  delay our ability to pursue such remedies 
in addition  an operator in bankruptcy may be able to restrict our ability to collect unpaid rent or mortgage payments during the bankruptcy case 

table of contents furthermore  the receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any federal  state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility 
in addition  some significant expenditures associated with real estate investment  such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment 
in order to protect our investments  we may take possession of a property or even become licensed as an operator  which might expose us to successor liability under government programs or otherwise or require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses 
third party payors may also suspend payments to us following foreclosure until we receive the required licenses to operate the facilities 
should such events occur  our income and cash flow from operations would be adversely affected 
a debtor may have the right to assume or reject a lease with us under bankruptcy law and his or her decision could delay or limit our ability to collect rents thereunder 
if one or more of our lessees files bankruptcy relief  the bankruptcy code provides that a debtor has the option to assume or reject the unexpired lease within a certain period of time 
however  our lease arrangements with operators that operate more than one of our facilities are generally made pursuant to a single master lease covering all of that operator s facilities leased from us  and consequently  it is possible that in bankruptcy the debtor lessee may be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole  rather than making the decision on a facility by facility basis  thereby preventing the debtor lessee from assuming only the better performing facilities and terminating the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing facilities 
the bankruptcy code generally requires that a debtor must assume or reject a contract in its entirety 
thus  a debtor cannot choose to keep the beneficial provisions of a contract while rejecting the burdensome ones  the contract must be assumed or rejected as a whole 
however  where under applicable law a contract even though it is contained in a single document is determined to be divisible or severable into different agreements  or similarly where a collection of documents are determined to constitute separate agreements instead of a single  integrated contract  then in those circumstances a debtor trustee may be allowed to assume some of the divisible or separate agreements while rejecting the others 
whether a master lease agreement would be determined to be a single contract or a divisible agreement  and hence whether a bankruptcy court would require a master lease agreement to be assumed or rejected as a whole  would depend on a number of factors some of which may include  but may not necessarily be limited to  the following applicable state law  the parties intent  whether the master lease agreement and related documents were executed contemporaneously  the nature and purpose of the relevant documents  whether the obligations in various documents are independent  whether the leases are coterminous  whether a single check is paid for all properties  whether rent is apportioned among the leases  whether termination of one lease constitutes termination of all  whether the leases may be separately assigned or sublet  whether separate consideration exists for each lease  and whether there are cross default provisions 
the bankruptcy code provides that a debtor has the power and the option to assume  assume and assign to a third party  or reject the unexpired lease 
in the event that the unexpired lease is assumed on behalf of the debtor lessee  obligations under the lease generally would be entitled to administrative priority over other unsecured pre bankruptcy claims 
if the debtor chooses to assume the lease or assume and assign the lease  then the debtor is required to cure all monetary defaults  or provide adequate assurance that it will promptly cure such defaults 
however  the debtor lessee may not have to cure historical non monetary defaults under the lease to the extent that they have not resulted in an actual pecuniary loss  but the debtor lessee must cure non monetary defaults under the lease from the time of assumption going forward 
a debtor must generally pay all rent payments coming due under the lease after the bankruptcy filing but before the assumption or rejection of the lease 
the bankruptcy code provides that the debtor lessee must make the decision regarding assumption  assignment or rejection within a certain period of time 
for cases filed on or after october   the time period to make the decision is days  subject to extension for cause 
a bankruptcy court may only extend this period beyond days if the lessor consents in writing 

table of contents if a tenant rejects a lease under the bankruptcy code  it is deemed to be a pre petition breach of the lease  and the lessor s claim arising therefrom may be limited to any unpaid rent already due plus an amount equal to the rent reserved under the lease  without acceleration  for the greater of one year  or  not to exceed three years  of the remaining term of such lease  following the earlier of the petition date and repossession or surrender of the leased property 
if the debtor rejects the lease  we would be entitled to have the facility returned to us 
in that event  if we were unable to re lease the facility to a new operator on favorable terms or only after a significant delay  we could lose some or all of the associated revenue from that facility for an extended period of time  which could also result in impairment of the facility 
with respect to our mortgage loans  the imposition of an automatic stay under bankruptcy law could negatively impact our ability to foreclose or seek other remedies against a mortgagor 
generally  with respect to our mortgage loans  the imposition of an automatic stay under the bankruptcy code precludes us from exercising foreclosure or other remedies against the debtor without first obtaining stay relief from the bankruptcy court 
pre petition creditors generally do not have rights to the cash flows from the properties underlying the mortgages unless their security interest in the property includes such cash flows 
mortgagees may  however  receive periodic payments from the debtor mortgagors 
such payments are referred to as adequate protection payments 
the timing of adequate protection payments and whether the mortgagees are entitled to such payments depends on negotiating an acceptable settlement with the mortgagor subject to approval of the bankruptcy court or on the order of the bankruptcy court in the event a negotiated settlement cannot be achieved 
a mortgagee also is treated differently from a landlord in several respects 
the mortgagee s loan may be divided into a secured claim for the portion of the mortgage debt that does not exceed the value of the property securing the debt and a general unsecured claim for the portion of the mortgage debt that exceeds the value of the property 
a secured creditor such as our company is entitled to the recovery of interest and reasonable fees  costs and charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim arose only if  and to the extent that  the value of the collateral exceeds the amount owed 
if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt  interest as well as reasonable fees  costs  and charges are not necessarily required to be paid during the progress of the bankruptcy case  but they will accrue until confirmation of a plan of reorganization liquidation and are generally paid at confirmation or such other time as the court orders unless the debtor voluntarily makes a payment 
if the value of the collateral held by a secured creditor is less than the secured debt including such creditor s secured debt and the secured debt of any creditor with a more senior security interest in the collateral  interest on the loan for the time period between the filing of the case and confirmation may be disallowed 
finally  while a lease generally would either be assumed  assumed and assigned  or rejected with all of its benefits and burdens intact  the terms of a mortgage  including the rate of interest and the timing of principal payments  may be modified under certain circumstances if the debtor is able to effect a cram down under the bankruptcy code 
before such a cram down is allowed  the bankruptcy court must conclude that the treatment of the secured creditor s claim is fair and equitable 
if an operator files bankruptcy  our leases with the debtor could be re characterized as a financing agreement  which could negatively impact our rights under the lease 
another risk regarding our leases is that in an operator s bankruptcy the leases could be re characterized as a financing agreement 
in making such a determination  a bankruptcy court may consider certain factors  which may include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following whether rent is calculated to provide a return on investment rather than to compensate the lessor for loss  use and possession of the property  whether the property is purchased specifically for the lessee s use or whether the lessee selected  inspected  contracted for  and received the property  whether the transaction is structured solely to obtain tax advantages  whether the lessee is entitled to obtain ownership of the property at the expiration of the lease  and whether any option purchase price is unrelated to the value of the land  and whether the lessee assumed many of the obligations associated with outright ownership of the property  including responsibility for maintenance  repair  property taxes and insurance 
if an operator defaults under one of our mortgage loans  we may have to foreclose on the mortgage or protect our interest by acquiring title to the property and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the facility s investment potential 
operators may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies  seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies and or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations 
if an operator seeks bankruptcy protection  the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other remedies against the operator unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case 
high loan to value ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage loan upon foreclosure 

table of contents operators that fail to comply with the requirements of governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid  licensing and certification requirements  fraud and abuse regulations or new legislative developments may be unable to meet their obligations to us 
our operators are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes sometimes applied retroactively resulting from legislation  adoption of rules and regulations  and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law 
the ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot be predicted 
these changes may have a dramatic effect on our operators costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by both government and other third party payors 
the failure of any of our operators to comply with these laws  requirements and regulations could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us 
in particular medicare and medicaid 
a significant portion of our snf operators revenue is derived from governmentally funded reimbursement programs  primarily medicare and medicaid  and failure to maintain certification and accreditation in these programs would result in a loss of funding from such programs 
loss of certification or accreditation could cause the revenues of our operators to decline  potentially jeopardizing their ability to meet their obligations to us 
in that event  our revenues from those facilities could be reduced  which could in turn cause the value of our affected properties to decline 
state licensing and medicare and medicaid laws also require operators of nursing homes and assisted living facilities to comply with extensive standards governing operations 
federal and state agencies administering those laws regularly inspect such facilities and investigate complaints 
our operators and their managers receive notices of potential sanctions and remedies from time to time  and such sanctions have been imposed from time to time on facilities operated by them 
if they are unable to cure deficiencies  which have been identified or which are identified in the future  such sanctions may be imposed and if imposed may adversely affect our operators revenues  potentially jeopardizing their ability to meet their obligations to us 
licensing and certification 
our operators and facilities are subject to regulatory and licensing requirements of federal  state and local authorities and are periodically audited by them to confirm compliance 
failure to obtain licensure or loss or suspension of licensure would prevent a facility from operating or result in a suspension of reimbursement payments until all licensure issues have been resolved and the necessary licenses obtained or reinstated 
our snfs require governmental approval  in the form of a certificate of need that generally varies by state and is subject to change  prior to the addition or construction of new beds  the addition of services or certain capital expenditures 
some of our facilities may be unable to satisfy current and future certificate of need requirements and may for this reason be unable to continue operating in the future 
in such event  our revenues from those facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time or permanently 
fraud and abuse laws and regulations 
there are various extremely complex and largely uninterpreted federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals  relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers  including criminal provisions that prohibit filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment or certification under medicare and medicaid  or failing to refund overpayments or improper payments 
governments are devoting increasing attention and resources to anti fraud initiatives against healthcare providers 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of and the balanced budget act expanded the penalties for healthcare fraud  including broader provisions for the exclusion of providers from the medicare and medicaid programs 
furthermore  the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services in cooperation with other federal and state agencies continues to focus on the activities of snfs in certain states in which we have properties 
in addition  the federal false claims act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government s recovery 
because of these incentives  these so called whistleblower suits have become more frequent 
the violation of any of these laws or regulations by an operator may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties that could jeopardize that operator s ability to make lease or mortgage payments to us or to continue operating its facility

other laws that impact how our operators conduct their operations include federal and state laws designed to protect the confidentiality and security of patient health information  state and local licensure laws  laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices  and laws generally affecting our operators management of property and equipment and how our operators generally conduct their operations  such as fire  health and safety laws  and federal and state laws affecting assisted living facilities mandating quality of services and care  and quality of food service  resident rights including abuse and neglect laws and health standards set by the federal occupational safety and health administration 
we can not predict the effect additional costs to comply with these laws may have on the revenues of our operators  and thus their ability to meet their obligations to us 
legislative and regulatory developments 
each year  legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would affect major changes in the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  or medicare modernization act  which is one example of such legislation  was enacted in late the medicare reimbursement changes for the long term care industry under this act are limited to a temporary increase in the per diem amount paid to snfs for residents who have aids 
the significant expansion of other benefits for medicare beneficiaries under this act  such as the expanded prescription drug benefit  could result in financial pressures on the medicare program that might result in future legislative and regulatory changes with impacts for our operators 
other proposals under consideration include efforts by individual states to control costs by decreasing state medicaid reimbursements  efforts to improve quality of care and reduce medical errors throughout the health care industry and cost containment initiatives by public and private payors 
we cannot accurately predict whether any proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  what effect  if any  these proposals would have on operators and  thus  our business 
regulatory proposals and rules are released on an ongoing basis that may have major impacts on the healthcare system generally and the skilled nursing and long term care industries in particular 
our operators depend on reimbursement from governmental and other third party payors and reimbursement rates from such payors may be reduced 
changes in the reimbursement rate or methods of payment from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs  or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursements for services provided by our operators has in the past  and could in the future  result in a substantial reduction in our operators revenues and operating margins 
additionally  net revenue realizable under third party payor agreements can change after examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the claims settlement processes or as a result of post payment audits 
payors may disallow requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable or because additional documentation is necessary or because certain services were not covered or were not medically necessary 
there also continue to be new legislative and regulatory proposals that could impose further limitations on government and private payments to healthcare providers 
in some cases  states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance 
we cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be available for the services provided by our operators  which are currently being reimbursed by medicare  medicaid or private third party payors 
further limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity  financial condition and results of operations  which could cause the revenues of our operators to decline and potentially jeopardize their ability to meet their obligations to us 
our operators may be subject to significant legal actions that could subject them to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities  which may affect their ability to pay their lease and mortgage payments to us 
as is typical in the healthcare industry  our operators are often subject to claims that their services have resulted in resident injury or other adverse effects 
the insurance coverage maintained by our operators may not cover all claims made against them nor continue to be available at a reasonable cost  if at all 
in some states  insurance coverage for the risk of punitive damages arising from professional liability and general liability claims and or litigation may not  in certain cases  be available to operators due to state law prohibitions or limitations of availability 
as a result  our operators operating in these states may be liable for punitive damage awards that are either not covered or are in excess of their insurance policy limits 
we also believe that there has been  and will continue to be  an increase in governmental investigations of long term care providers  particularly in the area of medicare medicaid false claims  as well as an increase in enforcement actions resulting from these investigations 
insurance is not available to cover such losses 
any adverse determination in a legal proceeding or governmental investigation  whether currently asserted or arising in the future  could have a material adverse effect on an operator s financial condition 
if an operator is unable to obtain or maintain insurance coverage  if judgments are obtained in excess of the insurance coverage  if an operator is required to pay uninsured punitive damages  or if an operator is subject to an uninsurable government enforcement action  the operator could be exposed to substantial additional liabilities 

table of contents increased competition as well as increased operating costs have resulted in lower revenues for some of our operators and may affect the ability of our tenants to meet their payment obligations to us 
the healthcare industry is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future 
our operators are competing with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies  life care at home  community based service programs  retirement communities and convalescent centers 
we cannot be certain the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us 
our operators may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses and therefore affect their ability to pay their lease or mortgage payments 
the market for qualified nurses  healthcare professionals and other key personnel is highly competitive and our operators may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
increases in labor costs due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel incurred by our operators could affect their ability to pay their lease or mortgage payments 
this situation could be particularly acute in certain states that have enacted legislation establishing minimum staffing requirements 
risks related to us and our operations in addition to the operator related risks discussed above  there are a number of risks directly associated with us and our operations 
we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs  and if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital  we may not be able to make future investments necessary to grow our business or meet maturing commitments 
in order to qualify as a reit under the code  we are required  among other things  to distribute each year to our stockholders at least of our reit taxable income 
because of this distribution requirement  we may not be able to fund  from cash retained from operations  all future capital needs  including capital needs to make investments and to satisfy or refinance maturing commitments 
as a result  we rely on external sources of capital  including debt and equity financing 
if we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources  we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business  or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature  which could negatively affect the ratings of our debt and even  in extreme circumstances  affect our ability to continue operations 
our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control  including general market conditions and the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of the shares of our capital stock 
generally speaking  difficult capital market conditions in our industry during the past several years and our need to stabilize our portfolio have limited our access to capital 
while we currently have sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our obligations and commitments  we may not be in position to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities for growth in the event that we are unable to access the capital markets on a timely basis or we are only able to obtain financing on unfavorable terms 
our ability to raise capital through sales of equity is dependent  in part  on the market price of our common stock  and our failure to meet market expectations with respect to our business could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and limit our ability to sell equity 
as with other publicly traded companies  the availability of equity capital will depend  in part  on the market price of our common stock which  in turn  will depend upon various market conditions and other factors that may change from time to time including the extent of investor interest  the general reputation of reits and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities  including securities issued by other real estate based companies  our financial performance and that of our operators  the contents of analyst reports about us and the reit industry  
table of contents general stock and bond market conditions  including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities  which may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher annual yield from future distributions  our failure to maintain or increase our dividend  which is dependent  to a large part  on growth of funds from operations which in turn depends upon increased revenues from additional investments and rental increases  and other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in reit tax laws 
the market value of the equity securities of a reit is generally based upon the market s perception of the reit s growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash distributions 
our failure to meet the market s expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we are subject to risks associated with debt financing  which could negatively impact our business  limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to repay maturing debt 
financing for future investments and our maturing commitments may be provided by borrowings under our million revolving senior secured credit facility  as amended credit facility  private or public offerings of debt  the assumption of secured indebtedness  mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio or through joint ventures 
we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risks that our cash flow will be insufficient to make timely payments of interest  that we will be unable to refinance existing indebtedness and that the terms of refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 
if we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions  our cash flow may not be sufficient in all years to pay distributions to our stockholders and to repay all maturing debt 
furthermore  if prevailing interest rates  changes in our debt ratings or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase  which could reduce our profitability and the amount of dividends we are able to pay 
moreover  additional debt financing increases the amount of our leverage 
certain of our operators account for a significant percentage of our real estate investment and revenues 
at december   approximately of our real estate investments were operated by two public companies sun healthcare group  inc sun and advocat 
our largest private company operators by investment were communicare health services communicare  signature holding ii  llc  haven healthcare  guardian ltc management  inc  nexion health inc 
and essex healthcare corporation 
no other operator represents more than of our investments 
the three states in which we had our highest concentration of investments were ohio  florida and pennsylvania at december  for the year ended december   our revenues from operations totaled million  of which approximately million were from sun  million from advocat and million from communicare 
no other operator generated more than of our revenues from operations for the year ended december  the failure or inability of any of these operators to pay their obligations to us could materially reduce our revenues and net income  which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay and cause our stock price to decline 
unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of new properties could reduce our profitability 
our business strategy contemplates future acquisitions that may not prove to be successful 
for example  we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties  including contingent liabilities  or newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business 
if we agree to provide funding to enable healthcare operators to build  expand or renovate facilities on our properties and the project is not completed  we could be forced to become involved in the development to ensure completion or we could lose the property 
these costs may negatively affect our results of operations 

table of contents our assets may be subject to impairment charges 
we periodically  but not less than annually  evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators 
the judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions  operator performance and legal structure 
if we determine that a significant impairment has occurred  we would be required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and funds from operations in the period in which the write off occurs 
during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment loss associated with one facility for approximately million 
we may not be able to sell certain closed facilities for their book value 
from time to time  we close facilities and actively market such facilities for sale 
to the extent we are unable to sell these properties for our book value  we may be required to take a non cash impairment charge or loss on the sale  either of which would reduce our net income 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have substantial indebtedness and we may increase our indebtedness in the future 
as of december   we had total debt of approximately million  of which million consisted of borrowings under our credit facility  million of which consisted of our senior notes due  million of which consisted of our senior notes due and million of non recourse debt to us resulting from the consolidation of a variable interest entity vie in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  fin r 
our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders 
for example  it could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to holders of our capital stock  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  or to carry out other aspects of our business plan  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  or to carry out other aspects of our business plan  require us to pledge as collateral substantially all of our assets  require us to maintain certain debt coverage and financial ratios at specified levels  thereby reducing our financial flexibility  limit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise  expose us to fluctuations in interest rates  to the extent our borrowings bear variable rates of interests  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
our real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
all of our properties are special purpose properties that could not be readily converted to general residential  retail or office use 
healthcare facilities that participate in medicare or medicaid must meet extensive program requirements  including physical plant and operational requirements  which are revised from time to time 
such requirements may include a duty to admit medicare and medicaid patients  limiting the ability of the facility to increase its private pay census beyond certain limits 
medicare and medicaid facilities are regularly inspected to determine compliance and may be excluded from the programs in some cases without a prior hearing for failure to meet program requirements 
transfers of operations of nursing homes and other healthcare related facilities are subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate 
thus  if the operation of any of our properties becomes unprofitable due to competition  age of improvements or other factors such that our lessee or mortgagor becomes unable to meet its obligations on the lease or mortgage loan  the liquidation value of the property may be substantially less  particularly relative to the amount owing on any related mortgage loan  than would be the case if the property were readily adaptable to other uses 
the receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any federal  state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator with a new operator licensed to manage the facility 
in addition  certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment  such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment 
should such events occur  our income and cash flows from operations would be adversely affected 

table of contents as an owner or lender with respect to real property  we may be exposed to possible environmental liabilities 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner of real property or a secured lender  such as us  may be liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of  or related releases of  certain hazardous or toxic substances at  under or disposed of in connection with such property  as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances  including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence or disposal of such substances and liability may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of an operator of the property 
the cost of any required investigation  remediation  removal  fines or personal or property damages and the owner s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and or the assets of the owner 
in addition  the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances  may adversely affect our operators ability to attract additional residents  the owner s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which  in turn  would reduce the owner s revenues 
although our leases and mortgage loans require the lessee and the mortgagor to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities  the scope of such obligations may be limited 
for instance  most of our leases do not require the lessee to indemnify us for environmental liabilities arising before the lessee took possession of the premises 
further  we cannot assure you that any such mortgagor or lessee would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations 
the industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
this competition may prevent us from raising prices at the same pace as our costs increase 
we compete for additional healthcare facility investments with other healthcare investors  including other reits 
the operators of the facilities compete with other regional or local nursing care facilities for the support of the medical community  including physicians and acute care hospitals  as well as the general public 
some significant competitive factors for the placing of patients in skilled and intermediate care nursing facilities include quality of care  reputation  physical appearance of the facilities  services offered  family preferences  physician services and price 
if our cost of capital should increase relative to the cost of capital of our competitors  the spread that we realize on our investments may decline if competitive pressures limit or prevent us from charging higher lease or mortgage rates 
we are named as defendants in litigation arising out of professional liability and general liability claims relating to our previously owned and operated facilities that if decided against us  could adversely affect our financial condition 
we and several of our wholly owned subsidiaries have been named as defendants in professional liability and general liability claims related to our owned and operated facilities 
other third party managers responsible for the day to day operations of these facilities have also been named as defendants in these claims 
in these suits  patients of certain previously owned and operated facilities have alleged significant damages  including punitive damages  against the defendants 
the lawsuits are in various stages of discovery and we are unable to predict the likely outcome at this time 
we continue to vigorously defend these claims and pursue all rights we may have against the managers of the facilities  under the terms of the management agreements 
we have insured these matters  subject to self insured retentions of various amounts 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our defense of these matters or in asserting our claims against various managers of the subject facilities or that the amount of any settlement or judgment will be substantially covered by insurance or that any punitive damages will be covered by insurance 
we are subject to significant anti takeover provisions 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain various procedural and other requirements which could make it difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
our board of directors is divided into three classes and the members of our board of directors are elected for terms that are staggered 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to fix the preferences  rights and limitations of the preferred stock without stockholder approval 
we have also adopted a stockholders rights plan which provides for share purchase rights to become exercisable at a discount if a person or group announces a tender or exchange offer for our common stock or acquires a significant amount of our common stock 
these provisions could discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us  which could adversely affect the market price of our securities 

table of contents we may change our investment strategies and policies and capital structure 
our board of directors  without the approval of our stockholders  may alter our investment strategies and policies if it determines in the future that a change is in our stockholders best interests 
the methods of implementing our investment strategies and policies may vary as new investments and financing techniques are developed 
if we fail to maintain our reit status  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we were organized to qualify for taxation as a reit under sections through of the code 
we believe that we have been organized and operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the code and intend to continue to operate in a manner that will maintain our qualification as a reit 
we entered into a closing agreement with the irs in december resolving certain issues in a manner that did not  and will not in the future  adversely affect our qualification for taxation as a reit as discussed under the heading taxation resolution of related party tenant issue in item above 
qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements  some on an annual and some on a quarterly basis  established under highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involve the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
we cannot assure you that we will at all times satisfy these rules and tests 
if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  as a result of a determination that we failed to meet the annual distribution requirement or otherwise  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates with respect to each such taxable year for which the statute of limitations remains open 
moreover  unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 
this treatment would significantly reduce our net earnings and cash flow because of our additional tax liability for the years involved  which could significantly impact our financial condition 
we generally must distribute annually at least of our taxable income to our stockholders to maintain our reit status 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least  but less than of our reit taxable income  as adjusted  we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates 
even if we remain qualified as a reit  we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 
even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and assets  including taxes on any undistributed income  tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure  and state or local income  property and transfer taxes 
any of these taxes would decrease cash available for the payment of our debt obligations 
in addition  we may derive income through trs  which will then be subject to corporate level income tax at regular rates 
complying with reit requirements may affect our profitability 
to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the nature and diversification of our assets  the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders 
thus we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments from our portfolio in order to satisfy the asset and income tests or to qualify under certain statutory relief provisions 
we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution eg  if we have assets which generate mismatches between taxable income and available cash 
then  having to comply with the distribution requirement could cause us to i sell assets in adverse market conditions  ii borrow on unfavorable terms  or iii distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions  capital expenditures or repayment of debt 
as a result  satisfying the reit requirements could have an adverse effect on our business results and profitability 
we depend upon our key employees and may be unable to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified personnel 
our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive management team and other key employees 
accordingly  our future success depends on our ability to attract  hire  train and retain highly skilled management and other qualified personnel 
competition for qualified employees is intense  and we compete for qualified employees with companies that may have greater financial resources than we have 
our employment agreements with our executive officers provide that their employment may be terminated by either party at any time 
consequently  we may not be successful in attracting  hiring  and training and retaining the people we need  which would seriously impede our ability to implement our business strategy 

table of contents in the event we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls  or if these internal controls over financial reporting are not effective  our business could suffer 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires companies to do a comprehensive evaluation of their internal controls 
as a result  each year we evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls and our auditor can publicly attest to this certification 
our efforts to comply with section and related regulations regarding our management s required assessment of internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors attestation of that assessment has required  and continues to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
if for any period our management is unable to ascertain the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our auditors cannot attest to management s certification  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our stock the market value of our stock could be substantially affected by various factors 
the share price of our stock will depend on many factors  which may change from time to time  including the market for similar securities issued by reits  changes in estimates by analysts  our ability to meet analysts estimates  general economic and financial market conditions  and our financial condition  performance and prospects 
our issuance of additional capital stock  warrants or debt securities  whether or not convertible  may reduce the market price for our shares 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sale of our capital stock  warrants or debt securities  or the availability of our securities for future sale  will have on the market price of our shares  including our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or preferred shares  warrants or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price of our stock and the terms upon which we may obtain additional equity financing in the future 
in addition  we may issue additional capital stock in the future to raise capital or as a result of the following the issuance and exercise of options to purchase our common stock 
we have in the past and may in the future issue additional options or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock under remuneration plans 
we may also issue options or convertible securities to our employees in lieu of cash bonuses or to our directors in lieu of director s fees 
the issuance of shares pursuant to our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
the issuance of debt securities exchangeable for our common stock 
the exercise of warrants we may issue in the future 
lenders sometimes ask for warrants or other rights to acquire shares in connection with providing financing 
we cannot assure you that our lenders will not request such rights 
there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
in  our board of directors suspended dividends on our common stock and all series of preferred stock in an effort to generate cash to address then impending debt maturities 
in  we paid all accrued but unpaid dividends on all series of preferred stock and reinstated dividends on our common stock and all series of preferred stock 
however  our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected if any of the risks described above were to occur 
our payment of dividends is subject to compliance with restrictions contained in our credit facility  the indenture relating to our outstanding senior notes due  the indenture relating to our outstanding senior notes due and our preferred stock 
all dividends will be paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our reit status and such other factors as our board may deem relevant from time to time 
there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
in addition  our dividends in the past have included  and may in the future include  a return of capital 

table of contents holders of our outstanding preferred stock have liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to designate and issue preferred stock that may have dividend  liquidation and other rights that are senior to those of our common stock 
as of the date of this filing   shares of our series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock were issued and outstanding 
the aggregate liquidation preference with respect to this outstanding preferred stock is approximately million  and annual dividends on our outstanding preferred stock are approximately million 
holders of our preferred stock are generally entitled to cumulative dividends before any dividends may be declared or set aside on our common stock 
upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation  dissolution or winding up  before any payment is made to holders of our common stock  holders of our preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of per share with respect to the series d preferred stock  plus any accrued and unpaid distributions 
this will reduce the remaining amount of our assets  if any  available to distribute to holders of our common stock 
in addition  holders of our preferred stock have the right to elect two additional directors to our board of directors if six quarterly preferred dividends are in arrears 
legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect purchasers of our stock 
in recent years  numerous legislative  judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of the federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our stock 
changes are likely to continue to occur in the future  and we cannot assure you that any of these changes will not adversely affect our stockholder s stock 
any of these changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on market value or resale potential 
stockholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisor with respect to the impact that recent legislation may have on their investment and the status of legislative  regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect

taxes as more fully disclosed under taxation resolution of related party tenant issue in item above  during the fourth quarter of  we identified a related party tenant issue with one of our operators  advocat  that could have been interpreted as affecting our compliance with federal income tax rules applicable to reits regarding related party tenant income 
as a result of the related party tenant issue  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in during the fourth quarter of  we restructured our agreement with advocat and have been advised by tax counsel that we will not receive a nonqualfying related party income from advocat in future periods 
as a result of the restructured agreement  we do not expect to incur tax expense associated related party tenant income in periods commencing after january  during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a closing agreement with the irs for the tax years in  we recorded thousand of tax credit related to resolving interest and penalties for the tax years so long as we qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on the reit taxable income that we distribute to stockholders  subject to certain exceptions

funds from operations our funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo  for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the same period in 
table of contents we calculate and report ffo in accordance with the definition and interpretive guidelines issued by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  and  consequently  ffo is defined as net income available to common stockholders  adjusted for the effects of asset dispositions and certain non cash items  primarily depreciation and amortization 
we believe that ffo is an important supplemental measure of our operating performance 
because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land  such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  while real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
the term ffo was designed by the real estate industry to address this issue 
ffo herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo of other reits that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from us 
we use ffo as one of several criteria to measure the operating performance of our business 
we further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits 
we offer this measure to assist the users of our financial statements in evaluating our financial performance under gaap  and ffo should not be considered a measure of liquidity  an alternative to net income or an indicator of any other performance measure determined in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on this measure as a substitute for any gaap measure  including net income

year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues our operating revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of million over the same period in the million increase was primarily a result of new investments made throughout and the increase in operating revenues from new investments was partially offset by a reduction in mortgage interest income and one time contractual interest revenue associated with the payoff of a mortgage during the first quarter of detailed changes in operating revenues for the year ended december  are as follows rental income was million  an increase of million over the same period in the increase was due to new leases entered into throughout and  as well as rental revenue from the consolidation of a variable interest entity 
mortgage interest income totaled million  a decrease of million over the same period in the decrease was primarily the result of normal amortization  a million loan payoff that occurred in the first quarter of and a million loan payoff that occurred in the second quarter of other investment income totaled million  an increase of million over the same period in the primary reason for the increase was due to dividends and accretion income associated with the advocat securities

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of approximately million over the same period in the increase was primarily due to million of increased depreciation expense  million of incremental restricted stock expense and a million provision for uncollectible notes receivable  partially offset by a leasehold termination expense for million

table of contents taxes during the fourth quarter of  we determined that certain terms of the advocat series b non voting  redeemable convertible preferred stock held by us could be interpreted as affecting our compliance with federal income tax rules applicable to reits regarding related party tenant income 
as such  advocat  one of our lessees  may be deemed to be a related party tenant under applicable federal income tax rules 
in such event  our rental income from advocat would not be qualifying income under the gross income tests that are applicable to reits 
in order to maintain qualification as a reit  we annually must satisfy certain tests regarding the source of our gross income 
the applicable federal income tax rules provide a savings clause for reits that fail to satisfy the reit gross income tests if such failure is due to reasonable cause 
a reit that qualifies for the savings clause will retain its reit status but will pay a tax under section b and related interest 
on december   we submitted to the irs a request for a closing agreement to resolve the related party tenant issue 
as a result of the related party tenant issue associated with advocat  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million  for the year ended december  and  respectively

table of contents dividends in order to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain  and ii of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus b the sum of certain items of non cash income 
in addition  if we dispose of any built in gain asset during a recognition period  we will be required to distribute at least of the built in gain after tax  if any  recognized on the disposition of such asset 
such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration 
in addition  such distributions are required to be made pro rata  with no preference to any share of stock as compared with other shares of the same class  and with no preference to one class of stock as compared with another class except to the extent that such class is entitled to such a preference 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least  but less than of our reit taxable income  as adjusted  we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates

liquidity we believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital  including cash from operations  our existing availability under our credit facility and expected proceeds from mortgage payoffs are more than adequate to finance operations  meet recurring debt service requirements and fund future investments through the next twelve months 
we regularly review our liquidity needs  the adequacy of cash flow from operations  and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring expenses  debt service payments  preferred stock dividends  common stock dividends  and growth through acquisitions of additional properties 
the primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations 
operating cash flows have historically been determined by i the number of facilities we lease or have mortgages on  ii rental and mortgage rates  iii our debt service obligations  and iv general and administrative expenses 
the timing  source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment  especially to changes in interest rates 
changes in the capital markets environment may impact the availability of cost effective capital and affect our plans for acquisition and disposition activity 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of december   a increase of million as compared to the balance at december  the following is a discussion of changes in cash and cash equivalents due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows

investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities was an outflow of million for the year ended december   as compared to an outflow of million for the same period in the decrease in cash outflow from investing activities of million relates primarily to the timing of acquisitions completed in compared to for the year ended december   we acquired real estate  primarily snfs and one independent living center from litchfield for million 
for the year ended december   we purchased five snfs from litchfield for million 
in  we sold shares of sun s common stock for approximately million in proceeds 

table of contents financing activities net cash flow from financing activities was an outflow of million for year ended december  as compared to an inflow of million for the same period in the million change in financing cash flow was a result of a net payment of million on our credit facility and other borrowings during the twelve months of as compared to net proceeds of million for the same period in  an increase in dividend payments of million as compared to the same period in  and the reduction in proceeds from the optional cash purchase portion of the drspp of million as compared to the same period in  offset by proceeds of million from a common stock offering in the second quarter of  the proceeds of which were used to repay borrowing under our credit facility 
we used a majority of the proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility to acquire properties from litchfield 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified four significant accounting policies that we believe are critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant assumptions  judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  we believe the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the four critical accounting policies are revenue recognition we have various different investments that generate revenue  including leased and mortgaged properties  as well as  other investments  including working capital loans 
we recognized rental income and mortgage interest income and other investment income as earned over the terms of the related master leases and notes  respectively 
substantially all of our leases contain provisions for specified annual increases over the rents of the prior year and are generally computed in one of three methods depending on specific provisions of each lease as follows i a specific annual increase over the prior year s rent  generally  ii an increase based on the change in pre determined formulas from year to year ie  such as increases in the cpi  or iii specific dollar increases over prior years 
revenue under lease arrangements with specific determinable increases is recognized over the term of the lease on a straight line basis 
sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements does not provide for the recognition of contingent revenue until all possible contingencies have been eliminated 
we consider the operating history of the lessee  the payment history  the general condition of the industry and various other factors when evaluating whether all possible contingencies have been eliminated 
we have historically not included  and generally expect in the future not to include  contingent rents as income until received 
in the case of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis  we generally record reserves against earned revenues from leases when collection becomes questionable or when negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators result in significant uncertainty regarding ultimate collection 
the amount of the reserve is estimated based on what management believes will likely be collected 
we continually evaluate the collectability of our straight line rent assets 
if it appears that we will not collect future rent due under our leases  we will record a provision for loss related to the straight line rent asset 
recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results may cause recognized revenue exceeding contractual amounts due from our tenants 
such cumulative excess amounts are included in accounts receivable and were million and million  net of allowances  at december  and  respectively 

table of contents gains on sales of real estate assets are recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the recognition of the sale and the related gain is measured against the various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement associated with the assets sold 
to the extent the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition until the sales criteria are met 
depreciation and asset impairment under gaap  real estate assets are stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value  if deemed impaired 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of to years for buildings and improvements and three to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
management periodically  but not less than annually  evaluates our real estate investments for impairment indicators  including the evaluation of our assets useful lives 
the judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as  but not limited to  market conditions  operator performance and legal structure 
if indicators of impairment are present  management evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying facilities 
provisions for impairment losses related to long lived assets are recognized when expected future undiscounted cash flows are determined to be permanently less than the carrying values of the assets 
an adjustment is made to the net carrying value of the leased properties and other long lived assets for the excess of historical cost over fair value 
the fair value of the real estate investment is determined by market research  which includes valuing the property as a nursing home as well as other alternative uses 
all impairments are taken as a period cost at that time  and depreciation is adjusted going forward to reflect the new value assigned to the asset 
if we decide to sell rental properties or land holdings  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from estimated net sales proceeds  the property is written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell 
our estimates of cash flows and fair values of the properties are based on current market conditions and consider matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties  recent sales data for comparable properties  and  where applicable  contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers 
for the years ended december    and  we recognized impairment losses of million  million and million  respectively  including amounts classified within discontinued operations 
loan impairment management  periodically but not less than annually  evaluates our outstanding loans and notes receivable 
when management identifies potential loan impairment indicators  such as non payment under the loan documents  impairment of the underlying collateral  financial difficulty of the operator or other circumstances that may impair full execution of the loan documents  and management believes it is probable that all amounts will not be collected under the contractual terms of the loan  the loan is written down to the present value of the expected future cash flows 
in cases where expected future cash flows are not readily determinable  the loan is written down to the fair value of the collateral 
the fair value of the loan is determined by market research  which includes valuing the property as a nursing home as well as other alternative uses 
we recorded loan impairments of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we currently account for impaired loans using the cost recovery method applying cash received against the outstanding principal balance prior to recording interest income see note other investments 
at december  and  we had allowances for loan losses of million on two working capital notes 
assets held for sale and discontinued operations pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the operating results of specified real estate assets that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for disposition as defined by sfas no 
 are reflected as assets held for sale in our balance sheet 
assets that qualify as held for sale may also be considered as a discontinued operation if  a the operation and cash flows of the asset have been or will be eliminated from future operations and b we will not have significant involvement with the asset after its disposition 
for assets that qualify as discontinued operations  we have reclassified the operations of those assets to discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented and assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet for all periods presented 

table of contents for the year ended december   we had three assets held for sale with a combined net book value of million 
discontinued operations includes the revenue of million and expense of thousand for facilities 
it also includes the gain of million on the sale of six snfs and two alfs 
for the year ended december   we had seven assets held for sale with a combined net book value of million  which includes a reclassification of one asset with a net book value of million that was reclassified as held for sale and discontinued operations during discontinued operations includes revenue of million and expense of million and a gain of million on the sale of three snfs and one alf 
for the year ended december   we had nine assets held for sale with a net book value of approximately million  which includes a reclassification of five assets with a net book value of million that were sold or reclassified as held for sale and discontinued operations during and one asset with a net book value of million that was reclassified as held for sale and discontinued operations during discontinued operations includes revenue of million and expense of million and a gain of million on the sale of eight snfs  six alfs and acres of undeveloped land 
effects of recently issued accounting standards fin evaluation on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 by defining a criterion that an individual tax position must meet for any part of that position to be recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
the interpretation requires a review of all tax positions accounted for in accordance with fasb statement no 
and applies a more likely than not recognition threshold 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
we are subject to the provisions of fin beginning january  we evaluated fin and determined that the adoption of fin had no impact on our financial statements 
fas evaluation in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements fas no 

this standard defines fair value  establishes a methodology for measuring fair value and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements 
fas no 
emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
fas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and we intend to adopt the standard on january  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that fas no 
will have on our financial statements 
fas evaluation in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with the change in unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected and reported in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
fas r evaluation on december   the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
r  business combinations fas r 
the new standard will significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business combination transactions 
fas r requires companies to recognize  with certain exception  percent of the fair value of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and non controlling interest in acquisitions of less than a percent controlling interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control  measure acquirer shares issued as consideration for a business combination at fair value on the date of the acquisition  recognize contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair value  with subsequent change in fair value generally reflected in earnings  recognition of reacquisition loss and gain contingencies at their acquisition date fair value  expense as incurred  acquisition related transaction costs 
fas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is prohibited 
we intend to adopt the standard on january  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that fas r will have on our financial statements 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  but we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the term of new investments with new long term fixed rate borrowing to the extent possible 
the following disclosures of estimated fair value of financial instruments are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number of important assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows  risks  discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument 
the use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts 
accordingly  the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange 
mortgage notesreceivable the fair value of mortgage notes receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities 
notesreceivable the fair value of notes receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities 
borrowings under lines of credit arrangement the carrying amount approximates fair value because the borrowings are interest rate adjustable 
senior unsecured notes the fair value of the senior unsecured notes is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current borrowing rate available for the similar debt 
the market value of our long term fixed rate borrowings and mortgages is subject to interest rate risks 
generally  the market value of fixed rate financial instruments will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
the estimated fair value of our total long term borrowings at december  was approximately million 
a one percent increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of long term borrowings by approximately million at december  the estimated fair value of our total long term borrowings at december  was approximately million  and a one percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of long term borrowings by approximately million 
while we currently do not engage in hedging strategies  we may engage in such strategies in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies
