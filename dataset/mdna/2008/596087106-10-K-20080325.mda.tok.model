item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed discussion of our research and development expenses 
in the event that we are unable to raise additional capital  we may be forced to discontinue or alter our development programs 
pulsatile product candidates we intend to develop the pulsatile drugs listed above and those in preclinical development  with the intention of incorporating one or more of the following improvements once a day formulation lower dose shorter duration of therapy reduced side effect profile combination product with superior efficacy over either product alone improved pediatric dosage form currently  our drug product candidates primarily represent improved versions of approved and marketed drugs  either delivered alone or in combination with other drugs 
since these existing drugs have already been approved for marketing by the fda  we anticipate being able to rely  in part  on the fda s prior findings on the safety and or efficacy of these existing drugs in seeking fda approval of our pulsys products 
for example  based on meetings with the fda regarding the study program for our amoxicillin products  we filed our new drug application via the b regulatory pathway for our moxatag product  which  in part  relied on the fda s prior findings regarding the safety and efficacy of amoxicillin 
keflex cephalexin pulsys we are developing a once daily pulsys version of keflex  our first generation oral cephalosporin antibiotic 
our intent is to develop a once daily keflex pulsys for uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections 
currently  keflex or  in its generic form  cephalexin is the antibiotic most frequently prescribed by physicians in the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections 
most commonly  keflex is prescribed mg three times per day for a period of ten days 
we believe a once daily version of keflex pulsys may represent a substantial market opportunity 
in  cephalexin  the active ingredient in keflex  was the third most prescribed antibiotic in the united states  with approximately million prescriptions ims national prescription audit 
assuming branded retail pricing of per prescription  we estimate that the cephalexin market opportunity has a value of approximately million 
we have completed a total of six keflex pulsys phase i clinical studies  evaluating various pulsatile formulations of keflex dosed in a total of more than healthy volunteer subjects 
based on the results from our phase i studies  we believe we have finalized the formulation development phase i program for our keflex pulsys product candidate 
on june   we completed a meeting with the fda s division of anti infective and ophthalmology products to discuss our phase iii trial and regulatory strategy to support product approval for keflex pulsys for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections usssis in adults and adolescents due to susceptible staphylococcus aureus and or streptococcus pyogenes 
we believe our planned non inferiority phase iii clinical trial design and regulatory strategy for keflex pulsys were acceptable to the fda 
our anticipated phase iii trial is designed as a two arm  double blind  non inferiority trial with a minimum enrollment of patients 
we expect to compare our milligram keflex pulsys product administered once daily for days to milligrams of keflex dosed four times daily  for a total daily dose of milligrams  for days 
these forward looking statements are based on information available to us at this time 
actual results could differ because our trial results could be delayed or unsuccessful or due to delays in fda approval  which may never occur 
our once daily keflex pulsys product candidate is designed to increase the convenience of cephalexin therapy  which is currently dosed two to four times daily for a period of seven to days 
cephalexin is commonly prescribed as a first line therapy for common uncomplicated skin infections such as impetigo skin lesions  simple skin abscesses  and cellulitis acute inflammation of connective tissue of the skin 
there is currently no once daily cephalexin product approved for marketing in the united states 
amoxicillin pediatric pharyngitis program we have developed two amoxicillin pulsys formulations  our moxatag tablet approved for adults and pediatric patients age and older and a pediatric sprinkle 
our pediatric sprinkle product utilizes a similar formulation to the adult product  however  it is dosed in multiparticulate granules designed to be sprinkled over food 
survey results from patients and caregivers utilizing our pediatric sprinkle product suggest that its convenience and transportability may be beneficial features of our sprinkle formulation  and we expect to utilize our sprinkle presentation as the method of dosing our amoxicillin pediatric product 
we believe the market opportunity for a pediatric strep throat product is substantial  as more than half of the strep throat market is believed to be represented by pediatric patients 
in  we concluded a phase iii clinical trial evaluating once daily amoxicillin pulsys in pediatric patients with pharyngitis tonsillitis strep throat which failed to achieve its desired clinical endpoints 
however  we believe there is potential for us to pursue a pulsatile version of amoxicillin for the treatment of pediatric patients with strep throat through a redesigned clinical trial program 
in  we completed a phase i study evaluating the observed drug concentrations from various pulsatile sprinkle amoxicillin formulations in healthy volunteer subjects 
based on the results from the study along with our phase i studies  we intend to evaluate the safety and efficacy of various daily doses and durations of treatment for our pediatric amoxicillin pulsys product candidate in a phase ii study  should we have sufficient capital and other resources to do so 
as part of our fda approval of moxatag on january   in adults and pediatric patients years and older and in accordance with the requirements of the pediatric research equity act  we received from the fda a deferral to further evaluate our product candidate for pediatric patients less than years of age with pharyngitis and or tonsillitis as part of a post marketing commitment 
should the results of the phase ii study support proceeding into phase iii  we may design and conduct a phase iii trial in this population 
we agreed to submit a completed study report and data set for moxatag in pediatric patients less than years old within the next five years as part of this commitment 
if the results of the phase ii study do not support proceeding into phase iii  we may file a request for a waiver for the assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the product in this population 
other possible pulsatile product candidates our current focus is on the antibiotic product candidates that include amoxicillin and keflex 
we have also identified additional product candidates which we believe could be developed for delivery in a pulsatile manner 
the timing of further development work on these candidates depends on our financial and other resources as well as our evaluation of the commercial potential of the products 
pulsys preclinical development programs we have identified several additional opportunities to apply pulsys technology to develop individual and combination antibiotic products which we believe could have application against the following indications sinusitis chronic bronchitis acute otitis media urinary tract infections community acquired methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa 
we have conducted preclinical studies evaluating the bacterial killing efficiency of several antibiotics and antibiotic combinations dosed in a pulsatile manner 
based on these studies  along with the consultation of our scientific advisors  we believe we may be able to utilize our pulsys technology in the creation of antibiotic product candidates that target some of the most common uses of antibiotics 
these uses include sinusitis  chronic bronchitis  acute otitis media  urinary tract infections  and community acquired methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa 
we have currently placed all of these development programs on hold  and any plans for additional studies regarding these  or any other possible product candidates  will be dependent on our ability to raise sufficient capital to fund these types of studies 
we may also explore the use of our pulsatile dosing approach beyond antibiotics to other therapeutic categories  such as antivirals and antifungals  in the event that we have sufficient financial and other resources to do so 
although we have not tested the effectiveness of pulsatile dosing for these applications  we believe that our approach may yield benefits similar to those we have found for the treatment of bacterial infections 
patent and intellectual property protection our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  to protect trade secrets  to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we seek to protect our proprietary position by  among other methods  filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
further  all of our employees have executed agreements assigning to us all rights to any inventions and processes they develop while they are employed by us 
in addition  we may use license agreements to access external products and technologies  as well as to convey our own intellectual property to others 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
protection of our intellectual property rights is subject to a number of risks 
number of patents 
we currently own issued us patents  pending us patent applications and issued foreign patents 
our issued patents cover certain compositions and methods using pulsatile dosing 
we also own foreign filed patent applications  which correspond to our us patents and applications 
we also own four international pct patent applications  each of which international pct patent applications we anticipate converting into several individually foreign filed patent applications to further correspond to our us patents and applications 
multi level patent strategy for pulsys 
we have implemented a multi level patent strategy in order to protect our approved and potential future pulsatile drug products 
the first level is composed of umbrella patents and patent applications to protect the pulsys administration of general classes of anti infective drugs  such as antibiotics  antivirals  antifungals and anti cancer 
the umbrella patents cover all drugs in class  once a day dosing  and all methods of dosing 
the second level is composed of sub umbrella patents and patent applications  protecting the pulsys administration of subclasses of drugs  such as beta lactam antibiotics with enzyme inhibitors 
the third level includes patents and applications for specific anti infective agents 
we intend to continue to use and enhance this strategy in order to protect our intellectual property 
expiration dates for key patents 
our general pulsys antibiotic patents were issued in and  and will continue to run for a number of years 
the earliest patent expiration is in october no royalties on pulsys patents 
we have developed all of our pulsys technology in house  and we have retained full ownership of the related patents 
thus  we owe no royalties to any third party for utilizing the pulsys technology in our products 
sales and marketing we received marketing approval for keflex mg capsules from the fda in may in june  we entered into marketing agreements with innovex  the commercialization division of quintiles transnational corporation  to provide us contract sales and marketing services for the promotion of keflex mg capsules 
we launched keflex mg capsules in july we currently have a targeted and dedicated national contract sales force of approximately sales representatives and three middlebrook district sales managers promoting keflex mg capsules to high prescribing physicians across the us we are also selling keflex mg capsules and mg capsules  however  we do not actively promote those keflex strengths as their markets are dominated by generic equivalents 
we are currently focusing our sales and marketing initiatives solely on the promotion of keflex mg capsules in an effort to maximize the impact from what we believe to be our most significant keflex market opportunity 
we also have a small marketing staff supporting our sales of the keflex brand of cephalexin 
the selling and marketing of keflex mg capsules is a substantial financial commitment for our company 
as a result  we may consider alternative commercialization strategies for our keflex mg capsules in in an effort to reduce the financial resources required to market the product and or to maximize the profit derived from the product 
keflex is primarily sold directly to pharmaceutical wholesalers 
in the pharmaceutical industry there are a limited number of major wholesalers responsible for the majority of sales 
product sales of keflex to cardinal health inc  mckesson corporation  and amerisourcebergen corporation represented approximately percent of our net revenue from keflex in we believe that a significant percentage of prescriptions for first line  broad spectrum antibiotics is written by high volume prescribers who can be reached by a community based sales force 
over time  and if we are successful in obtaining sufficient capital  we may expand our sales and marketing capabilities to provide greater support of our target audience 
we may also enter into agreements with other parties to capitalize on their sales and marketing capabilities in order to optimally market our products 
we currently manage the distribution of our keflex products  including warehousing and shipping  through integrated commercialization solutions  a division of amerisourcebergen corporation 
if we successfully develop and receive regulatory approval to market additional product candidates  we believe we will have to substantially expand our sales and marketing capabilities and or enter into partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies to successfully commercialize our product candidates 
we will need to successfully recruit additional sales and marketing personnel and build our sales and marketing infrastructure to successfully commercialize moxatag and any additional products or product candidates that we develop  acquire or license 
additional financial resources would be required to expand our current sales and marketing capabilities 
our future profitability will depend in part on our ability to develop additional sales and marketing capabilities to commercialize our future products to our target audiences 
competition the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and characterized by a number of established  large pharmaceutical companies  as well as smaller emerging companies 
our main competitors are large pharmaceutical companies  such as pfizer  glaxosmithkline  wyeth  bristol myers squibb  merck  johnson johnson  roche  schering plough  novartis  sanofi aventis  abbott laboratories  astrazeneca  and bayer  that may develop new drug compounds that render our drugs obsolete or noncompetitive 
smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialty pharmaceutical companies engaged in focused research and development of anti infective drugs  such as trimeris  vertex  adams respiratory therapeutics acquired by reckitt benckiser  gilead sciences  cubist  basilea  replidyne  intermune  oscient  king  advanced life sciences  and others 
drug delivery companies  such as johnson johnson s alza division  biovail  depomed  flamel technologies  and skyepharma  which may develop a dosing regimen that is more effective than pulsatile dosing 
generic drug companies  such as teva  ranbaxy  ivax  sandoz and stada  which produce low cost versions of antibiotics that may contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our pulsys product candidates 
there are many approved antibiotics available to treat bacterial conditions in the united states 
our marketed keflex products  our approved moxatag product  and products that are in development  will compete with other available products based primarily on efficacy safety tolerability acceptance by doctors patient compliance and acceptance patent protection convenience price insurance and other reimbursement coverage distribution marketing adaptability to various modes of dosing 
our keflex brand of cephalexin faces significant competition from generic distributors of cephalexin capsules and suspension 
currently  a significant portion of the prescriptions written for our keflex mg and mg capsules are substituted at the pharmacy with generic versions of keflex  supplied through leading generic drug manufacturers including teva  stada  ivax  ranbaxy  and others 
in addition  our keflex mg capsules are not covered by patent protection and thus would be subject to similar competition from generic versions of keflex mg capsules if and when generic drug manufacturers decide to pursue the manufacture and marketing approvals required for a generic mg strength cephalexin product 
in some instances  our novel products that utilize our pulsys technology may compete against non pulsatile drug products that share the same active ingredient  but are less convenient or require more cumbersome administration schedules 
a number of these non pulsatile drug products are available in generic form  which are usually substantially less expensive than the branded version 
companies such as teva  ranbaxy  ivax  sandoz and stada  and others are major manufacturers and distributors of generic versions of antibiotics with whom we may compete in the future 
new developments  including the development of methods of preventing the incidence of disease  such as vaccines  occur rapidly in the pharmaceutical industry 
these developments may render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
many of our competitors possess greater financial  managerial and technical resources and have established reputations for successfully developing and marketing drugs  all of which put us at a competitive disadvantage 
our competitors may be able to apply their resources and capabilities to develop and commercialize products that have distinct  enhanced  or perceived advantages versus our products 
the competitors may be in a position to devote greater resources in the sales  marketing  and distribution of these products and therefore considerably impact our ability to successfully commercialize our own products 
manufacturing we currently rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials  and to produce sufficient quantities of commercial supplies of our marketed products 
we believe that our initial focus on the production of improved formulations of approved and marketed drugs will reduce the risk and time involved in the development of manufacturing capabilities because production of these drugs involves well established and well accepted manufacturing techniques and processes 
we intend to continue to rely upon third party contract manufacturers for production of our clinical and commercial supplies for beta lactam products and product candidates 
the use of third parties for these activities allows us to minimize our initial capital investment and reduce the risk that would be associated with the establishment of our own commercial manufacturing and distribution operations 
with the possible transition to non beta lactam product candidates  we anticipate that our pilot facility could satisfy our drug production needs for clinical supplies through at least phase ii and  in some cases  through phase iii clinical trials 
in december  we entered into a commercial supply agreement with ceph international corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of patheon s mova pharmaceutical corporation  to secure a long term supply for our keflex brand of products 
this agreement provides for commercial supply of our keflex product beyond the transitional period agreed to by eli lilly as part of our june acquisition 
in april  we entered into agreements under which stada production ireland limited spi  previously known as the manufacturing division of clonmel healthcare limited  a subsidiary of stada arzneimittel ag  will provide us with commercial supply of our moxatag products 
spi has capacity in place to cover current projected needs for an initial commercial phase  with additional capacity for growth 
in addition to commercial supply  middlebrook and spi have also finalized an agreement for technology transfer  clinical stability batches and commercial scale up and validation  as well as an agreement covering middlebrook funded facility build out and equipment additions to support the commercial manufacturing program 
in connection with our manufacturing activities  we generate hazardous waste 
we are subject to federal and state regulation regarding the disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous waste 
we may incur costs to comply with such regulations now or in the future 
collaboration agreements we currently have no active collaboration agreements 
we have previously been a party to collaborations with gsk and with par pharmaceuticals 
termination of our collaboration with par pharmaceutical for amoxicillin pulsys in may  we entered into an agreement with par pharmaceutical to collaborate in the further development and commercialization of a pulsys based amoxicillin product 
under the terms of the agreement  we conducted the development program  including the manufacture of clinical supplies and the conduct of clinical trials  and were responsible for obtaining regulatory approval for the product 
we were to own the product trademark and to manufacture or arrange for supply of the product for commercial sales 
par was to be the sole distributor of the product 
both parties were to share commercialization expenses  including pre marketing costs and promotion costs  on an equal basis 
operating profits from sales of the product were also to be shared on an equal basis 
under the agreement  we received an upfront fee of million and a commitment from par to fund all further development expenses 
development expenses incurred by us were to be partially funded by quarterly payments aggregating million over the period of july through october  of which up to million was contingently refundable 
on august   we were notified by par of its decision to terminate the amoxicillin pulsys collaboration agreement 
under certain circumstances  the termination clauses of the agreement may entitle par to receive a share of net profits up to one half of their million funding of the development of certain amoxicillin pulsys products  should a product covered by the agreement be successfully commercialized 
accordingly  we retained deferred revenue of million related to the agreement 
termination of the collaboration with glaxosmithkline in july  we entered into a license agreement with glaxosmithkline gsk pursuant to which we licensed patents and pulsys technology to gsk for use with its augmentin amoxicillin clavulanate combination products and with limited other amoxicillin products 
under the agreement  gsk was responsible  at its cost and expense  to use commercially reasonable efforts for the clinical development  manufacture and sale of the licensed products 
we received an initial non refundable payment of million from gsk upon signing of the agreement  and a million payment upon achievement of the first milestone 
our receipt of further milestone payments  royalty payments and sales milestone payments under the agreement depended on the ability of gsk to develop and commercialize the products covered by the agreement and was subject to certain conditions and limitations 
the agreement could be terminated at any time by gsk  which it elected to do with an effective date of december  as a result of the termination  we accelerated the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue of approximately million related to the collaboration during the fourth quarter of the termination had no other effects on our financial position 
collaboration with par pharmaceutical for generic clarithromycin in september  we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we licensed to par pharmaceutical the distribution and marketing rights to our generic formulation of abbott s biaxin xl extended release clarithromycin 
during the third quarter of  we conducted bioequivalence studies on two revised formulations of the generic product  with both formulations failing to achieve bioequivalence 
we concluded that due to the non core nature of the product  the expense involved in the development of additional formulations  and the reduced market potential given the emergence of competing products  we would discontinue further development work on the product 
keflex agreements deerfield transaction on november   we entered into a series of agreements with deerfield management  a healthcare investment fund and one of our largest equity shareholders  which provided for a potential capital raise of up to million in cash 
the financing consisted of two potential closings  with the first closing occurring upon the signing of the agreements for million in gross proceeds  less million in transaction expenses and the second closing for an additional million in gross proceeds occurring at our option  contingent upon fda approval of our new drug application for the amoxicillin pulsys adult product 
the agreements were designed to provide us with financial flexibility 
first closing at the transaction s first closing  we sold certain assets  including keflex product inventories  and assigned certain intellectual property rights  relating only to our existing  non pulsys cephalexin business  to two deerfield affiliates  kef pharmaceuticals  inc kef and lex pharmaceuticals  inc lex 
under the terms of the agreement  million was received by middlebrook on november  for the first closing  and middlebrook reimbursed deerfield million for transaction related expenses 
approximately million of those proceeds was used to fully repay the outstanding merrill lynch capital loan balance  with the remainder available for general corporate purposes 
pursuant to a consignment of those assets and license of those intellectual property rights back to the company  the company will continue to operate its existing cephalexin business  subject to consignment and royalty payments to deerfield of of net sales  which decline to should the company elect to make an extension payment of million million if the second closing has occurred as described below by june   subject to a minimum quarterly payment of  in addition  we granted to deerfield a six year warrant to purchase million shares of the company s common stock at  the closing market price on november  second closing the agreements provided for a second closing  at the company s option 
in the event that the we received approval or an acceptable approvable letter of our amoxicillin pulsys new drug application from the fda  then we could require deerfield to acquire and license certain intellectual property rights relating only to our cephalexin pulsys business for a payment of million 
pursuant to a required sublicense of those intellectual property rights back to us  we would continue to operate our cephalexin pulsys activities 
cephalexin pulsys is not approved for marketing by the fda 
to date  we have not exercised this option 
this option expires june  repurchase right deerfield also granted us the right to repurchase all of the assets and rights sold and licensed by us to deerfield by purchasing all of the outstanding capital stock of both kef and lex 
if we exercise this right prior to november   then the purchase price for all of the outstanding capital stock of kef and lex is a total of million  if we have not elected the second closing which would have required deerfield to acquire and license certain intellectual property rights relating to the company s cephalexin pulsys business  or million if we did elect the second closing  in which we would have received million in cash and deerfield would have acquired and licensed certain rights to our cephalexin pulsys business in each case subject to certain adjustments 
those purchase prices will increase by million on each subsequent anniversary of that date until the right is exercised or expires 
our purchase rights expire on june   unless an extension payment of million million  if a second closing has occurred is made to extend the expiration date to december  if an extension payment of million million  if a second closing has occurred is made by december   the expiration date is extended to september  if an extension payment of million million if a second closing has occurred is made by september   then the expiration date for the right to purchase the capital stock of lex is extended to november  we may not exercise our right to purchase the capital stock of lex without first exercising our right to purchase the capital stock of kef 
our exercise of this purchase right is mandatory upon the change of control of the company 
government regulation we are subject to extensive pre and post market regulation by the fda  including regulations that govern the testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising  and promotion of drugs promulgated under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and the public health service act and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
fda approval is required before any new drug can be marketed in the united states 
new drug application process the process required by the fda before a new drug may be marketed in the united states generally involves completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing 
submission of an investigational new drug application ind which must become effective before the commencement of clinical trials 
performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product s intended use 
submission to and approval by the fda of a new drug application nda which includes inspection of manufacturing facilities 
preclinical preclinical studies generally include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry  formulation and stability  as well as animal studies  to assess the safety and efficacy of the product 
preclinical trials also provide a basis for design of human clinical studies 
human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases which may overlap phase i during typical phase i studies  the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion 
phase ii during phase ii studies  the drug is introduced to patients that have the medical condition that the drug is intended to treat 
phase ii studies are intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage 
phase ii studies are sometimes combined with phase i studies referred to as phase i ii studies in certain instances when safety issues and questions of absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion are well established 
phase iii when phase ii evaluations suggest that a dosage range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile  phase iii trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage  clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population  often at geographically dispersed clinical study sites 
the drug sponsor  the fda or the institutional review board at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons  including a concern that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the results of product development  preclinical studies and human studies are submitted to the fda as part of the nda 
the nda also must contain extensive manufacturing information 
the fda may approve or disapprove the nda if applicable fda regulatory criteria are not satisfied or it may require additional data  including clinical data  to continue to evaluate the nda 
as an alternate path to fda approval for new or improved formulations of previously approved products  a company may file a section b nda 
section b of the federal food  drug  cosmetic act permits the filing of an nda where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference 
in other words  the applicant can rely upon fda s previous findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product and or published literature for related products  whether or not approved  and only perform those additional studies or measurements that are needed to support the change from the referenced product 
in our nda submissions  we intend to rely  in part  on prior fda approvals of the antibiotic ingredients used in our products and on data generated by other parties which help to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of those ingredients 
in the case of products that we may develop in conjunction with sponsors of previously approved products  we expect that we will have a specific right of reference to the data contained in the prior applications and submit a traditional nda 
in any case in which we do not have a specific right of reference from the sponsor of the previously approved product  we anticipate that we will submit section b ndas all data necessary to satisfy the fda of the safety and effectiveness of our own versions of these products will have to be generated by or for us and submitted to the fda in support of our applications 
these data are expected to include data establishing the safety and efficacy of the pulsatile dosage form and any other differences between the dosage form and the conditions for use of our products and the dosage form and conditions for use of the previously approved products 
to the extent that the section b applicant is relying on previous fda findings for an already approved product  the applicant is required to certify to the fda concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the fda s orange book 
specifically  the applicant must certify that i the required patent information has not been filed  ii the listed patent has expired  iii the listed patent has not expired  but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration  or iv the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product 
a certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product s listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a paragraph iv certification 
absent a paragraph iv certification  the section b nda will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired 
the section b application also will not be approved until any non patent exclusivity  such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity  listed in the orange book for the referenced product has expired 
these procedures and limitations will not apply to the products in our development pipeline which contain active ingredients that are classified by fda as antibiotics and that were the subject of marketing applications submitted to fda prior to november  the only active ingredients which may be considered in future development projects which do not fall within this exempt antibiotic category are metronidazole  and fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin 
of these  at the present time  we do not believe that the applicable limitations will have any effect on any potential future metronidazole development projects 
with respect to products containing fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin  in the absence of a licensing agreement  any application for approval that we submit to fda may need to include statutorily required certifications regarding our non infringement of certain patents covering previously approved products  we may be required to notify the original nda holder and patent holder of those filings  and we may be subject to approval delays of up to months  or longer  in the event that the patent holder brings suit against us for patent infringement within days of such notifications 
in the case of antibiotic ingredients not previously approved in the combinations that we propose  it will also be necessary for us to satisfy the fda s combination drug policy with data establishing that each active component contributes to the effectiveness of the combination and that the dosage of each component is such that the combination is safe and effective for a significant patient population requiring such concurrent therapy 
this policy typically requires very large clinical trials that test each antibiotic alone and in combination 
in its review of our nda submissions  the fda will have broad discretion to require us to generate data on these matters 
no assurance can be given that ndas submitted for our products will receive fda approval on a timely basis  or at all 
for all of the products that we have in development that contain antibiotic ingredients that were submitted to the fda for approval prior to november   we will not  under current law  be able to submit to the fda patent information covering those products 
therefore  once approved  the fda s orange book  which lists patent information on drug products  will not include patent information on those products 
as a consequence  potential competitors who submit b or anda applications for generic versions of those products will not have to provide certifications regarding any of our patents that they may infringe or to provide us notice if they intend to market their products prior to expiration of those patents 
additionally  if we bring a patent infringement action against any such applicants  there will be no automatic month stay of approval of those potentially infringing products 
however  we would be entitled to pursue traditional patent law procedures and remedies  such as preliminary and permanent injunctions 
in the case of potential generic versions of any of our products that are not classified as exempt antibiotics  such as those containing only metronidazole or fluoroquinolone ingredients such as ciprofloxacin  we would be entitled to list our applicable patents in the orange book  potential competitors who submit b or anda applications for generic version of those products would be subject to the certification and notice requirements  and there could be automatic month stays of approval of the generic products while we pursue patent infringement actions against the applicants 
under the prescription drug user fee act pdufa generally  the submission of an nda is subject to substantial application user fees  currently  and the manufacturer and or sponsor under an approved nda are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees  currently  per product and  per establishment 
these fees are typically increased annually 
in addition  the pdufa statute has been subject to significant amendments in connection with its regular reauthorization 
we are not in a position to predict whether and how the user fee requirements will be interpreted and applied to us and our products in the future 
other regulatory constraints in addition to the results of product development  preclinical animal studies and clinical human studies  an nda also must contain extensive information on the chemistry  manufacturing and controls that relate to the planned routine production and testing of the drug 
an nda must also contain proposed prescribing information for the product  supported by available clinical and other testing data  describing how the product may properly be used 
the fda may approve  deny approval or grant conditional approval depending on whether it finds that information provided sufficiently addresses all issues regarding the manufacture and proposed use of the product candidate 
both prior to and subsequent to approval  the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and fda regulations require that the manufacture and testing of any drug for investigational use or for commercial use in humans be manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practice cgmp 
failure to follow cgmp requirements  as well as other regulatory requirements  can subject a sponsor and its products to various sanctions  including civil and criminal penalties  injunctions against the distribution of products and seizure of violative products 
cgmp requirements are complex  are not always clearly defined  and can evolve over time 
we have used  and intend to continue to use  third party firms that we believe are knowledgeable and qualified in compliance with cgmp requirements to manufacture and test our product candidates and  to the extent that we engage in these activities on our own behalf  intend to utilize cgmp compliant procedures and controls 
there can be no assurance  however  that we or our contractors will be and remain at all times in full compliance with all cgmp requirements 
in addition  the fda retains authority to object to promotional activities engaged in by the applicant  including promotional activities that exceed the scope of approved prescribing information 
under certain circumstances  the fda may also impose post marketing testing requirements and may propose to withdraw or suspend approval of products based on new information about their safety and effectiveness for their approved uses 
foreign regulatory approval outside the united states  our ability to market our products will also be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes all the risks associated with fda approval described above 
the requirements governing conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country 
under european union regulatory systems  marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states 
within days of receiving the application and assessment report  each member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
we plan to choose the european regulatory filing procedure that we believe will allow us to obtain regulatory approvals quickly 
however  the chosen regulatory strategy may not secure regulatory approvals or approvals of the chosen product indications 
in addition  these approvals  if obtained  may take longer than anticipated 
obtaining foreign regulatory approvals would require additional financial resources and in the event we choose to seek those approvals  we would need to raise additional capital 
we cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe or effective  will receive regulatory approvals  or will be successfully commercialized 
employees as of february   we had employees  of whom are senior management  are in supervisory positions and are non management 
of the employees  perform scientific and research activities and hold advanced degrees 
item a 
risk factors there are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those that are indicated by forward looking statements 
those factors include  without limitation  those listed below and elsewhere herein 
risks related to our business we have a history of losses  we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we may never become profitable 
from the date we began operations in january through december   we have incurred losses of approximately million  including a loss of approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  our losses to date have resulted principally from research and development costs related to the development of our product candidates  the purchase of equipment and establishment of our facilities and selling  general and administrative costs related to our operations 
we expect to incur substantial losses in and for the foreseeable future thereafter 
among other things  in we expect to incur significant expenses in anticipation of commercialization of our moxatag product that was approved for marketing by the fda in january we have postponed further development of our keflex pulsys product candidate and our amoxicillin pediatric pulsys product candidate in order to reduce our expenses 
we may also incur losses in connection with the continued sales and marketing of our mg keflex product that was approved for marketing by the fda in may in addition  we expect to incur additional expenses as a result of other research and development costs and regulatory compliance activities 
our chances for achieving profitability depend on numerous factors  including success in obtaining additional financing  commercializing our moxatag extended release amoxicillin tablets product  which was approved for marketing by the fda on january  maintaining sales of our keflex mg product  and successfully developing  gaining fda approval for  and commercializing other product candidates 
we may never become profitable 
if we are unable to complete a strategic transaction  we may  if possible  enter into arrangements to raise additional capital which may dilute the ownership of our equity investors 
we are evaluating various strategic alternatives to further enhance shareholder value  and in february we retained morgan stanley  an investment banking firm  to assist us in this regard 
strategic alternatives we may pursue could include  but are not limited to  continued execution of our operating plan  licensing or development arrangements  the sale of some or all of our company s assets  partnering or other collaboration agreements  or a merger or other strategic transaction 
there can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any agreements or transactions  or that  if completed  any agreements or transactions will be successful or on attractive terms 
revenues we currently generate from our keflex mg product and other keflex product sales are insufficient to cover our expenses 
we expect to incur a loss from operations in however  we believe that our existing cash resources  including the net proceeds from the private placement transaction in january  will be sufficient to fund our operations into the first quarter of at our planned levels of research  development  sales and marketing activities  barring unforeseen developments  and excluding the costs of a commercial launch of moxatag in we are currently evaluating commercialization options for our moxatag product  which was approved for marketing by the fda on january  we believe the moxatag market opportunity would be best addressed through its direct promotion by a national sales force of at least sales representatives 
as such  a commercialization initiative would require significant resources and expertise  and we believe it would be in the company s best interests to seek potential acquirers or partners to capitalize on moxatag s commercial potential 
potential sales and marketing strategies for moxatag include the acquisition of the company by a larger pharmaceutical organization with an established commercialization infrastructure  working with contract sales organizations  developing our own internal sales organization  or co promoting products with collaborative marketing partners 
even if we successfully conclude our strategic evaluation process and identify a third party to assist in the commercialization of moxatag  the earliest we could launch the product would be in the fourth quarter of in addition  in order for the company to participate in the sales and marketing of moxatag  we would need to have sufficient financial resources  which may require us to raise additional capital 
our requirements for additional capital are substantial 
we currently have no committed source of capital  although we are evaluating a number of alternatives 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available to us or  if available  that it will be on favorable terms 
to the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities  the issuance of those securities could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 
in addition  if we obtain debt financing  we may be required to pledge all or a significant portion of our assets to secure such debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness and we may become subject to financial covenants and other terms that restrict the manner in which we can operate our business 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we may need to sell assets  pursue other strategic alternatives and or curtail significantly our development and commercialization activities 
even if we are able to raise capital in the near term  the amount of funds we are able to raise may not be sufficient to allow us to commercially launch moxatag product 
we may need to raise capital on more than one occasion to meet our anticipated expenses for the next twelve months as well as commercially launch moxatag  should we choose to launch the product in the fourth quarter of we further anticipate that we will also need to raise additional capital in the future to allow us to continue to develop keflex pulsys and our other products under development 
if we are unable to maintain sales of our mg keflex product  our liquidity will be further adversely affected 
we launched our keflex mg product in july while we have invested considerable resources in the launch of this product  to date  sales have not met our expectations 
we had previously anticipated that this product would generate revenues in excess of related expenses and would contribute additional cash flow to help fund our other operations by the end of during  we reduced the number of sales representatives and marketing costs associated with keflex in order to more closely match the monthly sales level 
while we believe that the product now generates monthly revenues slightly in excess of related expenses  we cannot assure you that this will continue  as this product may not gain sufficient market acceptance among physicians  the medical community and patients 
the extent to which this product is accepted by physicians is dependent upon a number of factors  including the recognition of the potential advantages  despite higher cost  over alternative generic dosage strengths of cephalexin and the effectiveness of our marketing and distribution capabilities 
in addition  this product faces significant competition from other dosage strengths of cephalexin manufactured by generic pharmaceutical companies  as well as from other dosage strengths of keflex marketed by us 
although there is no current mg dosage strength of generic cephalexin  the product is not protected by patents and we expect to have a limited window of opportunity to market this product  should generic pharmaceutical manufacturers choose to compete with us 
if our mg keflex product does not achieve greater market acceptance  our liquidity will further suffer 
even if sales of this product increase in the short term  we expect that the amount of revenues from this product could decline significantly within a few years due to competition from generic formulations of the product 
our pulsys technology is based on a finding that could ultimately prove to be incorrect  or could have limited applicability 
our pulsys product candidates are based on our finding that bacteria exposed to antibiotics in front loaded  rapid sequential bursts are eliminated more efficiently and effectively than those exposed to presently available treatment regimens 
ultimately  our finding may be incorrect  in which case our pulsatile drugs would not differ substantially from competing drugs and may be inferior to them 
if these products are substantially identical or inferior to products already available  the market for our pulsatile drugs will be reduced or eliminated 
even if pulsatile dosing is more effective than traditional dosing  we may be unable to apply this finding successfully to a substantial number of products in the anti infective market 
our preliminary studies indicate that pulsatile dosing may not provide superior performance for all types of antibiotics 
additionally  we have not conducted any studies with anti viral or anti fungal medications 
if we cannot apply our technology to a wide variety of antibiotics or other anti infectives  our potential market will be substantially reduced 
our pulsys delivery technology may not be effective for product candidates other than moxatag  which would prevent us from commercializing products that are more effective than those of our competitors 
even if we are correct that pulsatile dosing is more effective than traditional dosing of antibiotics  our pulsys delivery technology must be effective in humans such that the pulsatile administration of drugs are at levels that prove effective in curing infections 
if our pulsys delivery technology is not effective in delivering rapid bursts of antibiotics  or is unable to do so at an appropriate concentration and we are not able to create an alternative delivery method for pulsatile dosing that proves to be effective  we will be unable to capitalize on any advantage of our discovery 
should this occur  our pulsatile product candidates may not be more effective than the products of our competitors  which may decrease or eliminate market acceptance of our products 
if a competitor produces and commercializes an antibiotic that is superior to our pulsys antibiotics  the market for our potential products would be reduced or eliminated 
we have devoted a substantial amount of our research efforts and capital to the development of pulsatile antibiotics 
competitors are developing or have developed new drugs that may compete with our pulsatile a number of pharmaceutical companies are also developing new classes of compounds  such as oxazolidinones  that may also compete against our pulsatile antibiotics 
in addition  other companies are developing technologies to enhance the efficacy of antibiotics by adding new chemical entities that inhibit bacterial metabolic function 
if a competitor produces and commercializes an antibiotic or method of delivery of antibiotics that provides superior safety  effectiveness or other significant advantages over our pulsatile antibiotics  the value of our pulsatile drugs would be substantially reduced 
as a result  we would need to conduct substantial new research and development activities to establish new product targets  which would be costly and time consuming 
in the event we are unable to establish new product targets  we will be unable to generate sources of revenue 
we have not conducted an extensive third party patent infringement  invalidity and enforceability investigation on pulsatile dosing and our pulsys technology  and we are aware of at least one issued patent covering pulsatile delivery 
our patents  prior art and infringement investigations were primarily conducted by our senior management and other employees 
although our patent counsel has consulted with management in connection with management s intellectual property investigations  our patent counsel has not undertaken an extensive independent analysis to determine whether our pulsatile technology infringes upon any issued patents or whether our issued patents or patent applications covering pulsatile dosing could be invalidated or rendered unenforceable for any reason 
we are aware of one issued patent owned by a third party that covers certain aspects of delivering drugs by use of two delayed release pulses 
the patent covers a drug delivery system employing two delayed release pulses using two polymers 
the claims made by this patent could be argued to cover certain aspects of our technology 
however  we believe that we will be able to manufacture and market formulations of our pulsatile products without infringing any valid claims under this patent 
any reformulation of our products  if required  could be costly and time consuming and may not be possible 
we cannot assure you that a claim will not be asserted by such patent holder or any other holder of an issued patent that any of our products infringe their patent or that our patents are invalid or unenforceable 
we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
we cannot assure you that  in the event of litigation  any claims would be resolved in our favor 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not valid  may result in substantial costs  could place a significant strain on our financial resources  divert the attention of management and harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could result in substantial damages and force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which license may be costly or may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  or redesign our products  which would be costly and time consuming and may not be possible 
we have not sought patent protection for certain aspects of the technology used in our pulsys product candidates 
we have not filed for patent protection with respect to all of our specific formulations  materials including inactive ingredients or manufacturing process approaches that are incorporated in our pulsys product candidates  and we may not seek such patent coverage in the future 
in producing our pulsys products  we expect to use general formulation techniques used in the industry that would be modified by us and which would  therefore  include know how and trade secrets that we have developed 
we cannot be certain that a patent would issue to cover such intellectual property  and currently  we would prefer to keep such techniques and know how as our trade secrets 
in the event a competitor is able to develop technology substantially similar to ours and patent that approach  we may be blocked from using certain of our formulations or manufacturing process approaches  which could limit our ability to develop and commercialize products 
if we are unable to develop and successfully commercialize our pulsys product candidates  we may never achieve profitability 
we have not commercialized any pulsys products or recognized any revenue from pulsys product sales 
with the exception of moxatag  which was approved for marketing by the fda on january   all of our pulsatile drugs are in early stages of development 
we must obtain regulatory approval for our products before we are able to commercialize these products and generate revenue from their sales 
we expect that we must conduct significant additional research and development activities on our other pulsys product candidates and successfully complete preclinical  phase i  phase i ii or phase ii  and phase iii clinical trials before we will be able to receive final regulatory approval to commercialize these pulsatile products 
even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our pulsys products  we may never generate sufficient or sustainable revenue to enable us to be profitable 
if clinical trials for our products are unsuccessful or delayed  we will be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines 
we must demonstrate through preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans before we can obtain regulatory approvals for their commercial sale 
in addition  we will also need to demonstrate through clinical trials any claims we may wish to make that our product candidates are comparable or superior to existing products 
for drug products which are expected to contain active ingredients in fixed combinations that have not been previously approved by the fda  we may also need to conduct clinical studies in order to establish the contribution of each active component to the effectiveness of the combination in an appropriately identified patient population 
conducting clinical trials is a lengthy  time consuming and expensive process 
with the exception of our moxatag product that has completed phase iii clinical trials  we have not completed preclinical studies and initial clinical trials phase i  phase i ii or phase ii to extrapolate proper dosage for our product candidates for phase iii clinical efficacy trials in humans 
in the event we incorrectly identify a dosage as appropriate for human clinical trials  any results we receive from such trials may not properly reflect the optimal efficacy or safety of our products and may not support approval in the absence of additional clinical trials using a different dosage 
the commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials for our products may be delayed by many factors  including lack of efficacy during the clinical trials  unforeseen safety issues  slower than expected rate of patient recruitment  or government or regulatory delays 
the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials are often not predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
although a new product may show promising results in preclinical and initial clinical trials  it may subsequently prove unfeasible or impossible to generate sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approval 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical studies are susceptible to varying interpretations  which may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
in addition  we may encounter regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors  including results that do not support our claims  perceived defects in the design of clinical trials and changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any delays in  or termination of  our clinical trials or a determination by the fda that the results of our trials are inadequate to justify regulatory approval 
although our moxatag product has been approved for commercial sale  we will not be successful if the product is not accepted by the market 
even though we have obtained regulatory approval to market moxatag  it  or any of our other potential pulsys products  may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and the medical community 
the degree of market acceptance of any pharmaceutical product that we develop will depend on a number of factors  including demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety  cost effectiveness  potential advantages over alternative therapies  reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  and effectiveness of our marketing and distribution capabilities and the effectiveness of such capabilities of our collaborative partners 
our products will compete with a number of products manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies and manufacturers of generic drugs 
our products may also compete with new products currently under development by others 
physicians  patients  third party payors and the medical community may not accept and use any product candidates that we or our collaborative partners develop 
to the extent current antibiotics already successfully treat certain infections  physicians may not be inclined to prescribe our pulsatile drugs for the same indications 
if our products do not achieve significant market acceptance  we will not be able to generate significant revenues or become profitable 
we have limited sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities  and currently depend in large part on a third party contract sales force for the marketing of our keflex mg product 
if we fail to develop our own sales  marketing and distribution capabilities or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties  we will not be able to successfully commercialize our products 
we have limited sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities 
we currently rely in large part on a third party contract sales force provided to us by innovex  the commercialization division of quintiles transnational corporation  for sales and marketing services relating to our keflex mg product 
in order to commercialize our moxatag product which was approved for marketing by the fda on january   or any other product candidates  we will need to considerably expand our commercial capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us 
in order to market any of our product candidates directly  we must considerably expand our commercial infrastructure  including distribution  marketing and sales personnel 
the expansion or contracting of a sales and distribution infrastructure would require substantial resources  which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development efforts 
to the extent that we enter into sales and marketing arrangements with other companies  our revenues will depend on the efforts of others 
these efforts may not be successful 
if we fail to expand sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties  we will experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs 
we rely upon a limited number of pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors  which could impact our ability to sell our keflex products or moxatag 
we rely largely upon specialty pharmaceutical distributors and wholesalers to deliver keflex to end users  including physicians  hospitals  and pharmacies 
product sales to the three major pharmaceutical wholesalers  cardinal health inc  mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation  represented approximately of our net revenue from keflex in there can be no assurance that our distributors and wholesalers will adequately fulfill the market demand for keflex or  after commercial launch  moxatag 
given the high concentration of sales to certain pharmaceutical distributors and wholesalers  we could experience a significant loss if one of our top customers were to declare bankruptcy or otherwise become unable to pay its obligations to us 
the potential success of our products and product candidates  including our keflex mg product and  our recently approved moxatag product  will be dependent upon successfully pricing the products in the marketplace 
while we believe that physicians make antibiotic prescribing decisions based primarily on efficacy  safety  and compliance  we also believe that  when deciding whether to prescribe a modified release drug or its immediate release generic analog  physicians also weigh patient co pay and patient preferences 
as a result  we believe that price will be an important driver of the adoption of our products and product candidates 
in addition  we believe it will be important to carefully manage against resistance from payor organizations by pricing our products in such a way as to minimize the incremental payor cost burden relative to generic analogs 
generic pricing plans  such as that implemented by wal mart and other retailers  may affect the market for our products 
in september  wal mart began offering certain generic drugs at per prescription 
amoxicillin and cephalexin are on the list of drugs that wal mart intends to provide at per prescription 
wal mart has significant market presence 
as a result  there can be no assurance that wal mart s generic pricing plan  and or similar plans adopted by others  will not have a material adverse effect on the market for our products 
our products are subject to therapeutic equivalent substitution  medicaid reimbursement and price reporting 
the cost of pharmaceutical products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies  legislative bodies and private organizations in the us and other countries 
in the us  most states have enacted legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a generic equivalent to the prescribed drug 
federal legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay to state medicaid agencies prescribed rebates on drugs to enable them to be eligible for reimbursement under medicaid programs 
federal and state governments continue to pursue efforts to reduce spending in medicaid programs  including imposing restrictions on amounts agencies will reimburse for certain products 
we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of our products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs 
our ability to earn sufficient returns on our products will depend  in part  on the availability of reimbursements from third party payers  such as health insurers  governmental health administration authorities and other organizations and the amount of rebates payable under medicaid programs 
we are dependent on our contract manufacturers and suppliers to provide us with active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished products 
we do not maintain commercial scale manufacturing facilities 
our keflex products are manufactured for us by ceph international corporation ceph  a wholly owned subsidiary of patheon s mova pharmaceutical corporation 
moxatag is expected to be manufactured for us by stada production ireland limited spi  previously known as the manufacturing division of clonmel healthcare limited  a subsidiary of stada arzneimittel ag  pursuant to a contract manufacturing arrangement we have entered into with them 
although we believe that the active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished keflex and moxatag products could be potentially obtained from several suppliers  our applications for regulatory approval currently authorize only ceph as our source for keflex  and spi is identified as our only source for moxatag 
in the event that ceph and or spi is unable to supply the products to us in sufficient quantities on a timely basis or at a commercially reasonable price  or in the event either of them breaches their agreement with us  or if ceph and or spi loses its regulatory status as an acceptable source  we would need to locate another source 
a change to a supplier not previously approved or an alteration in the procedures or product provided to us by an approved supplier may require formal approval by the fda before the product could be sold and could result in significant disruption to our business 
these factors could limit our ability to sell keflex and or moxatag and could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we obtain active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and finished products from certain specialized manufacturers for use in clinical studies 
although the antibiotics and finished products we use in our clinical studies may generally be obtained from several suppliers  the loss of a supplier could result in delays in conducting or completing our clinical trials and could delay our ability to commercialize products 
our ability to conduct clinical trials will be impaired if we fail to qualify our clinical supply manufacturing facility and we are unable to maintain relationships with current clinical supply manufacturers or enter into relationships with new manufacturers 
we currently rely on several contractors to manufacture product samples for our clinical studies 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed construction of a manufacturing facility in germantown  maryland for production of clinical supplies sufficient for use through our phase ii and  in some cases  phase iii clinical trials 
this facility has the potential to be qualified and operational in the future  although we currently have no plans to qualify the facility 
we intend to rely on third parties to manufacture products that we intend to sell through our own commercialization and sales efforts 
we believe that there are a variety of manufacturers that we may retain to produce these products 
however  once we retain a manufacturing source  if we are unable to maintain our relationship with such manufacturer  qualifying a new manufacturing source will be time consuming and expensive  and may cause delays in the development of our products 
clinical trials for our product candidates may be delayed due to our dependence on third parties for the conduct of such trials 
we have limited experience in conducting and managing clinical trials 
we rely  and will continue to rely  on third parties  including contract research organizations and outside consultants  to assist us in managing and monitoring clinical trials 
our reliance on these third parties may result in delays in completion of  or the failure to complete  these trials if they fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them 
our success may depend on our ability to successfully attract and retain collaborative partners 
for certain product candidates  we may enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties 
collaborations may be necessary in order for us to fund our research and development activities  fund manufacturing by third parties  seek and obtain regulatory approvals  and successfully commercialize our product candidates 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into collaborative agreements with partners on terms favorable to us  or at all  and any future agreement may expose us to risks that our partner might fail to fulfill its obligations and delay commercialization of our products 
we also could become involved in disputes with partners  which could lead to delays in or terminations of our development and commercialization programs and time consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration 
our inability to enter into additional collaborative arrangements with other partners  or our failure to maintain such arrangements  may limit the number of product candidates we can develop and ultimately  decrease our sources of any future revenues 
for a discussion of certain collaboration arrangements to which we were previously a party and which have been terminated  see the information under the caption collaboration agreements in item above 
if we cannot enter into new licensing arrangements or otherwise gain access to products  our ability to develop a diverse product portfolio could be limited 
a component of our business strategy may involve in licensing or acquiring drug compounds developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or academic research laboratories that may be marketed and developed or improved upon using our novel technologies 
competition for promising compounds can be intense and currently we have not entered into any arrangement to license or acquire any drugs from other companies 
if we are not able to identify licensing or acquisition opportunities or enter into arrangements on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop a diverse portfolio of products 
any product candidate that we acquire may require significant additional research and development efforts prior to seeking regulatory approval and commercial sale  including extensive preclinical and or clinical testing 
all product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that the product candidate will not be safe  non toxic and effective or approved by regulatory authorities 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any approved products that we develop or acquire will be manufactured or produced economically  successfully commercialized  widely accepted in the marketplace or that we will be able to recover our significant expenditures in connection with the development or acquisition of such products 
in addition  proposing  negotiating and implementing an economically viable acquisition is a lengthy and complex process 
other companies  including those with substantially greater financial  sales and marketing resources  may compete with us for the acquisition of product candidates and approved products 
we may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates and approved products on terms that we find acceptable  or at all 
in addition  if we acquire product candidates from third parties  we may be dependent on third parties to supply such products to us for sale 
we could be materially adversely affected by the failure or inability of such suppliers to meet performance  reliability and quality standards 
we could be forced to pay substantial damage awards if product liability claims that may be brought against us are successful 
the use of any of our product candidates in clinical trials  and the sale of any approved products  may expose us to liability claims and financial losses resulting from the use or sale of our products 
we have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials  which we believe is adequate to cover our present activities 
however  such insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims made against us 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against losses 
our executive officers and other key personnel are critical to our business and our future success depends on our ability to retain them 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our scientific and management teams  especially edward m 
rudnic  our president and chief executive officer 
in order to pursue our product development  marketing and commercialization plans  we may need to hire additional personnel with experience in clinical testing  government regulation  manufacturing  marketing and business development 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the intense competition for such personnel among biotechnology  pharmaceutical and healthcare companies  universities and non profit research institutions 
we are not aware of any present intention of any of our key personnel to leave our company or to retire 
however  although we have employment agreements with our executive officers  these employees may terminate their services upon days advance notice 
the loss of any of our key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel  may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research  development or business objectives and could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we maintain key man life insurance on dr 
rudnic  such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the costs of the loss of his services and the expense of recruiting and hiring a new president and chief executive officer 
risks related to our industry any inability to protect our intellectual property could harm our competitive position 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies and products in the us and other countries 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate our competitive advantage 
further  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us  and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these foreign countries 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including our patent positions  involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
patents may be challenged  deemed unenforceable  invalidated or circumvented 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that we cover our proprietary technologies with valid and enforceable patents or we effectively maintain such proprietary technologies as trade secrets 
we will apply for patents covering both our technologies and product candidates as we deem appropriate 
we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or products in a timely fashion  or at all  and in any event  the applications we do file may be challenged and may not result in issued patents 
any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies 
in addition  if challenged  our patents may be declared invalid 
even if valid  our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantages 
we rely upon trade secrets protection for our confidential and proprietary information 
we have taken measures to protect our proprietary information  however  these measures may not provide adequate protection 
we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators and consultants 
nevertheless  employees  collaborators or consultants may still disclose our proprietary information  and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
in addition  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
if we do not compete successfully in the development and commercialization of products and keep pace with rapid technological change  we will be unable to capture and sustain a meaningful market position 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change 
while we are not aware of any company using rapid bursts of antibiotics as a treatment method  there are numerous companies actively engaged in the research and development of anti infectives 
our main competitors are large pharmaceutical companies  such as pfizer  glaxosmithkline  wyeth  bristol myers squibb  merck  johnson johnson  roche  schering plough  novartis  sanofi aventis  abbott laboratories  astrazeneca  and bayer  that may develop new drug compounds that render our drugs obsolete or noncompetitive 
smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialty pharmaceutical companies engaged in focused research and development of anti infective drugs  such as trimeris  vertex  adams respiratory therapeutics  gilead sciences  cubist  basilea  replidyne  intermune  oscient  king  advanced life sciences  and others 
drug delivery companies  such as johnson johnson s alza division  biovail  depomed  flamel technologies  and skyepharma  which may develop a dosing regimen that is more effective than pulsatile dosing 
generic drug companies  such as teva  ranbaxy  ivax  sandoz and stada  which produce low cost versions of antibiotics that may contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our pulsys product candidates 
many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products  undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining approvals of products from the fda and other regulatory agencies  and manufacturing and marketing products 
developments by others may render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions  and for licenses of products or technology 
these competitors  either alone or with their collaborative partners  may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective than ours 
if we experience delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  or are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals  we may be unable to commercialize any products 
our product candidates are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation 
the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
if our products are marketed abroad  they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments 
none of our pulsys product candidates has been approved for sale in any foreign market 
the regulatory review and approval process takes many years  requires the expenditure of substantial resources  involves post marketing surveillance and may involve ongoing requirements for post marketing studies 
the actual time required for satisfaction of fda pre market approval requirements may vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product or the medical condition it is intended to treat 
government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon a manufacturer s activities 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may adversely affect the commercialization of any drugs that we or our collaborative partners develop  impose costly procedures on us or our collaborative partners  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our collaborative partners may attain  and adversely affect our receipt of revenues or royalties 
success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials 
data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
any required approvals  once obtained  may be withdrawn 
further  if we fail to comply with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process  we may encounter difficulties including delays in clinical trials or commercialization  product recalls or seizures  suspension of production and or distribution  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  and fines  civil penalties and criminal prosecutions 
we may rely on future collaborative partners to file investigational new drug applications and generally direct the regulatory approval process for some of our products 
these collaborative partners may not be able to conduct clinical testing or obtain necessary approvals from the fda or other regulatory authorities for any product candidates 
if we fail to obtain required governmental approvals  we or our collaborative partners will experience delays in  or be precluded from  marketing products developed through our research 
we and our contract manufacturers also are required to comply with applicable fda good manufacturing practice regulations 
good manufacturing practice regulations include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by the fda 
these facilities must be approved before we can use them in commercial manufacturing of our products 
we or our contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practice requirements and other fda regulatory requirements 
if we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply  we could be subject to fines or other sanctions  or be precluded from marketing our products 
the manufacture and storage of pharmaceutical and chemical products is subject to environmental regulation and risk 
because of the chemical ingredients of pharmaceutical products and the nature of their manufacturing process  the pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation and the risk of incurring liability for damages or the costs of remedying environmental problems 
we use a number of chemicals and drug substances that can be toxic to humans 
these chemicals include acids  solvents and other reagents used in the normal course of our chemical and pharmaceutical analysis  and other materials  such as polymers  inactive ingredients and drug substances  used in the research  development and manufacture of drug products 
if we fail to comply with environmental regulations to use  discharge or dispose of hazardous materials appropriately or otherwise to comply with the conditions attached to our operating licenses  the licenses could be revoked and we could be subject to criminal sanctions and or substantial liability or could be required to suspend or modify our operations 
environmental laws and regulations can require us to undertake or pay for investigation  clean up and monitoring of environmental contamination identified at properties that we currently own or operate or that we formerly owned or operated 
further  they can require us to undertake or pay for such actions at offsite locations where we may have sent hazardous substances for disposal 
these obligations are often imposed without regard to fault 
in the event we are found to have violated environmental laws or regulations  our reputation will be harmed and we may incur substantial monetary liabilities 
we currently have insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to cover our present activities 
however  this insurance may not be available or adequate to cover any losses arising from contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous substances 
market acceptance of our products will be limited if users of our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors 
the commercial success of our products and product candidates will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors  including government health administrators  managed care providers and private health insurers 
we cannot assure you that third party payors will consider our products cost effective or provide reimbursement in whole or in part for their use 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
third party payors may conclude that our products are less safe  effective or cost effective than existing products 
therefore  third party payors may not approve our products for reimbursement 
if third party payors do not approve our products for reimbursement or fail to reimburse them adequately  sales will suffer as some physicians or their patients will opt for a competing product that is approved for reimbursement or is adequately reimbursed 
even if third party payors make reimbursement available  reimbursement levels may not be sufficient for us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
moreover  the trend toward managed healthcare in the united states  the growth of organizations such as health maintenance organizations  and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products  resulting in lower prices and reduced demand for our products 
in addition  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change in ways adverse to us 
while we cannot predict the likelihood of any of these legislative or regulatory proposals  if any government or regulatory agencies adopt these proposals  they could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential regulatory changes and the billing and reimbursement process applicable to underlying conditions may cause price erosion and reduce sales revenue for our products and our products may not be accepted by health care providers 
government and private healthcare programs currently are under financial stress due to overall medical cost increases 
federal and state governments are taking steps to ease the burden on healthcare programs in ways that could affect the pricing of pharmaceuticals 
any such federal and state laws and regulations can have a negative impact on the pricing of prescription drugs  including medicare  medicaid  pharmaceutical importation laws and other laws and regulations that directly or indirectly impose controls on pricing 
market acceptance of our products may depend on the availability of reimbursement by government and private third party payors 
in recent years  there have been numerous proposals to change the healthcare system in the united states 
the growth of managed care organizations mcos eg  medical insurance companies  medical plan administrators  hospital alliances and pharmaceutical benefit managers has placed increase pressure on drug prices and on overall healthcare expenditures 
mcos and government and other private third party payors increasingly are attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both the coverage and the level of reimbursement of drug products 
consequently  the reimbursement status of our products is highly uncertain and we cannot assure that third party coverage will be available or that available third party coverage or payment will be adequate 
other risks healthcare ventures v  lp  healthcare ventures vi  lp  and healthcare ventures vii  lp have significant influence over our business  and the interests of the healthcare ventures partnerships may not be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders 
healthcare ventures v  lp  healthcare ventures vi  lp and healthcare ventures vii  lp currently beneficially own an aggregate of of our outstanding common stock 
james h 
cavanaugh and harold r 
werner  members of our board of directors  are general partners of healthcare partners v  lp  healthcare partners vi  lp  and healthcare partners vii  lp  which are the general partners of healthcare ventures v  lp  healthcare ventures vi  lp and healthcare ventures vii  lp  respectively 
accordingly  the healthcare ventures partnerships are able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election and removal of directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  as well as over the day to day management of our business 
the healthcare ventures partnerships may direct our affairs in a manner that is not consistent with the interests of our other stockholders 
in addition  this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  or impeding a merger or consolidation  takeover or other business combination or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
deerfield management may have significant influence over our ability to raise capital or to enter into certain major transactions  and deerfield s interests may not be consistent with the interests of our other shareholders 
in november  we issued warrants for the purchase of  shares of our common stock to affiliates of deerfield management in connection with the sale of certain non pulsys tangible and intangible assets 
the warrant agreement contains provisions granting rights to deerfield upon the occurrence of certain major transactions  as defined in the agreement 
major transactions include a change in control of the company  a sale of assets of the company exceeding a purchase price of million or representing more than of the company s total assets  the issuance of shares by the company  without the approval of deerfield  in excess of of the company s outstanding common stock  and liquidation or bankruptcy of the company 
in the event of a major transaction  deerfield has the right to require the company to redeem its warrants in cash  at an amount calculated in accordance with the black scholes value as defined in the agreement 
deerfield can also require that this amount be placed into escrow in advance of the closing of a major transaction 
in the event the company attempts to consummate a major transaction without placing the redemption amount in escrow  deerfield has the right to apply for an injunction 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital  incur indebtedness  or consider the sale of company assets in order to fund our operations 
if deerfield does not pre approve the transaction or waive its rights to the redemption of its warrants  and if the company is unable to fund the cash value of the deerfield warrants into escrow in advance of a major transaction  the company may be prevented from closing a financing transaction that it believes is in the interests of a majority of its shareholders 
future sales of our common stock  or the perception that these sales may occur  could depress our stock price 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
this could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities 
selling of a large number of shares by any of our existing shareholders or management shareholders could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
furthermore  if we file a registration statement to offer additional shares of our common stock and have to include shares held by those holders  it could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common stock 
as a result of private placements by us in   and  we currently have four outstanding shelf registration statements permitting investors in these private placements to publicly resell shares of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and provisions of delaware law could discourage a takeover you may consider favorable or could cause current management to become entrenched and difficult to replace 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition of us  or making a merger or acquisition less desirable to a potential acquirer  even when the stockholders may consider the acquisition or merger favorable 
under the terms of our certificate of incorporation  we are authorized to issue million shares of blank check preferred stock  and to determine the price  privileges  and other terms of these shares 
the issuance of any preferred stock with superior rights to our common stock could reduce the value of our common stock 
in particular  specific rights we may grant to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict an ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party  preserving control by present owners and management and preventing you from realizing a premium on your shares 
in addition  we are subject to provisions of the delaware corporation law that  in general  prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of or more of our common stock for five years unless the holder s acquisition of our stock was approved in advance by our board of directors 
these provisions could affect our stock price adversely 
the price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile 
prior to our october initial public offering  there was no public market for our common stock 
the initial public offering price of our common stock was per share 
since our initial public offering  the price of our common stock has been as high as and as low as per share 
some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them 
if a suit were to be filed against us  regardless of the outcome  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we could be forced to pay liquidated damages if we do not maintain the effectiveness of our s registration statements 
in november  we issued warrants for the purchase of  shares of our common stock at a price of to affiliates of deerfield management 
in april  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  at a price of per unit 
in december  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock at a price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
in april  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreements for each of these transactions  we filed with the sec shelf registration statements on form s covering resales of common stock 
the registration rights agreement in each transaction provides that if a registration statement is not effective within a specified number of days of closing  or if we do not subsequently maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement  then in addition to any other rights the investor may have  we will be required to pay the investor liquidated damages in cash 
the sec declared each of our form s s effective within the specified number of days of closing 
however  if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statements in the future  liquidated damages could be substantial

in august  eli lilly and company provided notice of a legal matter relating to keflex to middlebrook 
a product liability claim was filed by jamie kaye moore against eli lilly  teva pharmaceuticals  inc and teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd 
on march  the claim alleges injury from ingestion of some form of keflex 
lilly has filed preliminary objections to the complaint  and has also requested prescription and other records  in order to determine whether the plaintiff ingested brand or generic cephalexin and which manufacturer might be involved 
since the identity of the manufacturer is not known  lilly is not currently requesting indemnification from middlebrook

our business middlebrook pharmaceuticals  inc was incorporated in delaware in december and commenced operations on january  on june   we changed our corporate name from advancis pharmaceutical corporation to middlebrook pharmaceuticals  inc we are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing anti infective drug products that fulfill unmet medical needs in the treatment of infectious disease 
we are developing a portfolio of drugs based on the novel biological finding that bacteria exposed to antibiotics in front loaded  sequential bursts  or pulses  are killed more efficiently than those exposed to standard antibiotic treatment regimens 
we currently have issued us patents and two issued foreign patent covering our proprietary once a day pulsatile delivery technology called pulsys 
we have initially focused on developing pulsys product candidates utilizing approved and marketed drugs that no longer have patent protection or that have patents expiring in the next several years 
our lead pulsatile product candidate  based on the antibiotic amoxicillin  received us food and drug administration fda approval for marketing on january   under the trade name moxatag tm  and our keflex pulsys product candidate  based on the antibiotic cephalexin  is currently under evaluation in phase i clinical trials 
we also have a number of additional pulsatile product candidates in preclinical development  although further development of these candidates will only occur if we secure additional capital resources 
we acquired the us rights to keflex cephalexin from eli lilly in we currently sell our line of keflex products to wholesalers in both capsule and powder formulations  and received fda approval in for two additional keflex strengths mg capsules and mg capsules 
we have focused our commercialization initiatives solely on the keflex mg capsules 
in support of the launch of the keflex mg capsules  we entered into an agreement with a contract sales organization and currently deploy approximately contract sales representatives across the united states 
we have also entered into agreements with third party contract manufacturers for the commercial supply of our products 
in march  we announced that we are evaluating various strategic alternatives to further enhance shareholder value and in february  announced that we retained morgan stanley as our strategic advisor to assist us in this regard 
strategic alternatives we may pursue could include  but are not limited to  continued execution of our operating plan  licensing or development arrangements  the sale of some or all of our company s assets  partnering or other collaboration agreements  or a merger or other strategic transaction 
general our future operating results will depend largely on our ability to successfully commercialize our lead pulsys product  moxatag  and our ability to successfully commercialize our launched keflex mg product  and the progress of other product candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on a number of factors  including risks related to our business  risks related to our industry  and other risks which are detailed in this annual report on form k 
management overview of the key developments in the following is a summary of key events that occurred in amoxicillin pulsys product development moxatag tm approval in august  we announced that our amoxicillin pulsys phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of adolescents and adults with acute pharyngitis and or tonsillitis achieved its desired clinical and microbiological endpoints 
the trial demonstrated statistical non inferiority of amoxicillin pulsys therapy versus the penicillin comparator therapy for the trial s primary endpoints of bacterial eradication rates for two distinct patient populations 
the trial also demonstrated amoxicillin pulsys reached percent bacterial eradication for the per protocol group of patients  in accordance with fda guidance for product approval as first line pharyngitis therapy 
based on the successful phase iii trial data  we submitted a new drug application nda for amoxicillin pulsys on december  on february   we received a refusal to file letter from the fda for our amoxicillin pulsys nda  requesting additional information on our planned commercial manufacturing processes 
the fda did not raise any clinical or other issues in its communication 
we conducted a meeting with the fda regarding our amoxicillin pulsys nda on february   and obtained clarification on the additional information that would be required for the fda to accept our nda for filing 
we resubmitted our amoxicillin pulsys nda on march   and were notified that the nda was accepted for filing on may  in the notification letter  we received a prescription drug user fee act pdufa target action date of january  we received fda approval of our nda on january   for our once daily amoxicillin pulsys product under the trade name moxatag tm amoxicillin extended release tablets for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients years and older with pharyngitis and or tonsillitis secondary to streptococcus pyogenes commonly referred to as strep throat 
with the fda approval of moxatag  physicians now have available the first once daily product in the aminopenicillin class for the treatment of pharyngitis 
marketed products keflex capsules cephalexin usp in  net sales of our branded keflex product line were approximately million  an increase from million in during  we continued our commercialization efforts for our mg strength of keflex capsules through a targeted and dedicated national contract sales force  which currently consists of approximately sales representatives and three middlebrook district sales managers 
our contract sales representatives began directly promoting keflex mg capsules to targeted physicians as well as providing patient starter samples in late july investment bank retained to explore strategic alternatives in march  we announced that we had initiated a process to explore various strategic alternatives to further enhance shareholder value 
subsequent to receiving fda approval for our moxatag product in january  we announced that the strategic review process was ongoing and that we had retained morgan stanley as our strategic advisor to assist us in this regard 
strategic alternatives we may pursue could include  but are not limited to  continued execution of our operating plan  licensing or development arrangements  the sale of some or all of our company s assets  partnering or other collaboration agreements  or a merger or other strategic transaction 
there can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any agreements or transactions  or that  if completed  any agreements or transactions will be successful or on attractive terms 
we do not intend to disclose developments with respect to this process unless and until the evaluation of strategic alternatives has been completed 
cost reduction initiatives for during  we implemented a cost reduction program including personnel reductions  postponement of pulsys clinical development programs other than amoxicillin pulsys for adults and adolescents  and elimination of other discretionary spending during the year 
additionally  future development efforts for our pulsys product candidates other than amoxicillin pulsys will be dependent upon our ability to secure additional capital or to find a partner to help fund their continued development 
private placement transactions in april  we closed a private placement transaction of common stock and warrants  which provided million in net cash proceeds 
subsequent to our december  fiscal yearend  we closed a private placement transaction of common stock and warrants on january   which provided million in net cash proceeds 
agreement for the sale and repurchase rights to our cephalexin assets on november   we announced an agreement with deerfield management  a healthcare investment fund and one of the company s largest equity shareholders  for the sale and license of certain of our cephalexin assets and intellectual property 
under the terms of the agreement  we raised million upon closing of the transaction  and an additional million was available  at our option  upon the approval of our moxatag nda 
proceeds from the transaction were used to retire our outstanding debt of approximately million and were also used for general corporate purposes 
we also retained the right to repurchase all such assets and intellectual property at a future date 
see keflex agreements deerfield transaction  in part i above 
focus for our primary focus for the will be on the manufacturing process for our moxatag product for adults and pediatric patients years and older  along with the continued commercialization of our keflex mg capsules 
our nda supporting moxatag was approved by the fda on january   and we believe moxatag could be marketed to healthcare professionals by as soon as the fourth quarter of  should we successfully conclude our strategic evaluation process 
we intend to continue promoting keflex mg capsules through our approximately contract sales representatives and three middlebrook district sales managers to targeted us physicians throughout  assuming there are no generic competitors that enter the market during the year 
in order to minimize our financing requirements in  we expect to maintain our reduced cost structure implemented during  including personnel reductions  postponement of pulsys clinical development programs  and the elimination of other discretionary spending 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses  fair valuation of stock related to stock based compensation and income taxes 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for the sale of pharmaceutical products and for payments received  if any  under collaboration agreements for licensing  milestones  and reimbursement of development costs as follows product sales 
revenue from product sales  net of estimated provisions  is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably probable 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
provisions for sales discounts  and estimates for chargebacks  rebates  and product returns are established as a reduction of product sales revenue at the time revenues are recognized  based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact these reserves 
factors include current contract prices and terms  estimated wholesaler inventory levels  remaining shelf life of product  and historical information for similar products in the same distribution channel 
these revenue reductions are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance  or as an addition to accrued expenses if the payment is due to a party other than the wholesaler 
chargebacks and rebates 
we record chargebacks and rebates based on the difference between the prices at which we sell our products to wholesalers and the sales price ultimately paid under fixed price contracts by third party payers  including governmental agencies 
we record an estimate at the time of sale to the wholesaler of the amount to be charged back to us or rebated to the end user 
we have recorded reserves for chargebacks and rebates based upon various factors  including current contract prices  historical trends  and our future expectations 
the amount of actual chargebacks and rebates claimed could be either higher or lower than the amounts we accrued 
changes in our estimates would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
product returns 
in the pharmaceutical industry  customers are normally granted the right to return product for a refund if the product has not been used prior to its expiration date  which for our keflex product is typically three years from the date of manufacture two years  in the case of oral suspension products 
our return policy typically allows product returns for products within an eighteen month window from six months prior to the expiration date and up to twelve months after the expiration date 
we estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy  and record a related reserve at the time of sale 
these amounts are deducted from our gross sales to determine our net revenues 
our estimates take into consideration historical returns of our products and our future expectations 
we periodically review the reserves established for returns and adjust them based on actual experience 
the amount of actual product returns could be either higher or lower than the amounts we accrued 
changes in our estimates would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
if we over or under estimate the quantity of product which will ultimately be returned  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
contract revenue 
we use the milestone payment method of revenue recognition when all milestones in respect of payments to be received under contractual arrangements are determined to be substantive  at risk and the culmination of an earnings process 
substantive milestones are payments that are conditioned upon events requiring substantive effort  when the amounts of the milestones are reasonable relative to the time  effort and risk involved in achieving them and when the milestones are reasonable relative to each other and the amount of any up front payment 
if these criteria are not met  the timing of the recognition of revenue from the milestone payment may vary 
up front payments are recorded as deferred revenue 
we estimate the length of the remaining development period and amortize an up front payment over that development period 
reimbursement of development costs 
we record revenue for reimbursement of development costs as the actual costs to perform the work are incurred 
we are required to use judgment in recognizing reimbursement revenue in cases where the agreement provides for funding to us that is not dependent on actual costs we incur within a specific fiscal period 
our policy is to limit revenue recognized to the minimum amounts expected under a specific collaboration agreement and to exclude amounts contingent on future events  such as successful commercialization and future profit sharing  and amounts that are contingently refundable 
revenue recognized is limited to cumulative amounts under each contract such that  at any time  if a termination of the agreement were to occur  revenue previously recognized would not need to be reversed 
cash received in excess of revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue  with the deferred revenue recognized as revenue at the time future events occur that remove the contingencies 
inventories inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out method 
inventory consists of keflex finished capsules and finished oral suspension powder 
we purchase our keflex products from third party manufacturers only at the completion of the manufacturing process  and accordingly have no raw material or work in process inventories 
at least on a quarterly basis  we review our inventory levels and write down inventory that has become obsolete or has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value or is in excess of expected requirements 
inventory levels are evaluated by management relative to product demand  remaining shelf life  future marketing plans and other factors  and reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventories are recorded for amounts which may not be realizable 
intangible assets acquired intangible assets 
we acquired the us rights to the keflex brand of cephalexin in we may acquire additional pharmaceutical products in the future that include license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets 
when intangible assets are acquired  we review and identify the individual intangible assets acquired and record them based on relative fair values 
each identifiable intangible asset is then reviewed to determine if it has a definite life or indefinite life  and definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance compared to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of these factors  we first perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flow  and if the amount is less than the asset s value  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses for services performed and liabilities incurred 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses for services include professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants  contract service fees  such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  fees paid to our contract sales organization  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we also make estimates for other liabilities incurred  including health insurance costs for our employees 
we are self insured for claims made under our health insurance program and record an estimate at the end of a period for claims not yet reported 
our risk exposure is limited  as claims over a maximum amount are covered by an aggregate stop loss insurance policy 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the recognition of compensation expense under the statement on a prospective basis only 
accordingly  prior period financial statements were not restated 
under this transition method  stock based compensation cost for the years ended december  and includes a compensation cost for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the fair value provisions of sfas r 
sfas r also requires us to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to share based compensation rather than recognizing forfeitures as a reduction in expense as they occur 
to the extent actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period that the estimates are revised 
we plan to refine our estimated forfeiture rate as we obtain more historical data 
we determine the value of stock option grants using the black scholes option pricing model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
this model requires that we estimate our future expected stock price volatility as well as the period of time that we expect the share based awards to be outstanding 
we have elected to determine the expected term of share based awards granted subsequent to january  using the transition approach provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 under which an expected term of years may be used for four year grants with ten year contractual terms 
we plan to refine our estimate of expected term in the future as we obtain more historical data 
a shorter expected term would result in lower compensation expense 
to estimate expected future volatility  we considered several factors and data sets  including available information from our limited trading history  as well as the reported volatility rates of other comparable public companies 
we have no implied volatility data since we have no publicly traded options or other financial instruments from which implied volatility can be derived 
for the expected future volatility factor computed for input to the black scholes model  we based our estimate of expected future volatility upon a combination of our historical volatility together with the average of volatility rates of comparable public companies 
using a higher volatility input to the black scholes model would result in a higher compensation expense 
the risk free rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant corresponding with the expected term of the options 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by the employees who receive equity awards 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes by the liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end  based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have not recorded any tax provision or benefit for the years ended december   and we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets since realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards cannot presently be sufficiently assured 
at december  and  we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income  which will begin to expire in under the provisions of section of the internal revenue code  certain substantial changes in our ownership may result in a limitation on the amount of net operating loss and research and experimentation tax credit carry forwards which can be used in future years 
during and  we may have experienced such ownership changes 
ownership changes in and may have created annual limitations of approximately million and million  respectively 
there were no ownership changes under section in other years 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we applied the provisions of fin effective january  the implementation of fin had no impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows  as the company has no unrecognized tax benefits 
warrants freestanding financial instruments  such as detachable warrants  must be evaluated under the authoritative accounting literature to determine whether they should be classified as assets or liabilities derivative accounting  temporary equity  or permanent equity 
management initially evaluates whether the instruments are covered by sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
if the instrument is not governed by sfas  then management determines whether it meets the definition of a derivative under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
to determine whether a specific warrant agreement would follow derivative accounting under sfas  management must first evaluate whether the warrant would meet the definition of equity under the provisions of eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
financial instruments such as warrants that are classified as permanent or temporary equity are excluded from the definition of a derivative for purposes of sfas financial instruments  including warrants  that are classified as assets or liabilities are considered derivatives under sfas  and are marked to market at each reporting date  with the change in fair value recorded in the income statement 
under eitf  contracts that require physical settlement or net share settlement and contracts that give the company the choice of settlement in cash or shares are classified as equity 
contracts that require net cash settlement or that give the counterparty a choice which includes net cash settlement are classified as assets or liabilities  not equity 
if a transaction is outside the control of the company and there is the possibility that the company could net cash settle  then for purposes eitf it is assumed that the company will have to net cash settle  which may preclude accounting for a contract as equity of the company except in certain circumstances where the existing common stockholders would also receive cash 
management judgment is required in evaluating the terms of freestanding instruments  such as warrants  and the application of authoritative accounting literature 
in november  the company issued  warrants to affiliates of deerfield management in connection with the sale and license of certain non pulsys keflex tangible and intangible assets 
the warrant agreement contains provisions for cash settlement under certain conditions  including a major asset sale or acquisition in certain circumstances  which is available to the warrant holders at their option 
as a result  management concluded that the warrants should be classified as a liability at their contractual fair value in the consolidated balance sheet 
registration payment arrangements the company views a registration rights agreement containing a liquidated damages provision as a separate freestanding contract which has nominal value  and the company has followed that accounting approach  consistent with fasb staff position no 
eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements 
under this approach  the registration rights agreement is accounted for separately from the financial instrument 
under fsp no 
eitf  registration payment arrangements are measured in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
should the company conclude that it is more likely than not that a liability for liquidated damages will occur  the company would record the estimated cash value of the liquidated damages liability at that time 
consolidation of variable interest entities fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority of voting interest  however  there may situations where the controlling financial interest may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests 
variable interest entities are entities that are subject to consolidation because they meet the provisions of fin r 
management judgment is required in identifying potential variable interest entities and in evaluating the application of the provisions of fin r to those potential variable interest entities 
paragraph of fin r specifies that an entity shall be subject to consolidation under fin r if a the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or b the equity investment holders lack the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity s activities  the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity 
if management concludes that an entity is a variable interest entity under fin r  an analysis must then be made to determine if there is a primary beneficiary  using either a qualitative or quantitative approach 
in accordance with fin r  middlebrook management evaluated whether the deerfield affiliates kef and lex are variable interest entities and  if so  whether there is a primary beneficiary with a controlling financial interest 
since middlebrook is making the important decisions with respect to the ongoing activities involving the assets owned by kef and lex  the kef and lex entities were determined to be variable interest entities for this characteristic 
since middlebrook has a fixed price repurchase option  the equity holders in kef and lex do not have rights to all of the residual returns of the entities  so kef and lex were determined to be variable interest entities for this characteristic 
management used a qualitative analysis to determine whether deerfield or middlebrook was the primary beneficiary of the entities 
middlebrook was determined to be the primary beneficiary  since it is the party exposed to the majority of the risks 
thus  middlebrook consolidates the financial condition and results of operations of kef and lex in accordance with fin r 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  eitf 
eitf concludes that nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
this consensus is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements  eitf 
eitf requires collaborators to present the result of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
in addition  a participant in a collaborative arrangement should provide the following disclosures separately for each collaborative arrangement a the nature and purpose of the arrangement  b its rights and obligations under the collaborative arrangement  c the accounting policy for the arrangement in accordance with apb opinion  disclosure of accounting policies  and d the income statement classification and amounts arising from the collaborative arrangement between participants for each period an income statement is presented 
eitf will be effective for annual periods beginning after december  adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after december  sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  and the goodwill acquired in the business combination 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r will be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas r will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 sfas 
sfas changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests nci and classified as a component of equity 
the statement also requires that entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
sfas will be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued a fasb staff position  or fsp  to defer the effective date of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas  for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the fsp defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november  the delay is intended to provide the board additional time to consider the effect of certain implementation issues that have arisen from the application of sfas to these assets and liabilities 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
research and development expenses we expect our research and development expenses to be significant as we continue to develop our product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products  and costs of facilities 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments  assuming sufficient financial resources are available  in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies 
summary of product development initiatives 
the following table summarizes our product development initiatives for the fiscal years ended december   and included in this table is the research and development expense recognized in connection with each product candidate currently in clinical development and all preclinical product candidates as a group

we record direct costs  including personnel costs and related benefits and stock based compensation  on a project by project basis 
we record indirect costs that support a number of our research and development activities in the aggregate 
on january   we received approval for marketing from the fda of our amoxicillin pulsys adult product  with the trade name moxatag 
see our lead product moxatag amoxicillin extended release tablets above for clinical development background 
we previously had an agreement under which par pharmaceutical was to be responsible for funding the anticipated future development costs of this product 
see termination of our collaboration with par pharmaceutical for amoxicillin pulsys above 
our amoxicillin pediatric sprinkle product is ready for phase ii clinical trials 
see amoxicillin pediatric pharyngitis program above 
direct project costs for keflex product development include development costs for the non pulsatile keflex mg and keflex mg line extension products  which commercially launched in july  as well as research and development costs for a once a day keflex pulsys product  currently in phase i clinical trials 
additional development of keflex pulsys is on hold  until we have sufficient financial resources 
we have discontinued development efforts for this product 
see our collaboration with par pharmaceutical for generic clarithromycin above 
net losses we have a limited history of operations 
we anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including progress of our research and development efforts  approval and commercial launch of new products  and the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals 
our limited operating history makes predictions of future operations difficult or impossible 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate incurring additional annual losses  perhaps at higher levels  for the foreseeable future 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenues 
we recorded revenues of million during the fiscal year ended december  compared to million during the fiscal year ended december   composed of keflex product sales as follows product sale revenues keflex mg capsules keflex mg and mg capsules total prior to the third quarter of  net product sales consist primarily of shipments of the keflex and milligram strengths to wholesalers 
in july  we launched a milligram strength capsule  supported by a targeted and dedicated national contract sales force of sales representatives and eight advancis district sales managers 
sales of mg in reflected a full months of shipments as compared to six months in sales of keflex mg and mg capsules increased in primarily due to price increases implemented during the year

consignment and royalty payments due to affiliates of deerfield management from middlebrook based on sales of all keflex non pulsys products  beginning in november  which approximated  for the period from november  through december   are eliminated in the consolidated statement of operations in accordance with fin r 
obsolescence provisions result from projections of future sales compared to inventory levels  and a determination that a portion of inventory may not be sold prior to expiration date 
research and development expenses

year ended december  interest income interest expense total  net warrant expense 
warrant expense in of million resulted from an initial charge of million  reduced by a credit at year end of million as the options were revalued based upon the year end stock price  which had declined since the warrants were issued on november  other income 
other income of million in represents forgiveness of our debt to montgomery county 
during we received notice from montgomery county that we had met the conditions required for our development loan to be forgiven  and accordingly the full amount was recognized as other income in the quarter 
other income of million in represents the recognition in income of an advance payment received in from a potential buyer of our keflex brand 
we did not enter into a definitive agreement for the asset sale  and in january we decided to retain the keflex assets 
the agreement in principle expired on february  under the circumstances  the advance payment of  was not refundable and was therefore recognized as income in noncontrolling interest 
pursuant to the agreements that we entered into with deerfield management in november  we consolidate the financial condition and results of operations of kef pharmaceuticals  inc and lex pharmaceuticals  inc 
in accordance with fin r 
accordingly  we have deducted the losses of  attributable to the noncontrolling interest the losses of kef and lex from our net loss in the consolidated statement of operations  and we have also reduced the noncontrolling interest holders ownership interest in kef and lex in the consolidated balance sheet by the losses of kef and lex 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenues

net revenue for other keflex products was million  consisting entirely of net product sales of keflex and capsules  as compared to million in the decrease in keflex sales compared to prior periods was mainly due to a net reduction in orders received from our wholesaler customers for our keflex and products 
in addition  there is increasing substitution of generic cephalexin for prescriptions of existing mg and mg keflex brand capsules 
net product sales of our oral suspension keflex product were insignificant for the periods presented 
revenues recognized in for amortization of upfront licensing fees represent the amortization of a million upfront payment received from par pharmaceutical in may in connection with our collaboration for amoxicillin pulsys  which was being amortized into revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated development period 
on august   par terminated the amoxicillin pulsys collaboration  at which time we recognized the remaining deferred revenue balance of million 
reimbursement of development costs by par was recognized based on the related costs incurred 
as a result of the contract termination by par on august   we accelerated the revenue recognition of million in the third quarter  which was the remaining deferred revenue balance in excess of the amount retained for future contingent liability to par

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period after contractual obligations  total in thousands minimum purchase commitments minimum royalty commitment operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments this table does not include potential royalty payments  at a rate of of sales value  to eli lilly and company  which may be due on product line extensions of keflex  including keflex mg 
any such royalties cannot be estimated at this time 
this table does not include a contingent liability to par pharmaceutical under our amoxicillin development and commercialization agreement that was terminated by par in august under certain circumstances  the termination clauses of the agreement may entitle par to receive a share of future net profits  if any  up to one half of par s total million investment in the development of certain amoxicillin pulsys products  should a product covered by the agreement be successfully commercialized 
accordingly  we retained million of deferred revenue in recognition of this contingent liability to par 
in the event we were to terminate our innovex sales contract  we would incur minimum costs to exit of approximately million 
the remaining purchase commitments include costs of our product manufacturing capability under development in ireland and puerto rico 
effective november   we pay consignment payments and royalties to deerfield at of net keflex revenues  with a minimum combined quarterly payment of  the combined rate declines to if we elect to make an extension payment  as defined in the agreements with deerfield  of million million if a second closing has occurred to deerfield by june  the related agreements expire june   unless extension payments are made  at the company s option  to extend the expiration dates of the repurchase rights 
in addition to the minimum purchase commitments required under our contracts  we expect to incur additional amounts under the contractual arrangement 
these amounts represent the remaining contractual amount due over the remaining innovex contract term  for on on going commercialization efforts related to moxatag  and for manufacturing and research related to our keflex products  in addition to the minimum purchase commitments and contractual obligations in the above table  we may incur funding liabilities for additional obligations which we enter into on a discretionary basis 
these discretionary obligations could include additional facilities or equipment  investments in new technologies or products  acquisitions  funding of clinical trials  or similar events 
due to the approval of moxatag in january  we authorized the re start of pre production development work at the clonmel facility  to prepare for commercial production of moxatag 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements that meet the definition of off balance sheet arrangements  with the exception of our private placements of common stock and warrants in april and april warrants are instruments that meet the definition of a derivative under sfas  although they may qualify for the scope exception under paragraph of sfas in the april private placement  warrants were issued to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in the april private placement  warrants were issued to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in november  warrants were issued to affiliates of deerfield management to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of  these warrants have been determined to be a derivative and have therefore been recorded as a liability in our december  balance sheet 
in august  the company leased additional space adjacent to its germantown  maryland  facility 
we ceased the use of this facility during the third quarter of effective april  another company leased approximately percent of the facility directly from the landlord  with the landlord amending our lease to reflect a rent reduction for the amount of rent the landlord will receive each month from the other company 
we remain contingently liable for the other company s rental payments under a financial guarantee to the landlord 
due to the financial guarantee  we have included percent of the full building rent in our contractual obligations table above for operating lease obligations 
prospective information risks and uncertainties related to our future capital requirements at december   unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million  and in january  we closed a private placement of common stock and warrants for net cash proceeds of million 
we are evaluating various strategic alternatives to further enhance shareholder value  and in february we retained morgan stanley  an investment banking firm  to assist us in this regard 
strategic alternatives we may pursue could include  but are not limited to  continued execution of our operating plan  licensing or development arrangements  the sale of some or all of our company s assets  partnering or other collaboration agreements  or a merger or other strategic transaction 
there can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any agreements or transactions  or that  if completed  any agreements or transactions will be successful or on attractive terms 
we expect to incur a loss from operations in however  we believe that our existing cash resources  including the net proceeds from the private placement transaction in january  will be sufficient to fund our operations at least into the first quarter of at our planned levels of research  development  sales and marketing activities  barring unforeseen developments 
furthermore  due to the approval of our amoxicillin pulsys nda on january   we have the right  if we choose to give notice by june   to require a second closing of the deerfield transaction  in which we would receive an additional payment of million  net  in exchange for the acquisition and license by deerfield of certain intellectual property rights relating only to the company s cephalexin pulsys business  we would retain the right to operate that business subject to certain future consignment and royalty payments to deerfield  should a cephalexin pulsys product be successfully developed and commercialized as well as the right to reacquire those intellectual property rights at some point in the future 
to minimize our cash requirements  we have continued our program of cost reductions including personnel reductions  postponement of pulsys clinical development programs  and elimination of other discretionary spending 
our net cash requirements for will depend  among other things  on the cash received from sales of our existing non pulsys products primarily sales of keflex capsules in mg  mg and mg strengths and the cash expended for cost of products sold  including royalties due to eli lilly on keflex net revenues and consignment and royalty payments due to deerfield on all keflex net revenues  research and development spending  sales and marketing expenses for keflex and moxatag  and general and administrative expenses 
our cash receipts and cash expenditures assumptions for include the following continuation of keflex monthly prescriptions at the current  to  prescriptions per month rate end user demand  assuming no generic competitive product enters the market in  validation and manufacturing scale up activities at our contract manufacturing site in clonmel  ireland  in preparation for the moxatag product launch  research and development programs for pulsys product candidates basically on hold unless and until additional finance is obtained  a sales force of approximately representatives  excluding the sales and marketing cost of a commercial launch of moxatag  and continued focus on reductions in discretionary spending 
we expect to incur a significant loss in  as we expect that revenues from product sales will not be sufficient to fully fund our operating costs 
these estimates are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary 
our cash projections for do not include the cost of selling and marketing activities for the commercial launch of moxatag 
we are currently evaluating commercialization options for our moxatag product 
we believe the moxatag market opportunity would be best addressed through its direct promotion by a national sales force of at least sales representatives 
as such  a commercialization initiative would require significant resources and expertise  and we believe it would be in the company s best interests to seek potential acquirers or partners to capitalize on moxatag s commercial potential 
potential sales and marketing strategies for moxatag include the acquisition of the company by a larger pharmaceutical organization with an established commercialization infrastructure  working with contract sales organizations  developing our own internal sales organization  or co promoting products with collaborative marketing partners 
even if we successfully conclude our strategic evaluation process and identify a third party to assist in the commercialization of moxatag  the earliest we could launch the product would be in the fourth quarter of in addition  in order for the company to participate in the sales and marketing of moxatag  we would need to have sufficient financial resources  which may require us to raise additional capital 
we have experienced significant losses since our inception in  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the process of developing and commercializing our products requires significant research and development work  preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as regulatory approvals  significant marketing and sales efforts  and manufacturing capabilities 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to continue to result in significant operating losses for the foreseeable future 
to date  the revenues we have recognized from our non pulsys products have been limited and have not been sufficient for us to achieve or sustain profitability 
our product revenues are unpredictable in the near term and may fluctuate due to many factors  many of which we cannot control  including the market acceptance of our products 
if our products fail to achieve market acceptance  we would have lower product revenues which may increase our capital requirements 
our estimates of future capital requirements are uncertain and will depend on a number of factors  including the progress of our research and development of product candidates  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  cash received from sales of our existing non pulsys products  payments received or made under any future collaborative agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the acquisition of licenses for new products or compounds  the status of competitive products  the availability of financing and our or our partners success in developing markets for our product candidates 
changes in our commercialization plans  partnering activities  regulatory activities and other developments may increase our rate of spending and decrease the period of time our available resources will fund our operations 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research  development or commercialization programs  or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
we have no unused credit facility  or other committed sources of capital  except for the million we would be entitled to receive in the event that we request a second closing from deerfield and require deerfield to license certain intellectual property rights relating to cephalexin pulsys  as described above 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital  incur indebtedness  or consider the sale of company assets in order to fund our operations 
there is no assurance additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our ability to raise capital by issuing additional equity may require the prior approval of deerfield management  under the terms of its warrant agreement  to the extent the number of common shares to be issued exceeds of the outstanding common shares  should deerfield not approve the transaction  it may require the redemption of its warrants in cash  at the contractual fair value calculated in accordance with the black scholes formula 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our commercialization efforts  effect changes to our facilities or personnel  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
any future funding may dilute the ownership of our equity investors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and restricted cash that generally have maturities of less than one year 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any significant impact on the realized value of our investments 
fair value of warrants derivative liabilities as of december   the estimated fair value of warrant liabilities recorded on our balance sheet  which are related to the deerfield transaction  was million 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments using the black scholes option pricing model which takes into account a variety of factors  including stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  remaining term  and the closing price of our common stock 
the determination of the fair value of the deerfield warrants is most significantly affected by the change in the closing price of our common stock 
the stock price volatility factor for the deerfield warrants is not a risk exposure  as the volatility factor is fixed in the agreement 
the following table illustrates the potential effect of changes in the assumptions used to calculate fair value increase decrease in fair value of derivative increase in stock price increase in stock price increase in risk free interest rate decrease in stock price decrease in stock price decrease in risk free interest rate the company s stock price at the market close on december  was per share 
on january   the company publicly announced the approval for marketing by the fda of its moxatag product  and the company s stock price closed at per share 
as of march   the company s stock price was per share 
the significant increase in the company s stock price would be the primary reason for a significant increase in the fair value of the warrant liabilities  from million as of december  to approximately million as of march  we cannot predict our future stock prices nor can we predict the future fair value of the warrant liabilities 
inflation our most liquid assets are cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our intellectual property 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets are not affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources
