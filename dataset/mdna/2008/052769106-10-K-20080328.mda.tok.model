in addition  forward looking statements also consist of statements involving expectations regarding product acceptance  continuation of our stock repurchase program  and short term and long term cash requirements  as well as  statements involving trend analyses and statements including such words as may  believe  could  anticipate  would  might  plan  expect  and similar expressions or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report on form k and are subject to business and economic risks 
as such  our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth above in item a  risk factors  and in our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made 
strategy our goal is to be the world s leading d and d design software and services company for the architecture  engineering  construction  manufacturing  geospatial mapping and digital media markets 
our focus is to offer our customers the ability to visualize  simulate and analyze real world performance early in the design process to foster innovation  enhance quality  and save time and money 
worldwide business trends such as globalization  sustainability  investment in infrastructure  and the price of oil are creating pressure on our customers to increase innovation while improving productivity 
our customers are seeking differentiation through design  and we believe our products provide a competitive advantage to succeed in this environment 
we believe that our ability to make technology available to mainstream markets is one of our competitive advantages 
by innovating in existing technology categories  we bring powerful design products to volume markets 
our products are designed to be easy to learn and use  and to provide customers low cost of deployment  low total cost of ownership and a rapid return on investment 
in addition  our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration 
we have created a large global community of resellers  third party developers and customers  which provides us with a broad reach into volume markets 
our reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with global resources for the purchase and support of our products as well as resources for effective and cost efficient training services 
we have a significant number of registered third party developers  creating products that operate with our software products  further extending our reach into volume markets 
users trained on our products are broadly available both from universities and the existing work force  reducing the cost of training for our customers 
to train the next generation of users  we offer education programs  including classroom support  standardized curricula  instructor development  and specially priced software purchasing options 
our growth strategy derives from these core strengths 
we continue to increase the business value of our desktop design tools in a number of ways 
we improve the performance and functionality of existing products with each new release 
our most recent product release commenced in march beyond our d horizontal design products  we develop products addressing industry specific needs including d vertical and d model based products 
we continually strive to improve our product functionality and specialization by industry while increasing product interoperability and usability 
by doing this  we drive technology democratization and increase customer loyalty 

table of contents in addition  we believe that migration of our customers from our d horizontal products to our d vertical products and d model based design products  presents a significant growth opportunity 
for fiscal  revenue from d model based design products increased as compared to the prior fiscal year  and autodesk shipped more than  commercial seats which includes new seats and crossgrade seats of d model based design products  including  seats of revit   seats of autodesk inventor and  seats of autocad civil d 
while the rate of migration to d vertical products and d model based design products varies from industry to industry  adoption of d vertical products and d model based design software should increase the productivity of our customers in all industries and result in richer design data 
however  this migration also poses various risks to us 
in particular  if we do not successfully convert our d horizontal customer base to our d vertical products and d model based design products as expected  sales of our d horizontal products may decrease without a corresponding increase in customer seats of our d vertical products and d model based design products  we would not realize the growth we expect and our business would be adversely affected 
expanding our geographic coverage is a key element of our growth strategy 
we believe that rapidly growing emerging economies present significant growth opportunities for us 
in fiscal  revenue from emerging economies increased as compared to fiscal revenue from emerging economies represented of fiscal net revenue as compared of fiscal net revenue 
conducting business in these emerging economies presents significant challenges  including intellectual property protection and software piracy  which remain substantial problems 
another significant part of our growth strategy is to continue to move customers to our subscription program 
we strive to sell subscription contracts to all new customers  migrate existing upgrade customers to subscription contracts and renew subscription contracts with existing subscription customers 
this business model results in a more efficient sales process than our traditional upgrade process and reduces volatility in our revenue 
moving customers to our subscription program ensures that we have more customers on current versions of our products  increases customer loyalty and increases the likelihood that they will migrate to our d model based design products 
all revenue from our subscription program is maintenance revenue on our consolidated statements of income 
maintenance revenue grew in fiscal  as compared to growth of in the prior fiscal year 
our subscription base has grown substantially over the past several years and now consists of nearly million users 
as a result  while we expect growth in maintenance revenue from our subscription program in the future to continue to be strong  we expect the growth rate to be lower than in the past 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regularly reevaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 

table of contents we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for multiple element arrangements that include software products  we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority 
if we do not have vsoe of the undelivered element  we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements are delivered 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition 
if we do not believe that collection is probable  the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 
our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor or reseller provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria 
we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments  regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers 
our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
product returns reserves 
we permit our distributors and resellers to return products up to a percentage of prior quarter purchases 
the product returns reserve is based on historical experience of actual product returns  estimated channel inventory levels  the timing of new product introductions and promotions  channel sell in for applicable markets and other factors 
our product returns reserves were million at january  and million at january  product returns as a percentage of applicable revenue were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal during fiscal year and  we recorded additions to our product returns reserves of million and million  respectively  which reduced our revenue 
while we believe our accounting practice for establishing and monitoring product returns reserves is adequate and appropriate  any adverse activity or unusual circumstances could result in an increase in reserve levels in the period in which such determinations are made 
partner incentive reserves 
autodesk has a partner incentive program that uses quarterly attainment monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a specified time period 
a portion of these reserves reduce license and other revenue in the current period 
the remainder  which relates to incentives on our subscription program  reduces deferred revenue in the period the subscription transaction is billed  which results in a reduction to maintenance revenue over the maintenance contract period 
partner incentive reserves were million and million at january  and  respectively 
realizability of long lived assets 
we assess the realizability of our long lived assets and related intangible assets  other than goodwill  annually during the fourth fiscal quarter  or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable 
we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant under performance of a business or product line relative to budget  shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and the results of past impairment reviews 

table of contents in assessing the recoverability of these long lived assets  we first determine their fair values  which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets 
when assessing long lived assets  we use undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows 
because expected lives are relatively short  discounting the projected cash flows would not lead to a significantly different result 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of the impairment charge 
impairment charges  if any  result in situations where the fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 
in addition to our recoverability assessments  we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets 
any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made  as well as in subsequent quarters 
we will continue to evaluate the values of our long lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 
goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
when assessing goodwill for impairment  we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill assets are impaired or the amount of the impairment charge 
impairment charges  if any  result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 
income taxes 
we currently have million of net deferred tax assets  mostly arising from net operating losses including stock option deductions taken in fiscal years prior to fiscal  tax credits  non deductible accruals and timing differences for purchased technologies and capitalized software  offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries 
we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets  which is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income of approximately million across a specific mix of geographies 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made 
autodesk is a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate is based on expected geographic mix of earnings  statutory rates  intercompany transfer pricing  and enacted tax rules 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis 
we believe our tax positions  including intercompany transfer pricing policies  are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
it is possible that these positions may be challenged which may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
on february  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons such as current year tax positions  expiration of statutes of limitations  litigation  legislative activity  or other changes in facts regarding realizability 
share based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas and supersedes apb sfas r requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of february   the first day of our fiscal year our consolidated financial statements for fiscal and reflect our adoption of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated for  and do not include the impact of  compensation expense calculated under sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of income 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb  as permitted by sfas under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense resulted primarily from stock option grants to non executive employees at exercise prices below fair market value on the option measurement date 
the majority of these grants were made between august and february we use the black scholes merton option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for employee stock awards 
this is the same option pricing model used in prior years to calculate the pro forma compensation expense under our sfas footnote disclosures 
this model requires the input of assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected life  expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate of each award 
the parameters used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted  as needed 
compensation expense for employee stock awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
the adoption of sfas r also requires certain changes to the accounting for income taxes  the method used in determining diluted shares  the application of a pre vesting forfeiture rate against both pre and post adoption grants  as well as additional disclosure related to the cash flow effects resulting from share based compensation 
legal contingencies 
as described in part i  item  legal proceedings and part ii  item  note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings 
we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability for the estimated loss 
because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters  we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates 
such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this statement will be effective for autodesk s fiscal year beginning february  autodesk is currently evaluating the impact that sfas r will have on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb also issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest  and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and 
table of contents distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
this statement will be effective for autodesk s fiscal year beginning february  autodesk does not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which expands the use of fair value measurement by permitting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
this statement is required to be adopted by autodesk as of february  autodesk does not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but instead is intended to eliminate inconsistencies with respect to this topic found in various other accounting pronouncements 
this statement is effective as of february  for autodesk s fiscal year  including interim periods within our fiscal year  with the exception of a one year deferral for the implementation of the statement for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
autodesk does not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
overview of fiscal results of operations fiscal year ended january  as a of net revenue fiscal year ended january  as a of net revenue in millions net revenue cost of revenue operating expenses income from operations the primary goals for fiscal were to continue our delivery of market leading products and solutions to our customers and to drive revenue growth and increases in operating margins and operating cash flow 
during fiscal  we released our family of products  offering our customers continued advancements in design and authoring productivity as well as digital prototyping and product lifecycle management capabilities 
during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  net revenue increased  income from operations increased and operating cash flow increased 
net revenue for fiscal increased due to an increase in license and other revenue of and an increase in maintenance revenue from our subscription program of 
net revenue for our d products and d model based design products increased  and  respectively  during fiscal  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
a critical component of our growth strategy is to continue to add new d horizontal users  while migrating our customers to our higher value d vertical and d model based design products 
our total operating margin increased from of net revenue in fiscal to in fiscal this improvement is primarily due to an increase in our media and entertainment segment s operating income by million in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in operating income from our media and entertainment segment was due to higher gross margins from advanced systems resulting from a shift to sales of our linux based systems  a shift to system sales comprised of more software and less hardware and a increase in net revenue from our animation products 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in 
table of contents amortization of acquisition related intangibles of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal we continue to invest in growth and productivity initiatives and  over the longer term we intend to continue to balance investments in revenue growth opportunities with our goal of increasing our operating margins 
our operating margins are very sensitive to changes in revenue  given the relatively fixed nature of most of our expenses  which consist primarily of employee related expenditures  facilities costs  and depreciation and amortization expense 
for fiscal  we expect total costs and expenses to increase in absolute dollars  but decline slightly as a percentage of net revenue resulting in overall operating margin improvement as compared to fiscal we will continue to balance investments in revenue growth opportunities with our focus on increasing profitability 
we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the united states  japan  germany  united kingdom  italy  france  canada  china  south korea and australia 
the weaker value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies had a positive effect of million on operating income in fiscal compared to fiscal had exchange rates from fiscal been in effect during fiscal  translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been million lower and operating expenses would have been million lower 
foreign currencies had a minimal effect on financial results for fiscal changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue in future periods 
we use foreign currency option collar contracts to reduce a portion of the current quarter exchange rate effect on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions 
throughout fiscal  we maintained a strong balance sheet  generating million of cash from operating activities as compared to million during the previous fiscal year 
we finished fiscal with million in cash and marketable securities  of which million is classified as long term 
this is an increase from the million balance at january  we managed to achieve this increase while repurchasing million shares of our common stock and continuing to invest in our business through acquisitions  including robobat  navisworks and hanna strategies and investments in other growth initiatives 
comparatively  during the prior fiscal year we repurchased million shares of our common stock  completed the acquisition of constructware and invested in a interest in hanna strategies 
we completed fiscal with a higher deferred revenue balance and higher accounts receivable balance as compared to the previous fiscal year 
our deferred revenue balance at january  included million of customer maintenance contracts related to our subscription program  which will be recognized as maintenance revenue ratably over the life of the contracts  which is predominantly one year 

table of contents results of operations net revenue fiscal year ended january  increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions net revenue license and other maintenance net revenue by geographic area americas europe  middle east and africa asia pacific net revenue by operating segment design solutions media and entertainment other net revenue design solutions segment platform solutions and emerging business division and other architecture  engineering and construction division manufacturing solutions division fiscal net revenue compared to fiscal net revenue license and other revenue license and other revenue are comprised of two components all forms of product license revenue and other revenue 
product license revenue includes revenue from the sale of new seats  revenue from the autodesk upgrade program and revenue from the autodesk crossgrade program 
other revenue consists of revenue from consulting and training services  revenue from the autodesk developers network  autodesk collaborative solution hosting revenue  autodesk s location services division and revenue from advanced systems product support 
growth in license and other revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to growth in new seat revenue for most major products driven by the release of our family of products 
total license and other revenue increased for fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of total net revenue  license and other revenue was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions  including tech data corporation and its affiliates  who accounted for  and of autodesk s consolidated net revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 

table of contents during fiscal  we made changes to our partner incentive programs to incent our value added resellers to shift their focus to selling d vertical products and d model based design products 
these new programs  which are accounted for as a reduction to net revenue  drive a consistent treatment of incentives around the world by further reallocating incentives from our d horizontal products  autocad and autocad lt  to d vertical and d model based design products 
we believe that changes to our partner incentive programs are having the intended effect of shifting our resellers focus to selling d vertical and d model based design products 
revenue from the sale of new seats increased from fiscal to fiscal the increase is due to an increase in revenue from new seats of our d products  primarily autocad lt  autocad  autocad mechanical and autocad architecture 
the increase was also due to a increase in revenue from new seats of our d model based design products revit products  autodesk inventor products  autocad civil d  and navisworks software 
the increase in new seat revenue was driven primarily by higher average sales prices per seat and volume growth in both our d design and d model based design products 
the positive effect of the weaker value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies also contributed to the increase in total net revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  we experienced growth in net revenue in all three of our geographic regions and strong growth in the emerging economies of europe  middle east  africa and asia pacific 
upgrade revenue  which includes crossgrade revenue  decreased by during fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year  as expected 
the decrease in upgrade revenue was driven primarily from the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocad based products in fiscal as compared to the upgradeable base of our autocad based products in fiscal  due to more customers on our subscription program 
in addition  during the second half of fiscal and fiscal  autocad lt customers could crossgrade to any other product at a promotional rate  which contributed approximately million to upgrade revenue in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal we expect revenue from upgrades to continue to decline as we continue to execute on our strategy of moving customers to our subscription program 
revenue from the sales of services  training and support  included in license and other  are immaterial for all periods presented 
maintenance revenue maintenance revenue consists of revenue derived from our subscription program 
under this program  customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available  downloadable training courses and online support 
we recognize maintenance revenue from our subscription program ratably over the maintenance contract periods 
maintenance revenue increased for fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of total net revenue  maintenance revenue was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal our subscription program  available to most customers worldwide  continues to attract new and renewal customers by providing them with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new product releases and enhancements 
we expect maintenance revenue to continue to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenue as a result of increased subscription program enrollment  which is now at nearly million users  however  we expect these growth rates to be lower than in the past 
this shift away from upgrades toward a more predictable and sustainable maintenance revenue stream from the subscription program is consistent with our long term strategy 
due to the increase in our subscription base over time  the relative upgradeable installed base of the autocad based products not on subscription during fiscal was smaller than the upgradeable installed base of the autocad based products not on subscription during fiscal maintenance revenue from subscriptions substantially exceeded revenue from upgrades in fiscal aggregate backlog at january  and january  was million and million  respectively  of which million and million represented deferred revenue and million and 
table of contents million  respectively  related to current software license product orders which have not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year 
deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue from our subscription program 
to a lesser extent  deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from autodesk buzzsaw and autodesk constructware services  consulting services and deferred license sales 
backlog from current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available license software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 
net revenue by geographic area net revenue in the americas region increased by during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in maintenance revenue from our subscription program 
revenue from new seats in the americas increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal driven by new seat revenue from our d model based design products offset by a decline in new seat revenue from our d products compared to the prior fiscal year 
revenue from upgrades decreased by in the americas during fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
growth in the americas was also impacted by a slowing economy that impacted growth rates for all of our products in the fourth quarter of fiscal had exchange rates during fiscal been in effect during the same period of fiscal  translated net revenue in the americas would have been million lower in fiscal net revenue in the europe  middle east and africa emea region increased by during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in new seat revenue and increase in maintenance revenue from our subscription program 
revenue from new seats in emea increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal driven by new seat revenue from our d design products and d model based design products 
these increases were partially offset by decrease in revenue from upgrades 
emea s growth during fiscal was primarily due to growth in the local emerging economies and the united kingdom  germany  france  belgium and austria 
had exchange rates during fiscal been in effect during the same period of fiscal  translated net revenue in emea would have been million lower in fiscal net revenue in the asia pacific apac region increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in new seats revenue  a increase in maintenance revenue from our subscription program  and a increase in revenue from upgrades 
revenue from new seats in apac increased due to strong new seat revenue from our d products and d model based design products 
net revenue growth in apac during fiscal occurred primarily due to growth in the local emerging economies  japan  south korea and australia 
had exchange rates during fiscal been in effect during the same period of fiscal  translated net revenue in apac would have been million lower in fiscal we believe that international net revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue 
economic weakness in any of the countries that contributes a significant portion of our net revenue could have an adverse effect on our business in those countries 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could significantly affect our future financial results for a given period 
international net revenue represented of our net revenue in fiscal and of our net revenue in fiscal net revenue in emerging economies grew by from fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to revenue from the emea emerging economies  china and india 
this growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal net revenue by operating segment net revenue for the design solutions segment increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in new seat revenue and a increase in maintenance revenue from our subscription program 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in upgrade revenue in fiscal 
table of contents as compared to fiscal maintenance revenue increased to of design solutions segment revenue during fiscal compared to in fiscal net revenue for the media and entertainment segment increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal during fiscal  net revenue from our animation business line increased due to increases in revenue from our animation products ds max and maya 
net revenue growth from advanced systems was flat as compared to the prior fiscal year due to the migration of our advanced systems solutions from sgi hardware to pc based hardware systems which have a lower price but generate better margins 
fiscal net revenue compared to fiscal net revenue license and other revenue the increase in net revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to an increase in sales of new seats  an increase in the sales of subscription contracts which are recognized as maintenance revenue and an increase in crossgrade revenue 
revenue from the sale of new seats increased due to volume growth and higher average sales prices in our autocad  autocad lt  and our d model based design products 
in addition  the introduction of our maya and studiotools products resulting from the january acquisition of alias contributed to the growth in revenue during fiscal we experienced strong growth in all three of our geographic regions and strong growth rates in the emerging economies of asia pacific  eastern europe and the middle east  and latin america from fiscal to fiscal these increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue from upgrades resulting primarily from the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocad based products during fiscal compared to the upgradeable base of our autocad based products as of the same period in the prior fiscal year 
growth in license and other revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to an increase in the sale of commercial new seats for most major products driven by our new product releases during fiscal the increase in revenue from the sale of new seats from fiscal to fiscal was driven by volume growth in autocad  autocad lt and most major products  as well as growing sales of our d model based design products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from upgrades driven by the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocad based products in fiscal compared to the size of the upgradeable base of our autocad based products in fiscal and the success of our subscription program in fiscal revenue from the sales of services  training and support are immaterial for all periods presented 
maintenance revenue maintenance revenue from our subscription program increased for fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of total net revenue  maintenance revenue was for fiscal and for fiscal the upgradeable installed base of the autocad based products not on subscription during fiscal was smaller than the upgradeable installed base of autocad based products not on subscription during fiscal as a result  overall maintenance revenue from subscriptions exceeded revenue from upgrades in fiscal deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue from our subscription program

table of contents net revenue for the media and entertainment segment increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily from revenue increases in our animation business line  from both our january acquisition of alias and the introduction of new versions of ds max and maya products during the second quarter of fiscal although net revenue from advanced systems sales did not increase significantly during fiscal compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year  such sales progressively improved during each quarter of fiscal as a result of substantial progress made in the transition of our advanced systems product portfolio from sgi hardware to pc based hardware systems

cost of license and other revenue decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due primarily to a shift in advanced systems from sgi hardware to pc based hardware 
the increase in cost of license and other revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to higher amortization of purchased technology resulting from recent acquisitions and stock based compensation expense under sfas r  which together represented of revenue 
cost of maintenance revenue includes costs of sales associated with maintenance under our subscription program 
costs of maintenance revenue remained relatively flat during fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in cost of maintenance revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to the cessation of amortization for an information technology system supporting our subscription program  which became fully amortized during the second quarter of fiscal and which was retired from operation in the third quarter of fiscal the amortization reduction was partially offset by incremental direct program costs incurred as part of the growth of our subscription program 
cost of revenue  at least over the near term  is affected by the volume and mix of product sales  changing consulting costs  software amortization costs  royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products  new customer support offerings and the effect of expensing employee stock based compensation expense 
we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars  but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal

 fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
under fin  companies are required to recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
fin clarified how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized  provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits  and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits 
the provisions of fin were effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
based on our assessment  we recorded an increase to opening retained earnings during the first quarter of fiscal for tax benefits not previously recognized of million as a result of adopting fin

we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 
for additional information regarding our income tax provision  see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of cash is from the sale of our products 
our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employee related expenses  such as compensation and benefits  as well as general operating expenses for marketing  facilities and overhead costs 
in addition to operating expenses  we also use cash to fund our stock repurchase program and to invest in our growth initiatives  which include business acquisitions 
see further discussion of these items below 
at january   our principal sources of liquidity were cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaling million and net accounts receivable of million 
in addition  we also have available a us line of credit facility 
this line of credit permits unsecured short term borrowings of up to million  and is available for working capital or other business needs 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants which could restrict liens  certain types of additional debt and dispositions of assets if autodesk fails to maintain its financial covenants 
autodesk pays a quarterly commitment fee  ranging between  and  to maintain this facility 
this facility expires in august and there were no borrowings outstanding at january  at january   our investment portfolio included auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of million million cost basis 
autodesk s auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments that have underlying securities with contractual maturities greater than ten years and interest rates that are reset at auction every days 
these aaa rated auction rate securities  which met autodesk s investment guidelines at the time the investments were made  have failed to settle in auctions since august the failed auctions resulted in the interest rate on these investments resetting at libor plus basis points  which represents a premium interest rate on these investments 
at this time  these investments are not currently liquid  and in the event autodesk needs to access these funds  the company will not be able to do so without a loss of principal unless a future auction on these investments is successful 
autodesk has reduced the carrying value of these investments by million through other comprehensive income or loss to reflect a temporary impairment on these securities 
currently  autodesk believes these investments are temporarily impaired  but it is not clear in what period of time they will be settled 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash  the company has the intention and ability to 
table of contents hold the securities until the value recovers or to maturity 
due to the lack of liquidity of these investments  they are included in marketable securities non current 
autodesk will continue to evaluate its accounting for these investments on a quarterly basis 
see note  financial instruments  for further discussion of autodesk s financial instruments 
net cash flows provided by operating activities increased million to million during fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of million from fiscal to fiscal and improved working capital management 
net working capital changes were driven primarily by increases in accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities that increased cash flows from operations by million and million  respectively 
long term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following development of new software products and incremental product offerings resulting from the enhancement of existing products  financing anticipated growth  the share repurchase program  the acquisition of businesses  software products  or technologies complementary to our business  and capital expenditures  including the purchase and implementation of internal use software applications 
in addition  million of our marketable securities are held in a rabbi trust under non qualified deferred compensation plans as of january  see note  deferred compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we use foreign currency option contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments  primarily certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency instruments  by policy  have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period 
the principal currencies hedged during fiscal were the euro  british pound  japanese yen  swiss franc and canadian dollar 
we monitor our foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at january  total fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years thereafter in millions operating lease obligations purchase obligations total total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet or certain purchase obligations as discussed below 
the table also excludes our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with fin  which totaled million as of january   since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities 
see note income taxes to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 

table of contents purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies  services and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies  services or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  in most instances  the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
in addition  we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue 
royalty expense  included in cost of license and other revenue  was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal principal commitments at january  shown above consist of obligations under operating leases for facilities and computer equipment  it infrastructure costs  marketing costs and contractual development costs 
purchase commitments also include million related to a termination fee for an outsource application hosting services agreement entered into during fiscal this fee is reduced as time elapses during the five year contract period 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees  including limited product warranties 
historically  costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant  but because potential future costs are highly variable  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any variable interest entities 
as of january  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
stock compensation as of january   we maintained two active stock option plans for the purpose of granting stock options to employees and non employee members of autodesk s board of directors board the employee stock plan plan  which is available only to employees  and the directors option plan  as amended plan  which is available only to non employee directors 
additionally  there are seven expired or terminated plans with options outstanding  including the stock plan which was replaced by the employee stock plan in march the plan  which was approved by autodesk s stockholders on november   reserved million shares of autodesk common stock plus million shares that remained available for issuance under the stock plan upon its expiration  for issuance under the plan 
at january   million shares were available for future issuance under this plan

the plan reserves million shares of autodesk common stock  plus million shares that remained available for issuance under the stock plan upon its expiration  for issuance under that plan 
the plan will permit the grant of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  however  no more than million of the shares reserved for issuance under the plan may be issued for awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units 
the plan will expire in march our stock option program is broad based and designed to promote long term retention 
essentially all of our employees participate 
approximately of the options we granted during fiscal were awarded to employees other than our ceo  cfo and the three other most highly compensated officers for fiscal  which we refer to as our named executive officers 
options granted under our equity plans during fiscal vest over periods ranging from one to four years and expire within six to ten years of the date of grant 
since march  the exercise price of all stock options granted is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant date 
all stock option grants to executive officers are made by the compensation and human resources committee of the board of directors 
all members of the compensation and human resources committee are independent directors  as defined by the listing standards of the nasdaq global select market 
grants to our non employee directors are non discretionary and are pre determined by the terms of the plan 
for further information concerning autodesk s policies and procedures regarding the use of stock options  see compensation discussion and analysis incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled executive compensation  in our proxy statement for our fiscal year annual meeting of stockholders to be filed with the securities and exchange commission not later than days after the fiscal year ended january  in addition to our stock option plans  our employees are also eligible to participate in autodesk s employee qualified stock purchase plan esp plan 
eligible employees may purchase shares of autodesk s common stock at their discretion using up to of their compensation subject to certain limitations  at not less than of fair market value as defined in the plan agreement 
at january   million shares were available for future issuance 
this amount will automatically be increased on the first trading day of each fiscal year by an amount equal to the lesser of million shares or of the total outstanding shares plus any shares repurchased by autodesk during the prior fiscal year 
we typically issue shares on march and september of each fiscal year 
the provisions of this plan expire during fiscal on august   autodesk disclosed that the audit committee of the board of directors was conducting a voluntary review of autodesk s historical stock option granting practices and related accounting issues 
due to this review  autodesk was not current with its reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of until june  and suspended contributions and purchases under the esp plan during the third quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal on september   autodesk s board of directors approved an amendment to the company s esp plan which provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period  unless they elected not to participate 
the board of directors also approved a one time cash bonus of million to non executive employees enrolled in the esp plan at that date 
this bonus approximated the profits employee participants would have made on the scheduled september  exercise date  had the purchases been made and the shares been sold on the next trading day at close of market  and was expensed as additional compensation expense at the time it was paid 
on march   autodesk s board of directors approved an amendment  which superseded the september  amendment  which provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period ending in september  unless they elected not to participate 
in june the company became current with its financial filings and resumed employee contributions to the esp plan

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our revenue  earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations  but such contracts do not extend beyond the current quarter 
contracts are primarily denominated in euros  british pounds  japanese yen  swiss francs  and canadian dollars 
we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
autodesk utilizes foreign currency option collar contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions 
a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january  indicated that a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january  would increase the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by million 
a hypothetical depreciation of the dollar from its value at january  would decrease the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by million 
the results of the sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january  indicated that a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january  would have increased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by million and a hypothetical depreciation of the dollar from its value at january  would have increased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by million 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts
