item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview align technology  inc  founded in april  designs  manufactures and markets invisalign  a proprietary method for treating malocclusion  or the misalignment of teeth 
invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear  nearly invisible  removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position 
because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires  invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces 
we received the united states food and drug administration fda clearance to market invisalign in  and we began commercial operations and sales of full invisalign treatment in july each invisalign treatment plan is unique to the individual patient 
our full invisalign treatment consists of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck in order to achieve the doctors treatment goals 
our invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten aligners 
invisalign express treatment is intended to assist dental professionals to treat a broader range of patients by providing a lower cost option for adult relapse cases  minor crowding and spacing or as a pre cursor to restorative or cosmetic treatment such as veneers 
a number of factors  the most important of which are set forth below  may affect our results during and beyond 
product innovation new products and enhancements to existing products 
we believe that product performance and innovation is a cornerstone to our future long term growth by driving and sustaining product adoption and enhancing the user experience and thereby increasing utilization growth 
currently  the invisalign system is a single system used by both gps and orthodontists 
we are committed to delivering new products and introducing new product features to better meet the needs of our two customers orthodontists and gps each with distinct and separate needs 
orthodontists want a more robust set of tools for greater predictability  wider applicability and more flexibility in the use of the invisalign system 
on the other hand  typical gps want greater ease of use  more efficient and simplified diagnostic tools  guidance through the case set up process  minimal treatment intervention and self help tools designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to moderate malocclusion 
based on this knowledge  we announced the anticipated release of two products invisalign teen in the latter half of and invisalign clinassist in the latter half of or early invisalign teen will include features such as an aligner wear indicator to help gauge patient compliance and specially engineered aligner features to address the natural eruption of key teeth and root control issues common in teen patients 
predominately marketed to orthodontists who treat the vast majority of malocclusion in teen patients  these features make it easier and more efficient for orthodontists to treat those younger patients 
invisalign clinassist is the first phase of our gp specific product platform and is being designed as a turnkey  consultative approach to invisalign treatment for doctors who want a highly efficient treatment process with built in monitoring tools and progress tracking 
we believe continuing to introduce new products and product features as well as enhancing the user experience will keep us at the forefront of the market and increase demand for invisalign 
the planned roll out of invisalign clinassist and invisalign teen and other future products will rely on new features  tools and delivery options to meet specific clinical demands while providing a family of end to end solutions for our customers 
we believe enhanced product performance and innovation will continue to drive the adoption and frequency of use what we call utilization  and increase customer productivity resulting in increased demand for invisalign and market share expansion 
however  with the anticipated introduction of invisalign teen  our invisalign product family will for the first time include a product designed to meet the specific needs of the non adult comprehensive  or teen  treatment market 
specifically  those individuals who have shed their baby teeth but do not yet have fully erupted mature dentition 
teen patients make up the majority of most orthodontists case starts 
as a result  launching a teen specific product will make the invisalign system more applicable to an orthodontist s patient base  which we believe we are better positioned to increase our penetration into and our share of the non adult comprehensive  or teen  treatment market 
increase customer adoption and utilization 
by first increasing adoption through the expansion of our customer base and then increasing utilization by offering new products and feature enhancements to meet the needs of orthodontists and gps  we believe the overall market for invisalign and our share of that market will increase 
although we expect that over the long term our utilization rates will gradually improve  we expect that period over period comparisons of our utilization rates will fluctuate 
our quarterly utilization rates for the years ended december  and are as follows utilization rates graphic utilization rates of cases shipped of doctors cases were shipped to training new orthodontists and general practitioners 
expanding our customer base through training is a key part of our strategy 
through december   we have trained  gps and  orthodontists in the united states and  doctors internationally 
in addition  by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique  we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option 
in  we trained approximately  gps and orthodontists worldwide  and expect to train a comparable amount in currently  we have incorporated the invisalign technique into the curriculum of university programs 
we expect additional dental schools to integrate the invisalign technique into their curricula in the future 
focus on education and customer support 
in order to build long term relationships with our customers and increase utilization  we focus on providing ongoing training  support and services 
in early  we announced the introduction of the aligntech institute program brand  which consolidates our extensive clinical education programs under a new interactive website that will provide clinical education and practice development training opportunities for our invisalign trained doctors 
these practice development training opportunities will include instructor led certification classes  seminars and workshops  conference calls  web based videos  case studies  and other clinical resources 
many of these courses and resources are eligible for continuing education ce credits 
by participating in these events  we believe that our customers will emerge with a better understanding of the product and its applicability  and with a greater aptitude for starting and finishing invisalign cases successfully 
the cornerstone of our clinical education program is www 
aligntechinstitute 
com  which provides information and registration for our training workshops  conference calls and seminars and provides an extensive range of case studies  best practices  testimonials and online coursework to ensure treatment success and improve practice economics 
our vip portal virtual invisalign practice provides our trained doctors and their staff access to thousands of invisalign cases and best practices as well as up to date support information  programs and marketing materials for continuous support and information access 
stimulate demand for invisalign treatment increasing our patient base 
marketing to the consumer and creating demand is one of our key strategic objectives to driving long term growth 
our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations  such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort 
by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers  we intend to increase the number of patients who seek invisalign treatment annually 
in  we expect to increase our overall marketing spending in the united states with a focus on programs such as advertising and digital online media  designed to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced doctors 
we also intend to initiate similar consumer marketing efforts  but on a smaller scale  in key european countries 
similar to  we will continue to conduct advertising and consumer marketing activities involving television  radio  print media and our consumer website in we anticipate that this increased consumer awareness of invisalign will increase the demand for our product 
product mix 
during  we experienced a decline in the number of invisalign express cases compared to the same period of we believe that this shift in product mix began in the fourth quarter of after we removed the cancellation fees on full invisalign cases prior to clincheck approval and clarified clinical protocols surrounding what is an appropriate invisalign express case 
for the years ended december   and  our invisalign revenues as a percentage of total net revenues are as follows years ended december  revenues by channel north american invisalign full revenues express revenues total north american invisalign revenues international invisalign revenues other revenues total net revenues invisalign express was launched in the third quarter of we recently launched vivera retainers and have announced the planned launch of invisalign teen and invisalign clinassist 
as a result of and depending upon the timing of these new product launches as well as the timing of customer adoption  we expect our mix of products to begin shifting gradually in the latter part of and into key features of these new products  include staged delivery of aligners with invisalign clinassist and three free replacement aligners will be included in invisalign teen 
as a result of these features  these new products will have a significantly higher amount of deferred revenue as a percentage of their average selling price  compared to our current products 
included in the price of full invisalign treatment  we offer case refinement  which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient s teeth to the desired final position 
each of invisalign teen and invisalign clinassist include the deferral for case refinement 
in addition  however  revenue for the three replacement aligners included in invisalign teen will be deferred based on their fair market value until the earlier of replacement aligners being used or until the case is completed 
invisalign clinassist will be invoiced upon the first staged shipment and revenue will be deferred to the balance sheet and recognized upon shipment of the final staged shipment 
the vivera retainer subscription includes four shipments per year 
our customers will be invoiced upon the first shipment and revenue will be recognized ratably over the one year subscription period 
as these new products increase as a percentage of our revenues in the latter part of  deferred revenue on our balance sheet will increase 
growth of international markets 
we will continue to focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of invisalign by dental professionals in our key international markets  europe and japan 
we will consider expanding to additional countries on a case by case basis 
we expect our international revenues to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in the foreseeable future 
reliance on international manufacturing operations 
our manufacturing efficiency has been and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability 
currently  two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica  dental technicians use a sophisticated  internally developed computer modeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans 
these electronic treatment plans form the basis of clincheck and are used to manufacture aligner molds 
in addition  we use international manufacturing solutions operaciones  srl ims  a third party based in juarez  mexico  for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 
our success will depend in part on the efforts and abilities of management to effectively manage these international operations  including our relationship with ims 
in addition  we currently are and will continue to be dependent on ims s and our ability to hire and retain employees generally  as well as hire and retain employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations 
if our management or ims fail in any of these respects  we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 
in addition  even if we have case submissions  we may not have a sufficient number of trained dental technicians in costa rica to create the clincheck treatment forms  or if ims is unable to ship our product to our customers on a timely basis  our revenue will be delayed or lost  which will cause our operating results to fluctuate 
see item a risk factors for risks related to our international operations 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values over the requisite service period 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our financial statements for the prior periods have not been restated to reflect and do not include the impact of fas r 
for the years ended december  and  stock based compensation expense recognized in accordance with fas r is as follows in thousands year ended december  year ended december  stock based compensation of net revenues stock based compensation of net revenues cost of revenues sales and marketing   general and administrative   research and development   total stock based compensation expense   results of operations comparison of years ended december   and net revenues invisalign product revenues by channel and other revenues  which represent training and sales of ancillary products for the years ended december   and  are as follows years ended december  net revenues change change change change in millions north america ortho full ortho express total ortho revenues gp full gp express total gp revenues total north american invisalign international invisalign total invisalign revenues other revenues total net revenues invisalign express was launched in the third quarter of case volume data which represents invisalign case shipments by channel  for the years ended december   and are as follows years ended december  invisalign case volume change change change change in thousands north america ortho full ortho express total ortho volume gp full gp express total gp volume total north american invisalign international invisalign total invisalign case volume invisalign express was launched in the third quarter of revenues from both our north american orthodontic and gp channels increased in compared to primarily as a result of an overall increase in case volume and a favorable product mix shift towards full invisalign 
this product mix shift towards full invisalign began in the fourth quarter of after we removed the cancellation fees on full invisalign cases prior to clincheck approval and clarified clinical protocols surrounding what is an appropriate invisalign express case 
the increase in full invisalign revenues is partially offset by a lower average selling price  which is due to the increased participation in our volume based discount programs 
revenues from our north american orthodontic channel decreased million or in compared to as a result of a decline in full invisalign revenues of million partially offset by a million increase in invisalign express revenues 
the decline in full invisalign revenues is attributed to lower average selling prices and case volumes 
in the reduced average selling price of the full invisalign product reflects the full year impact of pricing initiatives introduced in the second half of  including the reduction in the list price of our full invisalign product and the expansion of our volume based discount program 
additionally  the increase in invisalign express revenue resulted from higher case volumes in compared to  since this product was launched in the third quarter of revenues from our north american gp channel increased million or in compared to primarily due to an increase in invisalign express revenues of million partially offset by a million decline in full invisalign revenues 
the increase in invisalign express revenues resulted from higher case volumes in compared to  since this product was launched in the third quarter of the reduction in full invisalign revenues is attributed to lower average selling prices which reflect the full year impact of the pricing initiatives mentioned above 
the increase in our international invisalign revenues in compared to was attributable to an increase in case volume 
additionally  our international revenues benefited from favorable exchange rates against the us dollar in these increases were partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price due to the increased participation in volume based discount programs 
international revenues increased million or in compared to primarily due to a significant increase in our international invisalign case volumes partially offset by a lower average selling price as a result of pricing initiatives introduced in the first quarter of other revenues  consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products  were higher in compared to as a result of an increased number of doctors trained year over year 
other revenues increased during compared to primarily from an increase in the list price for training 
for  we expect our total net revenues to increase compared to primarily due to case volume increases in our north american orthodontic and gp channels  as well as in our international markets 
we expect our average selling price in to be comparable to we recently launched vivera retainers and have announced the planned launch of invisalign teen and invisalign clinassist 
as a result of and depending upon the timing of these new product launches as well as the timing of customer adoption  we expect our mix of products to begin shifting gradually in the latter part of and into key features of these new products include staged delivery of aligners with invisalign clinassist and three free replacement aligners with invisalign teen 
as a result of these features  these new products will have a significantly higher amount of deferred revenue as a percentage of their average selling price  compared to our current products 
cost of revenues and gross margin years ended december  change change in millions cost of revenues of net revenues gross profit gross margin cost of revenues includes salaries for staff involved in the production process  costs incurred by ims  a third party shelter service provider in juarez  mexico  the cost of materials  packaging  shipping costs  depreciation on capital equipment used in the production process  training costs and stock based compensation expense 
gross margin improved in compared to primarily as a result of increased case volume over our relatively fixed cost structure 
our case volume increased in compared to  resulting in decreases in our per unit standard cost 
additionally  cost reductions resulting from improved operating efficiencies also contributed to the increase in gross margin 
gross margin decreased in compared to primarily due to lower average selling prices attributable to the reduction in the list price of full invisalign and increased sales of our lower priced invisalign express product 
this decrease was partially offset by the reductions in product costs driven by increased volumes and manufacturing efficiencies including the relocation of the sla mold operations to juarez  mexico 
we anticipate our gross margin in to be comparable to sales and marketing years ended december  change change in millions sales and marketing of net revenues sales and marketing expense includes sales force compensation including travel related costs  marketing personnel related costs  media and advertising  clinical education  product marketing and stock based compensation expense 
our sales and marketing expense increased during compared to predominately as a result of a million increase in media  advertising and product marketing expenses and a million increase in personnel related expenses 
the increase in personnel related expenses primarily resulted from a million increase in salaries  benefits and overhead attributable to additional headcount and a million increase in stock based compensation 
sales and marketing expense increased in compared to primarily due to a million increase in payroll expense mainly attributable to an increase in headcount  including the replacement of orthodontic sales representatives who left align in the first half of  and a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in media  advertising and other marketing expenses due to the initial launch of our consumer marketing campaign in the second quarter of for  we expect sales and marketing expense  including stock based compensation  to be higher than in  as we expanded our north american sales force in late and anticipate expanding our international sales force in in addition  we expect to increase marketing spending in the united states and europe with a focus on consumer advertising  including television  digital online  and print media  and we will incur additional costs in the united states related to bringing new products to market  such as vivera  invisalign teen and invisalign clinassist 
general and administrative years ended december  change change in millions general and administrative of net revenues general and administrative expense includes salaries for administrative personnel  outside consulting services  legal expenses and stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expense decreased in compared to largely due to a million decline in external legal fees following the settlement of the orthoclear litigation in the fourth quarter of our legal expense includes a million credit for an insurance reimbursement of legal costs also associated with the orthoclear litigation 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in additional headcount and incentive compensation  a million increase in consulting fees  and a increase in stock based compensation expense 
additionally  amortization expense increased million in compared to related to the amortization of the non compete agreements we received in connection with the orthoclear settlement 
general and administrative expense increased in compared to primarily due to a million increase in external legal fees primarily related to the orthoclear litigation  a million increase in payroll related expenses primarily resulting from the hiring of additional legal and administrative staff  and a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
for  we expect general and administrative expense  including stock based compensation  to be higher than as we continue to build our information technology infrastructure and focus on training and organizational development 
research and development years ended december  change change in millions research and development of net revenues research and development expense includes the personnel related costs and outside consulting expenses associated with the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products  conducting clinical and post marketing trials and stock based compensation expense 
research and development expense increased in compared to predominantly from a million increase resulting from higher headcount and incentive compensation 
additionally  a million increase in outside services also contributed to the increase in research and development costs 
research and development expense decreased slightly in compared to  primarily due to a million decrease in temporary services and outside consulting expenses partially offset by a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
for  we expect research and development spending to increase from as we continue to invest in bringing new products to market  conducting clinical research and focusing on product development and enhancements 
patients first program and settlement costs years ended december  change change in millions patients first program settlement costs total patients first program and settlement costs of net revenues as part of the orthoclear agreement in october  orthoclear agreed to stop the importation of aligners into the united states and discontinue all aligner business operations worldwide 
as a result  most orthoclear patients were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment with orthoclear 
in an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for the orthoclear patients and their doctors  we committed to make treatment available to these patients at no additional cost under the patients first program 
we received no revenue for the program  and incurred significant expense to complete these cases 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an million charge for the anticipated costs of completing this program in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
this estimated amount was based on the number of orthoclear cases registered under the patients first program as of december  in accordance with the patients first program terms and conditions  those registered cases were required to be received by march  in the first quarter of  we reduced our patients first program accrual by million to reflect a reduction of our initial estimate to the number of cases actually received by the case submission deadline 
we shipped virtually all patients first program cases during the first half of we paid million to orthoclear during the fourth quarter of in accordance with the terms of the orthoclear agreement  of which million was capitalized on our balance sheet representing the fair value of the non compete agreements and is being amortized over years 
in accordance with emerging issues task force accounting for pre existing contractual relationships between the parties to a purchase business combination eitf  we recorded the remaining million as settlement costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest and other income expense  net years ended december  change change in millions interest income interest expense other income expense  net total interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  includes interest income earned on cash balances  interest expense on debt  foreign currency translation gains and losses and other miscellaneous charges 
interest income for the year ended december  increased compared to primarily due to higher average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in the increase in interest income compared to was attributable to higher effective interest rates 
other income expense  net  decreased in compared to reflecting the decrease in foreign currency translation gains 
in january  we began to record the adjustments from translating certain european subsidiaries financial statements from the local currency into the us dollar as a separate component of shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under the heading currency rate risk for additional information on the change in functional currency 
other income expense  net  increased million in compared to  primarily due to a million increase in foreign currency translation gains resulting primarily from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
income tax provision years ended december  change change in millions provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million for  million for and million for  representing effective tax rates of   and  respectively 
as of december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing deferred tax assets due to uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize these assets before they expire 
as a result  our income tax provision is based upon our operating results for each taxable jurisdiction in which we operate and the amount of statutory tax that we incur in each jurisdiction 
we exercise significant judgment in regards to estimates of future market growth  forecasted earnings and projected taxable income  in determining the provision for income taxes  and for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from deferred tax assets 
we have historically experienced operating losses and have significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have considered our future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing our valuation allowance 
future taxable income is based upon our estimates  and actual results may significantly differ from these estimates 
if in the future we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of the net amount recorded  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance  increasing income in the period such determination was made 
subsequently  we would record a tax provision that approximates the blended statutory tax rate 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes and million for california state tax purposes 
if not utilized  these carryforwards will begin to expire in for federal purposes and for california purposes 
fas r prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable 
such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled million as of december  and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital  if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable 
the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the use of a corporation s tax attributes if a corporation undergoes an ownership change for tax purposes 
if an ownership change is determined to have occurred  our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation 
however  based on our current estimate of the total net operating losses at december  and our current estimate of the annual limitation  we do not expect our net operating loss carryforwards to be limited 
at december   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal purposes and million for california state tax purposes 
if not utilized  the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
we have not provided additional us income taxes on undistributed earnings from non us operations as of december  because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations from product sales  the proceeds of the sale of our common stock  and from occasional borrowings under our available credit facility 
as of december   and  we had the following cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments years ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents    restricted cash short term investments   total    net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended was million  resulting primarily from our net income of million and non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  and amortization of intangibles totaling million 
additionally  a million increase in accounts payable also contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities 
these increases in cash flows from operating activities were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  resulting primarily from our net loss of million and non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  and amortization of intangibles totaling million 
additionally  a million increase in current assets and a million reduction in deferred revenue partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities also contributed to the cash used in operating activities 
the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to the million accrual as of december  for the anticipated costs of completing the patients first program 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   which largely consisted of million of net purchases of short term marketable securities and million used for the purchase of capital assets 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to a million purchase of intangible assets resulting from the orthoclear agreement  million for the purchase of capital assets and million for net purchases of short term marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   which consisted of million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock  primarily from exercises of employee stock options 
this increase was partially offset by the repayment of million against the outstanding balance on our line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and consisted of million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock  primarily from exercises of employee stock options and million in net borrowings from our line of credit 
net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity 
however  in  we began granting restricted stock units rsus which  unlike stock options  do not generate cash from exercise 
as a result  we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods 
in addition  because rsus are taxable to the individuals when they vest  the number of shares we issue to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf 
during  we paid million of taxes related to rsus that vested during the period for executive officers 
on march   we renegotiated and amended our existing credit facility with comerica bank 
the amendment  among other things  reduced financial covenants to require only a quick ratio covenant 
effective january   the amendment automatically increased the available borrowings under the existing revolving line of credit from million to million 
the amended credit facility matures on december  at which point all outstanding borrowings on this credit facility must be repaid 
during  we repaid million of our outstanding borrowings under this credit facility 
as of december   we have no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and we are in compliance with the financial covenant of this credit facility 
contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations    computer support services  total    we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k item a as of december  we expect that our expense levels for will be higher compared to due to increases in our level of business activity 
we expect to increase sales and marketing spending as we expand our sales force and focus on consumer advertising and the launch of new products 
in addition  we expect to incur additional research and development costs as we continue to invest in product development and enhancements 
we also expect increases in our general and administrative expenses as we continue to enhance our information technology infrastructure and business applications 
in addition  we may use cash to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 
our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our ability to market  sell and support our products on a worldwide basis 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows  we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy  business structure or operations 
accordingly  the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into arrangements to sell products and services that contain multiple elements or multiple deliverables of products in the future 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are recognized from product sales  net of discounts and rebates 
service revenues are recorded when performance is completed 
for revenue arrangements with multiple elements  we use verifiable objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the undelivered elements and recognize the residual revenue for the delivered items upon shipment 
revenues for the undelivered elements are deferred based on a historical utilization rate  or breakage factor  and are recognized when delivery occurs 
actual utilization rates could differ from the historical breakage factor requiring future adjustments to revenue 
in addition  changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition but would not change the total revenue recognized 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
revised  share based payment fas r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under this method  we recognize stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted after january  and granted prior to but not yet vested as of december   in accordance with fas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  we recognize stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognize compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to fas r adoption  we accounted for share based payment awards under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and  accordingly  recognized compensation expense only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price 
in conjunction with the adoption of fas r  we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation expense from the accelerated multiple option approach to the straight line single option method 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of fas r and the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected term and stock price volatility 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
see note stockholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
on october   the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting for all unvested stock options with exercise prices greater than 
options held by non employee directors were excluded from the vesting acceleration 
the fair market value of our common stock on the date of acceleration was as quoted on the nasdaq global market 
as a result of the acceleration  approximately million options or of the then total outstanding options became immediately exercisable as of october  the purpose of the acceleration was to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our statement of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of fas r 
long lived assets  including finite lived purchased intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives  unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 
we perform an impairment test whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or circumstances include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for its business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses 
no intangible asset impairment was recorded for the periods presented 
deferred tax valuation allowance we have established a full valuation allowance because we believe the realization of our deferred tax assets is not likely 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we exercise significant judgment in regards to estimates of future market growth  forecasted earnings and projected taxable income  in determining the provision for income taxes  and for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from deferred tax assets 
we have historically experienced operating losses and have significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have considered our future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing our valuation allowance 
future taxable income is based upon our estimates  and actual results may significantly differ from these estimates 
if in the future we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of the net amount recorded  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance  increasing income in the period such determination was made

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
our cash equivalents and investments are in fixed rate  short term securities 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  and as a result  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had million invested in available for sale marketable securities 
an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 
we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december  and therefore  we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate decreases 
currency rate risk we operate in north america  europe  asia pacific  costa rica and japan 
as a result of our international business activities  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets  and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future 
we sell our products in the local currency for the respective country 
this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below 
regardless of this natural hedging  our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  where appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions 
the impact of an aggregate decline of in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material 
prior to january   the functional currency of align and our subsidiaries was the us dollar  and accordingly  gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in euros  costa rican colones  and other currencies were reflected in other income expense 
during the first quarter of  we analyzed the various economic factors of our international subsidiaries in accordance with fas and determined that there had been a significant change in facts and circumstances to warrant a change in the functional currency for some of our european subsidiaries from the us dollar to the local currency 
effective january   the adjustment from translating certain european subsidiaries financial statements from the local currency into the us dollar was recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net in the stockholder s equity section of our consolidated balance sheets
