item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview market conditions were mixed during  with growing demand in some markets and regions and weak demand in other markets and regions 
net sales increased  primarily as a result of price increases and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales growth was the strongest in our color and glass performance materials and performance coatings segments 
sales also increased in our electronic materials and polymer additives segments  and declined in specialty plastics 
sales in the electronic materials segment were affected by weak customer demand for dielectric materials in the first half of the year  but demand was stronger in the last two quarters of demand for products from our polymer additives and specialty plastics segments was affected by reduced demand from north american customers who serve the residential housing  appliance and automotive markets 
beyond fundamental product demand  the factors that most influenced results included the following increased and volatile raw material costs  and our inability to raise selling prices to maintain our profitability  cost control initiatives  including costs associated with restructuring programs  and unplanned manufacturing costs required to improve production processes  meet product specification requirements or recover from equipment malfunctions and operating errors 
prices for a number of raw materials increased significantly during the year  including bismuth  chrome oxide  cobalt  lithium carbonate  nickel  polypropylene  soybean oil  and tallow 
these increases contributed to increased manufacturing costs for the year 
in some cases  because of the rapid pace of these costs increases  we instituted 
table of contents product price surcharges to provide more rapid price adjustments 
while these surcharges generally allow us to pass specific raw material cost increases through to customers  they do not generally allow us to maintain our gross margin as a percent of sales as costs increase 
during the year  we were also able to reformulate some products with alternatives that used less costly raw materials 
in some cases  we also employed hedging and other procurement strategies to mitigate the effects of higher raw material costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs increased at a rate less than the increase in our sales 
as a result  sg a expense as a percent of sales declined in compared with an impairment charge related to goodwill and other long lived assets in our polymer additives and pharmaceuticals businesses was recorded during the impairment in the polymer additives business was triggered by the cumulative negative effect on earnings of a cyclical downturn in certain of the business primary us based end markets  including housing and automobiles  anticipated additional product costs due to recent hazardous material legislation and regulations  such as the newly enacted european union reach registration system  which requires chemical suppliers to perform toxicity studies on the components of their products and to register certain information  and higher forecasted capital expenditures related to the business 
the impairment charge in the pharmaceutical business is primarily the result of the longer time necessary to transition the business from a supplier of food supplements and additives to a supplier of high value pharmaceutical products and services 
restructuring charges continued in  primarily related to manufacturing rationalization in our inorganic materials manufacturing operations in europe and our electronic materials production capacity in the united states 
interest expense declined in compared with during the first quarter of we were able to eliminate most of the requirement for cash deposits related to the precious metals used in our products 
this reduced our borrowing requirements  and drove the decline in interest expense for the year 
the decline in cash deposits also lowered interest income for the year 
income before income taxes declined in compared with the decline was primarily driven by the impairment charges  increased sg a expense and lower interest earned  partially offset by lower interest expense and restructuring charges 
the loss from continuing operations was driven by the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter 
during  balance sheet debt declined as both long term debt and loans payable and current portion of long term debt declined 
the decline was driven by the reduction of borrowing required for cash deposits for precious metals  increased accounts payable and lower inventories  partially offset by increased net trade receivables 
cash deposits were eliminated during the year  a decline of million from the end of the reduction in cash deposits and inventory  and the increase in accounts payable contributed to increased net cash provided by operating activities 
also during  capital expenditures increased by million to million  as we invested for plant maintenance  current and anticipated sales growth and in projects related to our manufacturing rationalization programs in the united states and europe 
outlook general economic conditions continue to be mixed  depending on the region and applications addressed 
demand from markets in the united states that are related to residential housing  automobiles and appliances is expected to continue to be weak  as it has been since late this weakness is expected to continue at least through the first half of  and will continue to negatively affect sales  particularly in our specialty plastics  polymer additives  color and glass performance materials  and performance coatings segments 
in december  we experienced unexpected operational issues at our bridgeport  new jersey  organic chemicals manufacturing facility  resulting in a temporary interruption of production and added costs related to scrapped product and wastewater treatment 
production interruptions related to restarting the plant s wastewater treatment capability continued into the first quarter of and are expected to result in incremental pretax costs and expenses of approximately million during the first quarter 
normal manufacturing production has resumed at the site

changes in exchange rates contributed somewhat less than half of the increase in sales 
sales growth in europe  asia and latin america was partially offset by a decline of less than one percent in sales in the united states 
gross profit increased slightly in compared with  although the increase in gross profit was limited by increased cost of sales  which grew at a faster rate than sales primarily due to increased raw material costs 
as a result  gross margin percentage declined for the year 
gross profit was reduced by million in primarily as a result of charges for accelerated depreciation and other costs associated with our manufacturing rationalization programs 
in addition  gross profit was negatively impacted by unplanned manufacturing costs due to temporary interruptions in operations at our manufacturing facilities in south plainfield  new jersey  and bridgeport  new jersey  and increased costs required to address product specification requirements at our evansville  indiana  specialty plastics manufacturing location 
higher precious metal prices during reduced our gross margin percentage  because increases in precious metal prices are generally passed through to customers with minimal gross profit contribution

an impairment charge of million related to goodwill and other long lived assets was recorded in related to our polymer additives and pharmaceuticals businesses 
the impairment in the polymer additives business was primarily the result of the cumulative negative effect on earnings of a cyclical downturn in certain of the business primary us based end markets  including housing and automobiles  anticipated additional product costs due to recent hazardous material legislation and regulations  such as the newly enacted european union reach registration system  which requires chemical suppliers to perform toxicity studies on the components of their products and to register certain information  and higher forecasted capital expenditures related to the business 
the impairment charge in the pharmaceutical business was primarily the result of the longer time necessary to transition the business from a supplier of food supplements and additives to a supplier of high value pharmaceutical products and services 
there were no impairment charges in restructuring charges of million were recorded in  primarily associated with our manufacturing rationalization activities in the performance coatings and color and glass performance materials segments in europe and our electronic materials segment in the united states 
restructuring charges of million in were primarily related to the same manufacturing rationalization activities 
interest expense declined in primarily as a result of lower debt levels and lower interest rates resulting from the renegotiation of our credit facilities and accounts receivables securitization program during the second quarter 
the lower debt levels were driven by the elimination of cash deposits for precious metals  which occurred during the first half of the year 
the interest expense included a million write off of unamortized fees associated with an unused portion of our term loan arrangements 
interest expense in included a million write off of fees and discounts related to certain of our debentures that were repaid in july and august and previously unamortized fees related to our former revolving credit facility

electronic materials segment results 
sales grew in electronic materials as a result of improved customer demand in the second half of the year 
demand for dielectric materials  which had been weak in the first half of the year  recovered in the second half 
demand for conductive pastes used by customers who manufacture solar cells was particularly strong in the second half of the year 
the primary drivers for the increased sales were increased market demand  higher precious metal prices and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales increases were primarily in asia and europe  while sales in the united states were slightly lower 
operating income declined as a result of higher raw material costs that were not fully offset by the positive effects of increased manufacturing volume 
in addition  in april  production was temporarily interrupted at our south plainfield  new jersey  manufacturing plant to address operational and safety concerns 
this production interruption added approximately million to manufacturing costs for the year

because of an accidental discharge of product into the plant s on site watewater treatment facility  we incurred unplanned costs of approximately million during the fourth quarter  including the costs of scrapped product and added wastewater treatment 
specialty plastics segment results 
sales declined primarily as a result of weak demand from customers who make products used in residential housing  automotive and appliance markets in the united states 
this weak demand resulted in lower sales in the united states  which were partially offset by sales growth in europe 
partially offsetting the effects of lower volumes were increased product pricing and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales of plastic colorants increased during  while sales of filled and reinforced plastics declined 
operating income increased as a result of improved pricing and lower selling  general and administrative expenses  partially offset by higher raw material costs and the negative effects of lower manufacturing volume 
operating income was also reduced by added costs required to address product specification issues at our evansville  indiana  plant

sales growth was strong in north america  europe and latin america  while overall sales in asia declined modestly 
growth in asia was negatively impacted by natural gas supply issues in indonesia  which affected both our own and our customers manufacturing operations 
favorable currency exchange rates also contributed to the sales increase for the year 
operating income increased during primarily because pricing was increased in excess of raw material cost increases 
in addition  the mix of products was more favorable  particularly in our porcelain enamel business 
electronic materials segment results 
sales in electronic materials were sharply higher for the year due to strong customer demand for metal pastes for solar cells and materials for multilayer capacitors  compared with when customers demand was weak for capacitor materials in the first half of the year 
in addition  higher precious metals prices  which are passed through to customers  contributed to the sales increase

comparing to  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by the increase in net income of million  supplemented by increased proceeds from the asset securitization program of million  an increase in non cash restructuring charges of million and changes in other working capital items of million 
the other reconciling items primarily had positive impacts to operating cash flows and related to deferred income taxes  retirement benefits and increased depreciation expense of million primarily due to accelerated depreciation 
offsetting these positive cash flow items were increased changes in deposit requirements under the company s precious metals consignment program of million  increased changes in inventories of million  and increased changes in accounts receivable of million 
the increase

in  we amended the credit facility  increasing it to million 
it now consists of a five year  million multi currency senior revolving credit facility and a six year  million senior term loan facility 
in  we had net repayments of these facilities of million  while in  we had net borrowings of million  for a net decrease in our rate of borrowing of million 
in  we had net borrowings of million from these facilities  so the net decrease in in our rate of borrowing was million 
in addition  we paid million in to amend the facility and million in to establish and use the facility  while in we did not pay any debt issue costs 
we also continued to pay dividends on our common stock at our historical quarterly rate of per share  totaling million in capital resources and liquidity credit rating in may  moody s investor services  inc moody s reassigned a senior credit rating to the company after withdrawing its rating in march due to delays in the filing of financial statements for and quarterly statements for through at december   the company s senior credit rating was b  with a positive outlook  by moody s and b  with a stable outlook  by standard poor s rating group s p

in addition  we can request an increase of million in the revolving credit facility 
in january  we borrowed million of our term loan facility and used the proceeds to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at that time  we also cancelled the remaining unused term loan commitment of million  which was reserved to finance the potential accelerated payment of the senior notes  since the default under the senior notes was no longer continuing 
in the second quarter of  we began making periodic principal payments on the term loans 
at december   we had borrowed million in term loans

we sell  on an ongoing basis  substantially all of ferro s us trade accounts receivable under an asset securitization program 
this program  which expires in  accelerates cash collections at favorable financing costs and helps us manage the company s liquidity requirements 
we sell these trade accounts receivable to ferro finance corporation ffc  a wholly owned unconsolidated qualified special purpose entity qspe 
ffc finances its acquisition of trade receivable assets by issuing beneficial interests in securitizing the receivables to multi seller receivables securitization companies the conduits for proceeds of up to million 
ffc and the conduits have no recourse to ferro s other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due as the assets transferred are legally isolated in accordance with the us bankruptcy laws 
ferro s consolidated balance sheet does not include the trade receivables sold  but does include a note receivable from ffc to the extent that cash proceeds from the sales of accounts receivable to ffc have not yet been received by ferro 
at december   ferro had received net proceeds of million for outstanding receivables  and the balance of ferro s note receivable from ffc was million 
in addition  we maintain several international programs to sell trade accounts receivable  primarily without recourse 
the commitments supporting this program can be withdrawn at any time and totaled million at december  the amount of outstanding receivables sold under the international programs was million at december  consignment and customer arrangements for precious metals 
in the production of some of our products  we use precious metals  primarily silver  platinum and palladium for electronic materials products and gold for color and glass performance materials products 
we obtain most precious metals from financial institutions under consignment agreements with terms of one year or less 
the financial institutions retain ownership of the precious metals and charge us fees based on the amounts we consign 
these fees were million for in november  the financial institutions renewed their requirement for cash deposits from us to provide additional collateral beyond the value of the underlying precious metals 
outstanding collateral deposits were million at december  these requirements were eliminated during the first six months of we also process precious metals owned by our customers 
at december   we had on hand million of precious metals owned by financial institutions  measured at fair value 
bank guarantees and standby letters of credit 
at december   the company had bank guarantees and standby letters of credit issued by financial institutions  which totaled million 
these agreements primarily relate to ferro s insurance programs and foreign tax payments 
other financing arrangement we maintain other lines of credit to provide global flexibility for ferro s short term liquidity requirements 
these facilities are uncommitted lines for our international operations and totaled million at december  the unused portions of these lines provided million of additional liquidity at december  liquidity requirement our liquidity requirements primarily include debt service  purchase commitments  working capital requirements  capital investments  postretirement obligations and dividend payments 
we expect to meet these requirements through cash provided by operating activities and availability under existing or replacement credit facilities 
ferro s level of debt and debt service requirements could have important consequences to its business operations and uses of cash flows 

table of contents the company s aggregate amount of obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below thereafter totals dollars in thousands loans payable to banks senior notes revolving credit facility term loan facility other long term notes obligations under capital leases obligations under operating leases purchase commitments cash required for interest costs in was million 
we expect that the amount for will not be substantially different  but the actual amount depends on interest rates on our variable rate debt and our overall debt levels 
we pay taxes as part of our normal operations as a profitable company 
the amount of taxes we pay depends on a variety of factors described in more detail in critical accounting policies below 
however  the principal factors are the level of our profitability and the countries in which we earn our taxable income 
we have paid and expect to continue to pay taxes for the foreseeable future 
under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin no 
 we anticipate that between and million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits may be settled or reversed within the next months 
these reversals or payments will result from settlements with foreign tax authorities or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid or reversed in years beyond we expect to contribute approximately million to our post employment benefit plans in over the four year period from through  we may be required to contribute an additional million to these plans 
we determined these funding amounts based on the minimum contributions required under various applicable regulations in each respective country 
actual contributions also depend on the future funded status of the plans and on the amount of employee contributions 
critical accounting policies and their application when we prepare our consolidated financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
we consider the policies discussed below to be more critical than other policies because their application requires our most subjective or complex judgments 
these estimates and judgments arise because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined utilizing the first in  first out fifo method 
on january   we elected to change our costing method for our inventories not already costed under the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method  while in prior years  these inventories were costed under the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out lifo method 
we believe the fifo method is preferable as it conforms the inventory costing methods for all of our inventories to a single method and improves comparability with our industry peers 
the fifo method also better reflects current acquisition cost of those inventories on our consolidated balance sheets and enhances the matching of future cost of sales with revenues 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error correction  
table of contents all prior periods presented have been adjusted to apply the new method retrospectively 
the effect of the change in our inventory costing method includes the lifo reserve and related impact on the obsolescence reserve 
this change increased our inventory balance by million and increased retained earnings  net of income tax effects  by million as of january  we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of inventories based primarily upon their age  but also upon assumptions of future usage in production  customer demand and market conditions 
inventories have been reduced to the lower of cost or realizable value by allowances for slow moving or obsolete goods 
if actual circumstances are less favorable than those projected by management in its evaluation of the net realizable value of inventories  additional write downs may be required 
slow moving  excess or obsolete materials are specifically identified and may be physically separated from other materials  and we rework or dispose of these materials as time and manpower permit 
we maintain raw material on our premises that we do not own  including precious metals consigned from financial institutions and customers  and raw materials consigned from vendors 
although we have physical possession of the goods  their value is not reflected on our balance sheet because we do not have title 
environmental liabilities our manufacturing facilities are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate 
the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future 
we expense these recurring costs as they are incurred 
while these costs may increase in the future  they are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
we also accrue for environmental remediation costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount 
we determine the timing and amount of any liability based upon assumptions regarding future events 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
we adjust these liabilities periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
because of these inherent uncertainties with respect to environmental remediation costs  potential liabilities could increase significantly from the million recorded as of december   due to adverse changes in circumstances 
at december   our consolidated balance sheet included an accrued liability for environmental remediation costs of million compared with million at december  of the million accrued liability at december   approximately was reserved for facilities outside of the us of the amounts accrued  million at december   and million at december   related to six superfund sites 
income taxes the breadth of our operations and complexity of income tax regulations require us to assess uncertainties and make judgments in estimating the ultimate amount of income taxes we will pay 
the final income taxes we pay are based upon many factors  including existing income tax laws and regulations  negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international income tax audits 
the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to our income tax assets and liabilities in the future 
deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and we adjust our deferred income tax assets and liabilities for changes in income tax rates and income tax laws when changes are enacted 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets 
the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income  our ability to carry back or carry forward net operating losses and credits to offset taxable income in a prior year  as well as successful implementation of various tax strategies to generate taxable income where net operating losses or credit carryforwards exist 
in evaluating our 
table of contents ability to realize the deferred income tax assets  we rely principally on forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences and the availability of tax planning strategies 
we earn a significant portion of our pre tax income outside the us many of these us tax jurisdictions have statutory income tax rates that are lower than that in the us because we carry a majority of our debt in the us  we also have significant cash needs in the us to service this debt 
as a result  it is necessary for us to perform significant tax and treasury planning and analysis to determine the best actions to achieve the goals of meeting our us cash needs  while also reducing our worldwide taxable income 
in this tax and treasury planning  we consider future taxable income in the us and non us jurisdictions  future cash needs in the non us  and the timing and amount of dividend repatriations 
our ability to balance future taxable income and cash flows between the us and foreign locations depends on various strategies  such as the charging of management fees for intercompany services  transfer pricing  intercompany royalties  intercompany sales of technologies and intellectual property  and choosing between allowable tax methods 
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor defined benefit plans in the us and many countries outside the us  and we also sponsor retiree medical benefits for a segment of our salaried and hourly work force within the us the us pension plans represent approximately of pension plan assets  of benefit obligations and of net periodic pension cost 
the measurement dates used to determine pension and other postretirement benefit measurements are september th for the us plans and december st for the plans outside the us the assumptions we use in actuarial calculations for these plans have a significant impact on benefit obligations and annual net periodic benefit costs 
we meet with our actuaries annually to discuss key economic assumptions used to develop these benefit obligations and net periodic costs 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
we determine the discount rate for the us pension and retiree medical plans based on a bond model 
using the pension plans projected cash flows  the bond model considers all possible bond portfolios that produce matching cash flows and selects the portfolio with the highest possible yield 
these portfolios are based on bonds with a quality rating of aa or better under either moody s or s p 
the discount rates for the non us plans are based on a yield curve method  using aa rated bonds applicable in respective capital markets 
the duration of each plan s liabilities is used to select the rate from the yield curve corresponding to the same duration 
we then round the resulting yields to the nearest basis points 
we calculate the expected return on assets at the beginning of the year for defined benefit plans as the weighted average of the expected return for the target allocation of the principal asset classes held by each of the plans 
our target asset allocation percentages are bonds and equity securities for us plans and bonds  equity securities  and other investments for non us plans 
in determining the expected returns  we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long term rates of return 
the resulting expected returns are then rounded to the nearest basis points 
the actual rate of return in was for us plans and for non us plans 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment allocation and performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
all other assumptions are reviewed periodically by our actuaries and us and may be adjusted based on current trends and expectations as well as past experience in the plans 

table of contents the following table provides the sensitivity of net annual periodic benefit costs for our pension plans  including a us nonqualified retirement plan  and the retiree medical plan to a basis point decrease in both the discount rate and asset return assumption basis point decrease basis point decrease in asset return in discount rate assumption dollars in thousands us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans total the following table provides the rates used in the assumptions and the changes between and change discount rate used to measure benefit cost us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans discount rate used to measure benefit obligations us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans expected return on plan assets us pension plans non us pension plans changes in the rates used in these assumptions reflect changes in the underlying bond and equity yields 
the amortization of net actuarial unrecognized gains or losses is a component of net periodic cost 
these gains or losses result from the difference between actual and assumed results and from changes in actuarial assumptions 
at december   our us and non us pension plans  including the nonqualified retirement plan  and our us retiree medical plan had unrecognized net losses of million 
we will recognize these unrecognized net losses in net periodic cost in future years  with an estimated million being recognized in our overall net periodic benefit cost for all defined benefit plans decreased million from to costs declined by million due to changes we made in to our largest defined benefit plan  which covers certain salaried and hourly employees in the united states 
the affected employees stopped accruing benefit service after march   and now receive benefits in the company s defined contribution plan that previously covered only us salaried employees hired after we also benefited by million from higher expected returns on plan assets primarily due to higher asset balances resulting from company contributions  actual returns  and currency effects in various restructuring activities resulted in net curtailment gains of million  which were nearly offset by special termination benefit costs of million 
in  we recorded net curtailment gains of million related to closing our niagara falls  new york  manufacturing facility and million related to european restructuring activities in italy and recorded a net curtailment loss of million related to freezing or eliminating benefits at several us plants 
we also recorded costs of million for special termination benefits from other european restructuring activities that will result in closing the company s rotterdam  netherlands  manufacturing facility by the end of the second quarter of our us plans use a september th measurement date 
fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no

will require us to change the measurement date to december st beginning with the fiscal year 
expense for the gap period from september th to december st will be recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as of january  
table of contents restructuring and cost reduction programs during and  we developed and initiated several restructuring programs across a number of our business segments with the objectives of leveraging our global scale  realigning and lowering our cost structure  and optimizing capacity utilization 
the programs are primarily associated with north america and europe 
management continues to evaluate our businesses  and therefore  there may be supplemental provisions for new plan initiatives as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded  as payments are made  or actions are completed 
significant restructuring programs are described below 
the majority of initiatives begun in and prior are substantially completed 
certain programs that were initiated in continued in in total  we recorded million  million and million of pre tax restructuring charges in  and  respectively 
all of the charges related to severance benefits for employees affected by plant closings or capacity reduction  as well as various personnel in administrative or shared service functions 
the and charges included both termination benefits and asset writedowns 
we estimated accruals for termination benefits based on various factors including length of service  contract provisions  local legal requirements  projected final service dates  and salary levels 
we also analyzed the carrying value of long lived assets and recorded estimated accelerated depreciation through the anticipated end of the useful life of the assets affected by the restructuring 
in all likelihood  this accelerated depreciation will result in reducing the net book value of those assets to zero at the date operations cease 
while we believe that changes to our estimates are unlikely  the accuracy of our estimates depends on the successful completion of numerous actions 
delays in moving continuing operations to other facilities or increased cash outlays will increase our restructuring costs to such an extent that it could have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
other events  for example  a delay in completion of construction of new facilities  may also delay the resulting cost savings 
for the european restructurings initiated in  we established a goal of million to million in annual cost savings by the end of  with the full benefits realized in the initial phase of restructuring efforts began in july and targeted our performance coatings and color and glass performance materials segments in our european operations with an annual cost savings goal of million 
this restructuring should result in significant manufacturing efficiencies and will contribute to increased production capacity to support our revenue growth 
the current action consists of a consolidation of our cassiglie  italy  manufacturing operations and administrative functions into spain 
in addition  we announced a plan to consolidate certain decoration and color manufacturing operations from frankfurt  germany  to colditz  germany  with an annual cost savings goal of million 
we are in consultation with various works councils regarding the effects of these restructuring programs 
we estimate the total termination benefits for the employees affected by the european restructuring to be approximately million to million 
we recorded million and million of termination benefits related to these actions during and  and we expect to record an additional million to million in we also recorded million of impairment charges for equipment made obsolete due to this plan 

table of contents a second restructuring program initiated in involved our electronic materials segment and resulted in the sale of our manufacturing facilities in niagara falls  new york  in december this action is expected to result in annual cost reduction of approximately million 
as part of the restructuring activities  we redistributed a portion of the production at that facility to other existing electronic materials manufacturing facilities and reduced our workforce by employees 
of the employees who were terminated  were represented by a union  and we negotiated with the union to determine their termination benefits as the result of the closing 
we believe that the total estimated restructuring costs will be approximately million 
in the table below  we have summarized the charges recorded during and and the estimated future charges to be incurred related to this action estimated for dollars in thousands asset impairments fixed assets intellectual property termination benefits other total in september  we announced an additional phase of our european manufacturing restructuring with an annual cost savings of million 
this phase will include the closure of the rotterdam  netherlands  facility as part of our program to discontinue the porcelain enamel frit manufacturing at this site and consolidate production in other european facilities 
we anticipate rotterdam to cease production in the third quarter of and reduce the workforce by employees 
total restructuring charges for this site of million are anticipated  in addition to million of inventory write downs 
in  we recorded million of these charges for employee severance costs  pension expense for accelerated benefits and asset impairments  future minimum lease obligations and other costs 
we anticipate restructuring charges of approximately million for employee severance costs and million of future minimum lease obligations will be accrued by year end revenue recognition we recognize sales typically when we ship goods to our customers and when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and title and risk of loss has passed to our customers 
because we sell our many products throughout the world  we use varying sales and payment terms as agreed to with our customers 
in the us  our standard payment terms vary by industry and business unit  but are generally to days 
substantial amounts of our consolidated revenues are derived from foreign countries and in many of those countries the standard payment terms are longer than those prevalent in the us in order to ensure the revenue recognition in the proper period  we review material sales contracts for proper cut off based upon the business practices and legal requirements of each country 
for sales of products containing precious metals  we report gross revenues with a separate display of cost of sales to arrive at gross profit 
we record revenues this way because we act as the principal in the transactions we enter into and take title and the risks and rewards of ownership of the inventory we process  although the timing of when we take title to the inventory during the production process may vary 
the amount of shipping and handling fees invoiced to our customers at the time our product is shipped is included in net sales 
shipping and handling fees included in net sales were million in and million in credit memos issued to customers for sales returns  discounts allowed and sales adjustments are recorded when they are incurred as a reduction of sales 
we use estimated allowances to provide for future sales returns and 
table of contents adjustments in order to record revenues in the proper accounting period and to state the related accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
we estimate these allowances based upon historical sales return and adjustment rates 
actual allowances may be more or less than the amount we estimate 
in the past  these differences have not been material and we do not expect any material differences in the future 
additionally  we provide certain of our customers with incentive rebate programs to promote customer loyalty and encourage greater product sales 
we accrue customer rebates over the rebate periods based upon estimated attainments of the provisions in the rebate agreements using available information and record these rebate accruals as reductions of sales 
we incurred million of customer rebates in and million in we do not expect customer rebates to increase significantly in future periods 
valuation of goodwill while goodwill is no longer amortized  we review goodwill for impairment each year on a measurement date of october st 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill using the weighted average of both the income approach and the market approach  which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of the reporting unit s fair value 
the income approach is a discounted cash flow model  which uses projected cash flows attributable to the reporting unit  including an allocation of certain corporate expenses 
we use historical results and trends and our projections of market growth  internal sales efforts  input cost movements  and cost reduction opportunities to estimate future cash flows 
using a risk adjusted  weighted average cost of capital  we discount the cash flow projections to the measurement date 
the market approach estimates a price reasonably expected to be realized from the sale of the reporting units based on a comparison to similar businesses 
if the fair value of any of the units were determined to be less than its carrying value  including the allocation of certain corporate assets and liabilities  we would proceed to the second step and obtain comparable market values or independent appraisals of its net assets to determine the amount of any impairment 
our estimates of fair value can be affected by a variety of factors 
reductions in actual or projected growth or profitability due to unfavorable market conditions in our business units  or significant increases in previous levels of capital spending  could lead to the impairment of any related goodwill 
additionally  an increase in inflation  interest rates or the risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital could also lead to a reduction in the value of one or more of our business units and therefore lead to the impairment of goodwill 
due to the cumulative negative effect on earnings of a cyclical downturn in certain of the primary us based end markets  including housing and automobile parts  of our polymer additives business  anticipated additional product costs resulting from recent hazardous material legislation and regulations  such as the newly enacted european union reach registration system  which requires chemical suppliers to perform toxicity studies of the components of their products and to register certain information  and higher forecasted capital expenditures for this business  we were required to record an impairment of the goodwill related to our polymer additives business 
additionally  in our pharmaceutical business  primarily due to the result of a longer time to transition the business from a supplier of food supplements and additives to a supplier of high value pharmaceutical products and services  we recorded an impairment of goodwill 
in and  the fair value exceeded the carrying value  and therefore  it was not necessary to obtain independent appraisals 
assessment of long lived assets our long lived assets also include property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we continually assess these long lived assets for the appropriateness of their estimated useful lives 
when circumstances indicate that there has been a reduction in the economic useful life of an asset or an asset group  we revise our estimates 
in and  we shortened our estimates of the useful lives for several asset groups due to our restructuring activities 
we also review property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangibles for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use and eventual disposition are less than the assets recorded value 
in the event of impairment  we recognize a loss for the excess of the recorded value of the asset over its fair value 
the long term nature of these assets requires that we estimate cash inflows and 
table of contents outflows for several years into the future and only take into consideration technological advances known at the time of impairment 
in  the circumstances described above  relating to the impairment of goodwill in the polymer additives segment and in the pharmaceutical products component of our other businesses segment  also resulted in the recognition of an impairment of the property plant and equipment in both segments 
the fair values determined during the review of goodwill were used to measure the amount of impairment on the fixed assets 
we recorded as impairment charges million in the polymer additives segment and million in the other businesses segment 
due to depressed conditions in the electronics industry in  we specifically evaluated our electronics assets in holland 
also in  we evaluated our italian tile and belgian polymer additives manufacturing assets because of sluggish market conditions in these regions 
in each situation  we concluded that the assets were not impaired 
in and  we recorded impairment charges for both property  plant and equipment and intangible assets due to restructuring activities 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and precious metal prices 
the accounting for derivative financial instruments can be complex and require significant judgments 
generally  the derivative financial instruments that we use are not complex and quoted market prices are available through financial institutions 
we do not engage in speculative transactions for trading purposes 
financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments  expose us to counterparty credit risk for non performance 
we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through minimum credit standards and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we enter into these derivative financial instruments with major reputable multinational financial institutions 
accordingly  we do not anticipate counter party default 
we continuously evaluate the effectiveness of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges to ensure that they are highly effective 
in the event the hedge becomes ineffective  we discontinue hedge treatment 
our exposure to interest rate changes arises from our debt agreements with variable market interest rates 
we hedge a portion of this exposure by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
we mark these swaps to fair value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other comprehensive income 
these swaps are settled quarterly in cash  and the net interest paid or received is effectively recognized as interest expense 
at december   million of losses remained in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we manage foreign currency risks in a wide variety of foreign currencies principally by entering into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions arising from international trade 
our objective in entering into these forward contracts is to preserve the economic value of non functional currency cash flows 
our principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling  the japanese yen  and the chinese yuan 
we mark these forward contracts to fair value at the end of each reporting period and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other income or expense from foreign currency transactions 
we recorded mark to market gains from forward currency contracts of million in and mark to market losses of million in the amounts of gains or losses we record depend on a variety of factors including the notional amount of the forward contracts entered into and the fluctuation of the underlying currency exchange rates 
we do not expect any change in our foreign currency risk policies or in the nature of the transactions we enter into to mitigate foreign currency risk 
our exposure to market risk from commodity prices relate primarily to commodity raw materials and energy used in the production of a portion of our products 
we purchase portions of our energy requirements  including natural gas and electricity  under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of cost changes 
for contracts entered into prior to april  we marked these contracts to fair value and recognized the resulting gains or losses as miscellaneous income or expense  respectively 
we recognized mark to market gains of million in and mark to market losses of million in beginning april  we designated new energy contracts as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market 
due to the designation of these contracts as normal purchase contracts  we do not expect to recognize mark to market gains or losses in future periods 
our purchase 
table of contents commitments for energy under normal purchase contracts at december   were million for million mbtu of natural gas and million for million kwh of electricity 
we also manage a portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in the pricing of certain raw material commodities using derivative instruments 
we hedge our exposure principally through swap arrangements that allow us to fix the price of the commodities for future purchases 
these swap arrangements are settled in cash at their maturities 
we mark these contracts to fair value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other comprehensive income 
after the contracts mature and the materials are sold  the gains and losses are recognized as a part of cost of sales 
we recognized net gains of million in and million in in cost of sales related to these swaps 
at december   million of losses remained in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and inventories 
we do not expect any change in our commodity risk policies or in the nature of the transactions we enter into to mitigate commodity market risk 
precious metals primarily silver  gold  platinum and palladium represent a significant portion of raw material costs in our electronic materials and our color and glass performance materials products 
sometimes when an order for these products is placed  the customer requests a fixed price for the precious metals content 
in these instances  we enter into a fixed price sales contract to establish the cost for the customer at the estimated future delivery date 
at the same time  we enter into a forward purchase arrangement with a precious metals supplier to completely cover the value of the fixed price sales contract 
us precious metal contracts entered into prior to november and all non us precious metal contracts are marked to fair value at the end of each reporting period  and the resulting gains or losses are recognized as miscellaneous income or expense  respectively 
we recognized million of net gains in and million of net losses in beginning november  we designated new us precious metal contracts as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market 
our purchase commitment for precious metals under normal purchase contracts at december   was million for million troy ounces

in  we will retrospectively reclassify the amount of minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries to equity and separately report the amount of net income or loss attributable to minority interests 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risks is generally limited to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and costs of raw materials and energy 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises from our debt portfolio 
we manage this risk by controlling the mix of fixed versus variable rate debt after considering the interest rate environment and expected future cash flows 
to reduce our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  we entered into interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
our overall objective is to limit variability in earnings  cash flows and overall borrowing costs caused by changes in interest rates  while preserving operating flexibility 
we operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these transactions expose us to gains and losses arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled 
we manage this risk by entering into forward currency contracts that offset these gains and losses  and hedge our currency exposure 
we are subject to cost changes with respect to our raw materials and energy purchases 
we attempt to mitigate raw materials cost increases through product reformulations  price increases  and other productivity improvements 
we hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in the pricing of certain raw material commodities through swap arrangements that allow us to fix the pricing of the commodities for future purchases from our suppliers 
when we enter into fixed price sales contracts for products with precious metal content  we also enter into a forward purchase arrangement with a precious metals supplier to cover the value of the fixed price sales contract 
us precious metal contracts entered into prior to november and all non us precious metal contracts are marked to fair value at the end of each reporting period  and the resulting gains or losses are recognized as miscellaneous income or expense  respectively 
beginning in november  we designated new us precious metal contracts as normal purchases which are not marked to market 
our purchase commitment for precious metals under normal purchase contracts at december   was million for million troy ounces 
in addition  we purchase portions of our natural gas and electricity requirements under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of these costs 
for energy contracts entered into prior to april  we marked these contracts to fair value and recognized the resulting gains or losses as miscellaneous income or expense  respectively 
beginning april  we designated new energy contracts as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market 
our purchase commitments for energy under normal purchase contracts at december   were million for million mbtu of natural gas and million for million kwh of electricity
