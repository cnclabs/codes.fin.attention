we completed our acquisition of investors financial in july  and issued approximately million shares in the transaction 
for the second half of the year  the acquired investors financial business contributed million in revenue  including million in fee revenue  and million in operating expenses 
in connection with the acquisition  during the second half of the year we recorded million  or million after tax  of merger and integration costs 
during the second half of  we purchased million shares of our common stock  as well as an additional 
million shares in january  under a billion accelerated share repurchase program  which program concluded on january  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a net pre tax charge of million  or million after tax  to establish a reserve associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by ssga 
certain financial information is presented and discussed in the following sections on both a gaap basis and on an operating basis 
management measures certain financial information on an operating basis to provide for meaningful comparisons from period to period  and to present comparable financial trends with respect to our normal ongoing business operations 
management believes that operating basis financial information  which includes the impact of revenue from non taxable sources and excludes the impact of non recurring expenses  facilitates an investor s understanding and analysis of state street s underlying performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
financial highlights for  we recorded income from continuing operations of billion  or per diluted share  compared to billion  or per diluted share  for total revenue increased from  and return on equity from continuing operations was compared to for results for included two significant expenses

total revenue for grew from total fee revenue for  which grew  reflected consistent growth throughout the year in servicing fees and management fees  up and  respectively  compared to  and trading services and securities finance revenue  up and  respectively 
generally  servicing fees benefited from the inclusion of the acquired investors financial business  net new business and favorable equity markets  and management fees benefited primarily from net new business and favorable equity markets 
trading services revenue grew primarily as a result of increases in customer volumes and the inclusion of the acquired investors financial business  with respect to foreign exchange revenue  and as a result of the inclusion of revenue from the acquired currenex business  with respect to other trading services revenue 
securities finance revenue benefited from increases in volumes of securities loaned  both from new customers and from growth in volume from existing customers  and increases in spreads 
net interest revenue increased compared to  and net interest margin increased to from 
this growth was the result of several favorable trends favorable rates and volumes on non us deposits  the addition of interest earning assets from investors financial s balance sheet  and the favorable impact of fixed rate investments 
total operating expenses increased from  partly reflective of the million aggregate impact of merger and integration costs associated with investors financial and a net pre tax charge associated with certain ssga active fixed income strategies 
if these aggregate costs are excluded  total operating expenses for totaled billion billion less million  an increase of from billion for  as we continued to carefully manage operating expenses and balance growth in operating expenses with growth in revenue 
most of the increase resulted from the inclusion of the operating expenses of the acquired investors financial business for the second half of  as well as increased incentive compensation due to improved performance and increased staffing levels to support new business  particularly internationally 
excluding the aggregate million of merger and integration costs and the net pre tax charge  as a result of year over year growth in revenue of and year over year growth in total operating expenses of as described above  we generated positive operating leverage of approximately basis points 
we define positive operating leverage as a rate of total revenue growth that exceeds the rate of growth of total operating expenses  determined on an operating basis 
ssga was a significant contributor to our overall results for its total revenue increased for over  and comprised about of our total consolidated revenue for  compared to for in addition  ssga generated net new business in assets under management  which we expect will generate management fee revenue in future years  of approximately billion for  compared to billion for the decline in ssga s relative contribution to our consolidated total revenue was the result of the impact of the acquired investors financial business s revenue on total revenue of our investment servicing line of business  which increased for over we continue to expand our business outside of the us  particularly in europe and the asia pacific region 
for  approximately billion  or of our consolidated total revenue of billion  was generated from non us activities  compared to for the percentage reflects revenue from the acquired investors financial business  which was predominantly generated in the us for illustrative purposes  if we exclude total revenue from the acquired investors financial business for of million  non us revenue of billion for comprised approximately of consolidated total revenue for of billion billion less million 
at year end  we employed  outside the us  compared to  at year end our goal is to eventually generate of our consolidated total revenue from outside the united states 
assets under custody and assets under management both increased from year end  with assets under custody at trillion  up from trillion a year ago  and assets under management at trillion  up from trillion a year ago 
the acquired investors financial business contributed trillion of assets under custody 
assets under custody have grown at a compound annual rate of since year end  with us assets growing by and us assets growing by  while assets under management have grown at a compound annual rate of over the same period

we are consistently gaining business globally  and for  our non us revenue was approximately of our total revenue  compared to for and for we provide a broad range of reliable  easy to integrate investment services that are global and enable our customers to develop and launch competitive new investment products

we provide fund accounting  custody  investment management  securities finance  transfer agency services  and operations outsourcing for investment managers and hedge fund managers 
these services support the complex financial strategies and transactions of our customers worldwide  in any time zone across multiple currencies 
our focus on the total needs of the customer allows us to develop active  long term relationships that result in high customer retention  cross selling opportunities  and recurring revenue 
the servicing markets in which we compete are very price competitive  and we consistently focus on winning and retaining customer business 
this focus requires a strong commitment to customers while constantly working toward providing services at lower costs 
our broad range of services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue 
fee revenue generated by investment servicing and investment management is augmented by securities finance  trading services and other processing fee revenue 
we earn net interest revenue from customers deposits and short term investment activities  by providing deposit services and short term investment vehicles  such as repurchase agreements and commercial paper  to meet customers needs for high grade liquid investments  and investing these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate 
fee revenue servicing and management fees are the largest components of fee revenue  and collectively comprised approximately of total fee revenue for and for these fees are a function of several factors  including the mix and volume of assets under custody and assets under management  securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions  and the types of products and services used by customers  and are affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income valuations 
generally  servicing fees are impacted  in part  by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody  while management fees are impacted by changes in month end valuations of assets under management 
additional factors  such as the level of transaction volumes  changes in service level  balance credits  customer minimum balances  pricing concessions and other factors may have a significant impact on servicing fee revenue 
generally  management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue 
management fees also include performance fees  which amounted to approximately of management fees for compared to for performance fees are generated when the performance of managed funds exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements  and we experience more volatility with performance fees than with more traditional management fees 
in light of the above  we estimate  assuming all other factors remain constant  that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 
if fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by  we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately in our total revenue 
the following table presents selected equity market indices 
daily averages and the averages of month end indices demonstrate worldwide equity market valuation changes that impact servicing and management fee revenue  respectively 
year end indices impact the value of assets under custody and management at those dates

products and services include custody  product and participant level accounting  daily pricing and administration  recordkeeping  investment manager and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing services  master trust and master custody  and performance  risk and compliance analytics 
the increase in servicing fees of million from primarily resulted from the inclusion of million of servicing fee revenue from the acquired investors financial business  net new business from existing and new customers  higher average equity market valuations and higher customer transaction volumes 
net new business is defined as new business net of lost business 
for  servicing fees generated from customers outside the us were approximately of total servicing fees  down from in the decrease in the non us proportion reflected the contribution of servicing fees from the acquired investors financial business  which are generated predominantly in the us we are the largest provider of mutual fund custody and accounting services in the united states 
we distinguish ourselves from other mutual fund service providers by offering customers a broad array of integrated products and services  including accounting  daily pricing and fund administration

in the united kingdom  we provide custody services for of pension fund assets and provide administration services to more than of mutual fund assets 
we service approximately of the hedge fund market and more than billion of offshore assets  primarily domiciled in ireland and luxembourg 
we have more than trillion in assets under administration in the asia pacific region  and are the largest non domestic trust bank in japan 
at year end  our total assets under custody were trillion  compared to trillion a year earlier 
the value of assets under custody is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served 
changes in the value of assets under custody do not necessarily result in proportional changes in revenue 
assets under custody consisted of the following at december assets under custody as of december  agr cagr dollars in billions mutual funds      collective funds     pension products      insurance and other products     total      financial instrument mix of assets under custody as of december  in billions equities    fixed income    short term and other investments    total    geographic mix of assets under custody as of december  in billions united states    other americas europe middle east africa    asia pacific total    geographic mix is based on the location where the assets are serviced 
management fees we provide a broad range of investment management strategies  specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations  public funds  and other sophisticated investors 
these services are offered through ssga 
based upon assets under management  ssga is the largest manager of institutional assets worldwide  the largest manager of assets for tax exempt organizations primarily pension plans in the united states  and the third largest investment manager overall in the world 
ssga offers a broad array of investment management strategies  including passive and active  such as enhanced indexing and hedge fund strategies  using quantitative and fundamental methods for both us and global equities and fixed income securities 
ssga also offers exchange traded funds  or etfs  such as the spdr dividend etfs 
the million increase in management fees from primarily resulted from net new business and higher equity market valuations 
performance fees decreased from million in to million in management fees generated from customers outside the united states were approximately of total management fees  up from for at year end  assets under management were trillion  compared to trillion at year end while certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed  management fees reflect other factors as well  including our relationship pricing for customers who use multiple services  and the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees 
accordingly  no direct correlation necessarily exists between the value of assets under management  market indices and management fee revenue 
assets under management consisted of the following at december assets under management as of december  agr cagr dollars in billions equities passive active and other company stock esop total equities  fixed income passive active cash and money market total fixed income and cash total      geographic mix of assets under management as of december  in billions united states    other americas europe middle east africa asia pacific total    geographic mix is based on the location where the assets are managed 
the following table presents a roll forward of assets under management for the three years ended december  assets under management years ended december  in billions balance at beginning of year    net new business market appreciation balance at end of year    trading services trading services revenue includes revenue from foreign exchange trading and brokerage and other trading services 
we offer a complete range of foreign exchange services under an account model that focuses on the global requirements of our customers to execute trades and receive market insights in any time zone 
in march  we acquired currenex s electronic foreign exchange trading platform 
the currenex business serves hedge funds  banks and other commercial enterprises in the active trading segment of the foreign exchange market 
we have exclusive ownership of fx connect  the world s first foreign exchange trading platform  and we provide quantitatively based research into investor behavior  as well as consultative services that use quantitative tools designed to optimize our customers returns 
foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors the volume and type of customer foreign exchange transactions  currency volatility  and the management of currency market risks 
for  foreign exchange trading revenue increased  to million from million in  and benefited from the disruption in the global securities markets that occurred in the second half of the year 
the increase was mainly driven by a increase in customer volumes  but also was the result of the inclusion of million of foreign exchange revenue from the acquired investors financial business 
these increases were partly offset by an unfavorable transaction mix influenced by lower margin transactions and a decline in currency volatility 
we also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community  including transition management  commission recapture and self directed brokerage 
these products are differentiated by our position as an agent of the institutional investor 
brokerage and other trading fees were million in  up compared to the increase was attributable to the contribution of revenue from the acquired currenex business and an increase in revenue from transition management 
securities finance securities finance provides liquidity to the financial markets and an effective means for customers to earn revenue on their existing portfolios 
by acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers  we lend securities and provide liquidity to customers around the world 
borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to state street in return for loaned securities 
for cash collateral  we pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral  and invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles 
the spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and state street as agent 
for non cash collateral  the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities  and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and state street 
securities finance revenue is principally a function of the volume of securities loaned and the interest rate spreads earned on the collateral 
for  securities finance revenue increased from a year earlier  as loan volumes increased  with this volume resulting from both new customer demand and increased demand from existing customers 
consolidated spread also increased  primarily in the domestic and non us equity portfolios and the corporate bond and fixed income portfolios 
spreads benefited from reductions in federal funds rates during  as well as from the above mentioned market disruption 
processing fees and other processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and other revenue  including fees from our structured products business  fees from software licensing and maintenance  profits and losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries  gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets  and amortization of investments in tax advantaged financings 
processing fees and other revenue decreased from  with an additional million of revenue from the acquired investors financial business and improved joint venture performance more than offset by reduced revenue from the structured products business  primarily from the asset backed commercial paper program  and the absence of revenue from our tax exempt investment program 
the absence of revenue from the tax exempt investment program resulted from the impact of the consolidation of the program onto our balance sheet on september  as a result of this consolidation  revenue from the program  previously recorded in processing fees and other  is now recorded in net interest revenue 
net interest revenue years ended december  average balance interest revenue expense rate average balance interest revenue expense rate average balance interest revenue expense rate dollars in millions  fully taxable equivalent basis federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements investment securities     loans and leases   other    total interest earning assets    deposits     short term borrowings    long term debt   total interest bearing liabilities   interest rate spread

interest earning assets  which consist of investment securities  loans and leases and money market assets  are financed primarily by customer deposits and short term borrowings 
additional detail about the components of interest revenue and interest expense is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest revenue increased on a gaap basis compared to  and net interest margin increased to from 
this growth was the result of several favorable trends 
first  transaction deposit volume  particularly with respect to non us deposits  increased  and spread increased 
volume increases resulted from net new business in non us assets under custody  as we continue to grow our servicing business internationally  and spreads increased because deposit rates lagged rate increases by foreign central banks during and second  the acquired investors financial business added interest earning assets and related net interest revenue 
third  as fixed rate investment securities matured  they were replaced by higher yielding investments 
net interest margin represents the relationship between net interest revenue and average interest earning assets 
changes in the components of interest earning assets  as well as interest bearing liabilities  are discussed in more detail below 
average federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements increased or billion  from billion in to billion for the increase was primarily the result of excess liquidity 
our average investment securities portfolio increased from approximately billion to approximately billion  primarily due to the acquisition of investment securities of investors financial and increases in our tax exempt securities portfolio 
the investment portfolio now includes a higher percentage of collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage and asset backed securities compared to a year earlier 
these increases did not adversely affect overall risk  as we continued to invest conservatively in aa and aaa rated securities 
securities rated aa and aaa comprised approximately of the investment securities portfolio  with approximately aaa rated  at december  loans and leases averaged billion  up from billion in the increase was related to higher levels of customer overdraft activity 
approximately of the loans and leases portfolio is composed of us and us short duration advances  primarily related to the processing of custodied customer investments  which averaged approximately billion for  up from billion in the billion increase in average interest bearing deposits from was mainly due to the acquisition of investors financial and an increase in low cost customer deposits  primarily non us deposits 
this deposit growth funded the billion increase in average interest earning assets 
average short term borrowings decreased primarily due to the liquidity provided by the increase in customer deposits  and long term debt increased due to debt issuances associated with the investors financial acquisition 
several factors could affect future levels of net interest revenue and margin  including the federal reserve s ongoing actions to manage short term interest rates  the level and pace of changes in non us interest rates  particularly as a result of actions of the european central bank and the bank of england  the mix of customer liabilities  and the shapes of the various yield curves around the world 
gains losses on sales of available for sale securities  net our management of the investment securities portfolio has many objectives  the foremost of which are to provide liquidity and to serve as a source of collateral for customer activities 
these objectives may entail strategic sales of specific securities as market conditions warrant 
we recorded net gains of million on sales of available for sale securities for  compared to net gains of million for at december   approximately of the investment securities portfolio  or billion  was classified as available for sale 
additional information about available for sale securities  and the gross gains and losses that comprise the net gains  is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item operating expenses years ended december  change dollars in millions salaries and employee benefits    information systems and communications transaction processing services occupancy provision for legal exposure merger and integration costs other total operating expenses    number of employees at year end    the increase in salaries and employee benefits from was driven primarily by the inclusion of approximately million of salaries and benefits expense of the acquired investors financial business and salaries and benefits expense of the acquired currenex business  higher incentive compensation costs due to improved performance which were offset by the reduction of incentive compensation recorded as part of the net pre tax charge related to ssga discussed later in this section  and the impact of higher staffing levels 
staffing levels increased to support growth in our investment servicing business  particularly in europe  and in our investment management business  as well as in information technology and risk management 
the increase in information systems and communications expense included approximately million from the acquired investors financial business  as well as increased spending internationally to support growth 
transaction processing services expenses are volume related  and include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement  sub custodian fees and external contract services 
the increase included approximately million from the acquired investors financial business  specifically sub custody costs  higher transaction volumes  and external contract services  primarily in europe 
occupancy expense was up from  primarily due to additional leased space acquired as part of the investors financial acquisition  as well as higher occupancy costs in support of growth in europe 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a net pre tax charge of million in connection with the establishment of a reserve to address litigation exposure and other costs associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by ssga and customer concerns as to whether the execution of these strategies was consistent with customers investment intent 
the net charge had the following components a provision for legal exposure of million offset by million of insurance coverage  a million reduction of salaries and benefits expense related to reduced incentive compensation primarily associated with ssga  offset by million of severance costs  and million of other expenses related to professional fees 
more information about this litigation exposure is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item during the second half of  in connection with the investors financial acquisition  we recorded merger and integration costs of million 
these costs consisted only of direct and incremental costs to integrate the acquired investors financial business into our operations  and did not include on going expenses of the combined organization 
the costs included a non cash charge of approximately million resulting from the termination of an operating lease related to one of our office buildings in boston 
this termination was completed in connection with an overall evaluation of our requirements for office space as a result of the acquisition 
the merger and integration costs also included million associated with employee retention and other compensation  and million associated with the integration of the acquired investors financial business s accounting and management systems 
in addition  subsequent to the completion of the acquisition  we redeemed an aggregate of million of unsecured junior subordinated debentures issued by the parent company to two of our statutory business trusts  composed of million of debentures issued in and million of debentures issued in we paid the trusts the outstanding amount on the debentures plus accrued interest and an aggregate redemption premium of approximately million  which was included in the merger and integration costs 
the increase in other expenses from primarily resulted from the acquired investors financial business  increases in professional services  securities processing costs  higher sales promotion costs and increased amortization of intangibles that resulted from the acquisitions of investors financial and currenex 
income taxes income tax expense totaled million for  compared to million from continuing operations a year ago 
the decrease was primarily the result of the absence of the impact of federal tax legislation that increased income tax expense for the overall effective tax rate for was  compared to for additional information about income tax expense is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item the income tax expense from discontinued operations of million was related to million of income associated with the finalization of certain costs recorded in connection with our divestiture of bel air  which was completed during information about income tax contingencies related to our leveraged lease portfolio is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item line of business information we report two lines of business investment servicing and investment management

the net charge had the following components a provision for legal exposure of million offset by million of insurance coverage  a million reduction of salaries and benefits expense related to reduced incentive compensation offset by million of severance costs  and million of other expenses related to professional fees 
more information about this charge is included in the consolidated results of operations operating expenses section of this management s discussion and analysis 
the pre tax margin for investment management  which is the percentage of the business line s pre tax income to its total revenue  was for compared to for and for the significant decrease in margin was the result of the net charge described above 
without the net charge  investment management s pre tax income would have been million million plus million  and its pre tax margin would have been for during the second half of  the global markets for fixed income securities  particularly the markets for financial instruments collateralized by sub prime mortgages  experienced significant disruption 
this disruption affected the liquidity and pricing of securities traded in these markets  as well as the returns of  and levels of redemptions in  investment vehicles investing in those instruments

as of december   global fixed income assets under management totaled approximately billion  an increase of approximately billion compared to billion at december   with approximately billion under active management 
this amount included approximately billion of ssga customer assets which were invested in strategies that were adversely affected by a combination of holdings in financial instruments collateralized by sub prime mortgages  illiquidity in the fixed income markets generally  and customer redemptions 
these strategies included approximately billion of institutional customer investments in non registered pooled investment funds  approximately billion of unit investments by other ssga investment funds in the same non registered pooled investment funds  approximately billion of institutional customer investments in separately managed customer accounts  and approximately billion of customer investments in mutual funds

our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item the majority of these accounting policies do not involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application  or the variability of the estimates is not material to the consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of these accounting policies  by their nature  require management to make judgments  involving significant estimates and assumptions  about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  and changes in this information over time could materially impact amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported in subsequent financial statements 
based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying policies  estimates and assumptions  the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by state street have been identified by management as accounting for fair value of financial instruments  accounting for special purpose entities  accounting for goodwill  and accounting for income taxes 
these policies require the most subjective or complex judgments  and related estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
an understanding of the judgments  estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting policies 
management of state street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the examining and audit committee of our board of directors 
fair value of financial instruments we carry certain of our assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements  including trading assets  investment securities available for sale and derivative instruments 
at december   approximately billion of our assets and approximately billion of our liabilities were carried at fair value 
the fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an arm s length transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices and observable market inputs 
for a significant amount of our assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value  those fair values are determined based upon quotations provided by independent third party pricing services or observable market inputs  and as a result there is little or no management judgment involved in determining fair value 
prices provided by independent third party pricing services are subject to review by management 
in developing their quotations  the independent pricing services seek to utilize observable inputs  including trade and market information 
however  because many fixed income securities do not trade regularly  the pricing services quotations may also be based on proprietary financial models that incorporate available information  such as benchmarking to similar securities  sector groupings or matrix pricing 
quotations may not always be available for some securities or in markets where trading activity has slowed or ceased 
when quotations are not available  and are not provided by third party pricing services  management judgment is necessary to determine fair value 
in situations involving management judgment  fair value is determined using discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models  which incorporate available market information  including appropriate benchmarking to similar instruments  analysis of default and recovery rates  estimation of prepayment characteristics and implied volatilities 
discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon estimated future cash flows and the level of interest rates 
expected cash flows are discounted using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment 
valuation models use as their basis independently sourced market inputs including  for example  interest rate yield curves and foreign currency exchange rates 
our valuation process using models considers factors such as credit quality  product structure  third party enhancements and guarantees 
we apply judgment in the application of these factors 
other factors can affect our estimates of fair value  including market dislocations  incorrect model assumptions and unexpected correlations 
these valuation methods could expose us to materially different results should the models used or underlying assumptions be inaccurate 
we determine fair value for trading account assets primarily by using quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments in active markets for those securities 
fair value for investment securities available for sale is determined using quotations from independent third party pricing services  which generally are based on observable market inputs for identical or similar instruments in active and non active markets for those securities 
we value derivative instruments primarily by using valuation models 
these models generally do not involve material subjectivity because the methodologies used do not necessitate significant judgment  and the pricing inputs are observed from actively quoted markets  for instance with over the counter interest rate swap and option contracts  and foreign exchange forward and option contracts 
management reviews the fair value of the portfolio at least quarterly  and evaluates individual securities for declines in fair value that may be other than temporary 
this review considers factors such as current and expected future interest rates  external credit ratings  dividend payments  the financial health of the issuer and other pertinent information 
other pertinent information includes current developments with respect to the issuer  the length of time the cost basis has exceeded the fair value  the severity of the impairment measured as the ratio of fair value to amortized cost and management s intent and ability to hold the security 
the review includes all investment securities for which we have issuer specific concerns regardless of quantitative factors 
the review considers current economic conditions  adverse situations that might affect our ability to fully collect interest and principal  the timing of future payments  the credit quality and performance of underlying collateral and guarantees and other relevant factors 
if declines are deemed other than temporary  an impairment loss is recognized and the amortized cost basis of the investment security is written down to its current fair value  which becomes the new cost basis 
additional information about fair values of financial instruments and fair value estimates is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
special purpose entities in the normal course of business  we utilize three types of special purpose entities  referred to as spes  two of which are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
information about the activities of these spes  which are used in connection with our tax exempt investment program  our involvement with managed investment vehicles and our asset backed commercial paper program  is in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item additional information about spes used in connection with our commercial paper program is provided below 
in our role as a financial intermediary  we administer four third party asset backed commercial paper conduits  which are structured as bankruptcy remote  limited liability companies  and which are not included in our consolidated financial statements 
these conduits purchase a variety of financial assets from third party financial institutions  and fund these purchases by issuing commercial paper 
the financial assets purchased by the conduits are not originated by us  and we do not hold any equity ownership interest in the conduits 
additional information about the conduits and their business activities is in the off balance sheet arrangements section of this management s discussion and analysis and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
our accounting for the conduits activities  and our conclusion that we are not required to include each or all of the conduits assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  is based on our application of the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
r  which governs our accounting for the conduits and which is discussed in more detail in note expected losses  which we estimate using a financial model as described below  form the basis for our application of the provisions of fin r 
expected losses  as defined by fin r  are not economic losses 
instead  expected losses are calculated by comparing projected possible cash flows  which are probability weighted  with expected cash flows for the risk s the entity was designed to create and distribute  they represent the variability in potential cash flows of the entity s designated risks 
we believe that credit risk is the predominant risk that is designed to be created and distributed by these entities 
there is also a modest amount of basis risk within each conduit 
basis risk arises when commercial paper funding costs move at a different rate than the comparable floating rate asset benchmark rates generally libor 
this risk is mitigated through the use of derivative instruments  principally basis swaps  which remove this variability from each conduit 
accordingly  basis risk is not a significant assumption in the financial model 
any credit losses of the conduits would be absorbed by investors in the subordinated debt  commonly referred to as first loss notes  issued by the conduits  state street  and the holders of the conduits commercial paper  in order of priority 
the investors in the first loss notes  which are independent third parties  would absorb the first dollar of any credit loss on the conduits assets 
if credit losses exceeded the first loss notes  we would absorb credit losses through our credit facilities provided to the conduits 
the commercial paper holders would absorb credit losses after the first loss notes and state street s credit facilities have been exhausted 
we have developed a financial model to estimate and allocate each conduit s expected losses 
our model has determined that  as of december   the amount of first loss notes of each conduit held by the third party investors causes them to absorb a majority of each conduit s expected losses  as defined by fin r  and  accordingly  the investors in the first loss notes are considered to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits 
the aggregate amount of first loss notes issued by the conduits totaled approximately million as of december  in order to estimate expected losses as required by fin r  we estimate possible defaults of the conduits assets 
these expected losses are allocated to the conduits variable interest holders based on the order in which actual losses would be absorbed  as described above 
we use the model to estimate expected losses based on hundreds of thousands of probability weighted loss scenarios 
these simulations incorporate published rating agency data to estimate expected losses due to credit risk 
primary assumptions incorporated into the financial model relative to credit risk variability  such as default probabilities and loss severities  are directly linked to the conduit s underlying assets 
these default probabilities and loss severity assumptions vary by asset class and ratings of individual conduit assets 
accordingly  the model s calculation of expected losses is significantly affected by the credit ratings and asset mix of each conduit s assets 
these statistics are reviewed by management regularly and more formally on an annual basis 
if downgrades and asset mix change significantly  or if defaults occur on the conduits underlying assets  we may conclude that the current level of first loss notes is insufficient to absorb a majority of the conduits expected losses 
we perform stress tests and sensitivity analyses  with respect to each conduit individually  in order to model potential scenarios that could cause the amount of first loss notes to be insufficient to absorb the majority of the conduits expected losses 
as part of these analyses  we have identified certain conduit assets that could be more susceptible to credit downgrade because of their underlying credit characteristics 
our scenario testing specifically addresses asset classes that have experienced significant price erosion and or have little observed market activity 
examples of scenarios that are designed to measure the sensitivity of the sufficiency of the first loss notes include performing a downgrade of all assets which have underlying monoline insurance provider support  and a downgrade scenario on certain other conduit securities where our analysis of the timing and amount of expected cash flows for selected security default expectations does not re affirm the security s current external credit rating 
these simulations do not include a scenario whereby all positions are simultaneously downgraded  the possibility of which we consider remote 
in addition  a scenario could arise where one or more defaults could be so severe that the associated losses would exhaust the conduits total first loss notes currently outstanding 
we believe that the current level of first loss notes of approximately million as of december  is sufficient to support default scenarios that we believe are more likely  including the stress tests previously described 
however  in the future  if the determination and allocation of conduit expected losses by the financial model indicates that the current level of first loss notes is insufficient to absorb a majority of the conduits expected losses  we would be required to either issue additional first loss notes to third parties  change the composition of conduit assets  or take other actions in order to avoid being determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits 
if we were unable to accomplish any of the above  we would be determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits  and would be required to consolidate the conduits assets and liabilities 
for illustrative purposes only  if consolidation of all four of the conduits had been required on december   we would have recognized an extraordinary after tax loss of approximately million in our consolidated statement of income 
in addition  the consolidation of the conduit s assets would have had a direct impact on our leverage capital ratios 
the illustrative impact of consolidation of the conduits and the assumptions underlying its calculation are discussed in the off balance sheet arrangements section of this management s discussion and analysis 
the conduits do not regularly trade their assets 
that is  the design of the conduits is such that conduit assets are purchased with the intent to hold to them to their maturities 
accordingly  changes in the fair values of the conduits assets do not impact the day to day management of the conduits 
however  we closely monitor changes in fair values of the conduits assets to ensure that the default assumptions in our financial model continue to be appropriate 
as of december   total assets in the unconsolidated conduits were approximately billion  and the pre tax unrealized loss on those assets was approximately million  or million after tax 
we believe the fair values of the conduits assets are impacted by a number of factors  including the lack of liquidity of mortgage and asset backed securities  supply and demand imbalance in the market  and a risk aversion premium being demanded by investors for certain asset types 
we do not believe that the current fair values of some of the conduits assets are necessarily indicative of a change in marketplace participants view of the default probabilities for these assets 
goodwill goodwill is created when the purchase price exceeds the assigned value of net assets of acquired businesses  and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired 
almost all of our goodwill has resulted from business acquisitions of our investment servicing line of business 
as a result  substantially all of the total goodwill recorded in our consolidated statement of condition was recorded by this business line  with the remainder recorded by investment management 
the sustained value of the majority of this goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from our investment servicing business 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth  or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods  could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill  which would be evaluated and  if necessary  be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings in our consolidated statement of income 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount 
we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our two major business lines 
the evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate impairment using a two step process 
first  we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
to determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment  we use one of two principal methodologies external or independent valuation  using quoted market prices in active markets  or an analysis of comparable recent external sales or market data  such as multiples of earnings or similar performance measures 
in limited circumstances  these methodologies are not available  and as such  we estimate future cash flows using present value techniques 
events that may indicate goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business  economic or political climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  and a more likely than not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill relates 
our goodwill impairment testing for indicated that none of our goodwill was impaired 
goodwill recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at december  totaled approximately billion 
additional information about goodwill  including information by line of business  is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
income taxes our overall tax position is fundamentally complex  and management judgment is involved in the analysis of income tax assets and liabilities 
we are subject to the income tax laws of the us  its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
these tax laws can be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be adjudicated by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or administrative appeal 
management s determination of the likelihood that deferred tax assets can be realized is subjective and involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the realization of deferred tax assets arises from future taxable income  including foreign source income  and the achievement of tax planning strategies 
underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time  influencing our overall tax positions  as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances 
management continually monitors and evaluates the worldwide impact of tax legislation  decisions  rulings and other current developments on the estimates and assumptions underlying our calculations of current and deferred taxes and our analysis of the expected realization of deferred tax assets 
additional information about income taxes is in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k

as our customers execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities  they use short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities 
these liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing transaction account deposits  which are denominated in a variety of currencies  and repurchase agreements  which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our customers 
our customers needs and our operating objectives determine the volume  mix and currency denomination of our consolidated balance sheet 
deposits and other liabilities generated by customer activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities 
as a result  our assets consist primarily of high quality  marketable securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity investment securities portfolio and short term money market instruments  such as interest bearing deposits  federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 
the actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the customer liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets 
managing our consolidated balance sheet structure is a disciplined process conducted within specific board approved policies for interest rate risk  credit risk and liquidity 
for  the growth in average interest bearing liabilities of billion was primarily composed of a billion increase in customer deposits  billion of which were foreign  offset by a decline in repurchase agreements of billion 
these changes are representative of the higher levels of customer activity outside the us average interest earning assets in increased billion from  consistent with the increased level of customer liabilities

the largely floating rate asset backed portfolio consists of home equity loan  credit card  auto and student loan securities 
mortgage backed securities are split between securities of federal national mortgage association  federal home loan mortgage corporation and large issuer collateralized mortgage obligations

we had billion of net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities at december   or million after tax 
net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale securities at december  were million  or million after tax 
management considers the aggregate decline in fair value and the resulting net unrealized losses to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the investment securities portfolio 
management has the ability and the intent to hold the securities until recovery in market value 
we intend to continue managing our investment securities portfolio to align with interest rate and duration characteristics of our customer liabilities and in the context of our overall balance sheet structure  which is maintained within internally approved risk limits  and in consideration of the global interest rate environment 
even with material changes in unrealized losses on available for sale securities  we may not experience material changes in our interest rate risk profile  or experience a material impact on our net interest revenue

in addition to credit risk  cross border outstandings have the risk that  as a result of political or economic conditions in a country  borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of  or restrictions on  foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations

capital regulatory and economic capital management both use key metrics evaluated by management to ensure that our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile  is in compliance with all regulatory requirements  and is sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives 
regulatory capital our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs  including funding corporate growth and supporting customers cash management needs  and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors 
we strive to maintain an optimal level of capital  commensurate with our risk profile  on which an attractive return to shareholders will be realized over both the short and long term  while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and satisfying regulatory requirements 
our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures  our capital position relative to our peers  regulatory capital requirements and the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt 
the capital committee  working in conjunction with the asset and liability committee  referred to as alco  oversees the management of regulatory capital  and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements  internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies 
the primary regulator of both state street and state street bank for regulatory capital purposes is the federal reserve board 
both state street and state street bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the federal reserve board and defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of state street bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for the parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company 
regulatory capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for state street and state street bank were as follows as of december regulatory guidelines state street state street bank minimum well capitalized regulatory capital ratios tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier leverage ratio regulatory guideline for well capitalized applies only to state street bank 
at december   state street s and state street bank s regulatory capital ratios decreased compared to year end growth in capital from earnings and the issuance of our common stock to acquire investors financial were offset by the repurchase of our common stock under the accelerated share repurchase program and the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with the currenex and investors financial acquisitions 
total risk weighted assets increased year over year  as balance sheet risk weighted assets  partly from the investors financial acquisition  and off balance sheet equivalent risk weighted assets both grew from year end all ratios for state street and state street bank exceeded the regulatory minimum and well capitalized thresholds 
to manage fluctuations in the tier and total risk based capital of state street and state street bank resulting from foreign currency translation  we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net foreign investment in non us subsidiaries 
the notional value of these contracts was million  or approximately million  at december  in  the committee on banking supervision released the final version of its capital adequacy framework  commonly referred to as basel ii 
in  the four us banking regulatory agencies jointly issued their second draft of implementation rules  with industry comment provided by the end of march additional supervisory guidance from the agencies was released late in february  comments to the agencies were provided by the end of may  and the final rules were released on december   with a stated effective date of april  state street previously established a comprehensive implementation program to ensure these regulatory requirements are met within prescribed timeframes 
we anticipate adopting the most advanced approaches for assessing capital adequacy 
in march  our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million shares of common stock for general corporate purposes  including mitigating the dilutive impact of shares issued under employee benefit plans  in addition to its previous authorization in of up to million shares  of which million shares remained available for purchase at december  we generally employ third party broker dealers to acquire shares on the open market in connection with our stock purchase program 
under the above described authorization  during we repurchased million shares of our common stock  and an additional 
million shares in january  in connection with a billion accelerated share repurchase program that concluded on january  as of that date  approximately million shares remain available for future purchase under the combined authorization described above 
we have increased our quarterly dividend twice each year since over the last ten years  dividends per share have grown at a compound annual growth rate 
funds for cash distributions to our shareholders by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources 
the level of dividends to shareholders on our common stock  which totaled million in  is reviewed regularly and determined by the board of directors considering our liquidity  capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects  as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant 
federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company 
in addition  bank regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if they deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice 
information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item economic capital we define economic capital as the common equity required to protect debt holders against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target aa debt rating 
our entire economic capital process is the responsibility of our capital committee 
the framework and methodologies used to quantify economic capital for each of the risk types described below have been developed by our enterprise risk management  global treasury and finance groups  and are designed to be generally consistent with our risk management principles 
this framework has been approved by senior management and has been reviewed by the executive committee of the board 
due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques  we expect to periodically refine the methodologies used to estimate our economic capital requirements  which could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our risk profile 
we quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories market risk the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices  primarily as they relate to our trading activities interest rate risk the risk of loss in non trading asset and liability management positions  primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between balance sheet assets and liabilities credit risk the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty operational risk the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events business risk the risk of adverse changes in our earnings from business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of business activities  and the effect of strategic and reputation risks economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and  in some cases  external data 
these individual results are then aggregated at the state street consolidated level 
a capital reduction or diversification benefit is then applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss in each risk type at the same time 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner  and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise 
effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our customers and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions 
uses of liquidity consist primarily of meeting deposit withdrawals  funding outstanding commitments to extend credit or purchase securities as they are drawn upon  overdraft facilities  and liquidity asset purchase agreements 
liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and our balance sheet asset structure 
global treasury is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position  which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by alco 
management maintains a liquidity measurement framework to assess the sources and uses of liquidity that is continuously monitored by global treasury and enterprise risk management 
embedded in this framework is a process that outlines several levels of potential risk to our liquidity and identifies triggers that we use as early warning signals of a possible difficulty 
these triggers are a combination of internal and external measures of potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash and possible impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets 
another important component of the framework is a contingency funding plan that is designed to identify and manage through a potential liquidity crisis 
the plan defines roles  responsibilities and management actions to be undertaken in the event of a deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a state street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets 
specific actions are linked to the levels of triggers 
we generally manage our liquidity risk on a global basis at the consolidated level 
we also manage parent company liquidity  and in certain cases branch liquidity  separately 
state street bank generally has broader access to funding products and markets limited to banks  specifically the federal funds market and the federal reserve s discount window 
the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile  reflecting narrower market access 
we typically hold enough cash  primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with subsidiary banks  to meet current debt maturities and cash needs  as well as those projected over the next one year period 
sources of liquidity come from two primary areas access to the global capital markets and liquid assets maintained on our consolidated balance sheet 
our ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors in the capital markets is the first source of liquidity we would tap to accommodate the uses of liquidity described below 
on balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy 
these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets  but more importantly  they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral or through outright sales 
each of these sources is used in the management of daily cash needs and in a crisis scenario where we would need to accommodate potential large  unexpected demand for funds 
uses of liquidity result from four primary areas withdrawals of unsecured customer deposits  draws on unfunded commitments to extend credit or purchase securities  generally provided through lines of credit  overdraft facilities  and liquidity asset purchase agreements supporting the four commercial paper conduits that we administer 
customer deposits are generated largely from our investment servicing activities  and are invested in a combination of term investment securities and short term money market assets whose mix is determined by the characteristics of the deposits 
most of the customer liabilities are payable upon demand or are short term in nature  which means that withdrawals can potentially occur quickly and in large amounts 
similarly  customers can request disbursement of funds under commitments to extend credit  or can overdraw deposit accounts rapidly and in large volumes 
material risks to sources of short term liquidity would include  among other things  external rating agency downgrades of our deposits and debt securities  which would restrict our ability to access the capital markets and may lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our customers 
in addition  a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements  such as fundings under liquidity asset purchase agreements that have met draw conditions  or large draw downs of existing lines of credit  could require additional liquidity 
during the summer of  the disruption in the global fixed income securities markets  which largely stemmed from sub prime mortgages and securities collateralized by them and later spread to asset backed securities in general  caused us to invoke some elements of our contingency funding plan  resulting in more active monitoring of our liquidity position and more frequent reporting to management 
of primary concern was our ability to replace maturing commercial paper issued by the conduits 
as more fully discussed in the off balance arrangements section of this management s discussion and analysis  we have been able to reissue the paper  but with some difficulty and at higher rates of interest because of a significant decline in the demand for asset backed commercial paper in the market generally 
one action we have taken to improve our liquidity position has been the issuance of term wholesale certificates of deposit and the placement of those funds into short term money market assets where they would be available to meet cash needs 
this portfolio stood at billion as of december  it is important to note that we did not experience any deterioration in our customer deposit base  it was stable to growing during while maintenance of our high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program  on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control  and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets using our securities as collateral 
our liquid assets consist primarily of short term money market assets  such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks  the latter of which are multicurrency instruments invested with major multinational banks  and high quality  marketable investment securities not already pledged  which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to quickly generate cash 
as of december   the cash value of our liquid assets  as defined  totaled billion 
securities carried at billion as of december  were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits  borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law  and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation 
included in liquid assets are securities that have been pledged to the federal reserve bank of boston in order to secure our ability to borrow from the discount window should the need arise 
this access to the discount window  including the federal reserve s recently announced term auction facility  is an important source of back up liquidity for state street bank 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings from the discount window 
based upon our level of liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary  management considers overall liquidity at december  more than sufficient to meet state street s current commitments and business needs  including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of its customers 
in april  the parent company issued million of senior debt  consisting of million of floating rate notes due in and million of notes due in in addition  state street capital trust iv  a delaware statutory trust wholly owned by the parent company  issued million in aggregate liquidation amount of floating rate capital securities and used the proceeds to purchase a like amount of floating rate junior subordinated debentures from the parent company 
the capital securities represent an undivided preferred beneficial interest in those junior subordinated debentures  which are the only assets of the trust 
the junior subordinated debentures have an initial scheduled maturity in june and an initial final repayment date in june  each of which we may extend by ten years in specified circumstances 
in accordance with existing accounting standards  we did not record the trust in our consolidated financial statements 
the junior subordinated debentures qualify for inclusion in tier regulatory capital 
in connection with the issuance of the junior subordinated debentures  the parent company entered into a replacement capital covenant in which it agreed  for the benefit of the holders of its junior subordinated debentures due underlying the floating rate capital securities issued by state street capital trust i  that it will not repay  redeem or repurchase  and that none of its subsidiaries will purchase  any part of the newly issued debentures or the floating rate capital securities on or before june   unless the repayment  redemption or repurchase is made from the net cash proceeds of the issuance of certain qualified securities and pursuant to the other terms and conditions set forth in the covenant 
in july  we redeemed an aggregate of million of unsecured junior subordinated debentures issued by the parent company to two of our statutory business trusts  state street capital trusts a and b  composed of million of debentures issued in and million of debentures issued in we paid the trusts the outstanding amount on the debentures plus accrued interest and an aggregate redemption premium of approximately million 
this redemption premium was included in the merger and integration costs which we recorded during the third quarter of in connection with the investors financial acquisition 
additional information about these costs is in the consolidated results of operations operating expenses section of this management s discussion and analysis 
in july  the trusts  consistent with the terms of their applicable governing documents  redeemed their respective outstanding capital securities  with an aggregate liquidation amount of million  corresponding to the debentures 
the trusts paid to the holders of the outstanding capital securities the same amount that was paid by the parent company to the trusts to redeem the debentures 
in january  state street capital trust iii  a delaware statutory trust wholly owned by the parent company  issued million in aggregate liquidation amount of fixed to floating rate normal automatic preferred enhanced capital securities  referred to as normal apex  and used the proceeds to purchase a like amount of remarketable junior subordinated debentures due from the parent company 
in addition  the trust entered into stock purchase contracts with the parent company under which the trust agrees to purchase  and the parent company agrees to sell  on the stock purchase date  a like amount in aggregate liquidation amount of the parent company s non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a   liquidation preference per share 
state street will make contract payments to the trust at an annual rate of of the stated amount of  per stock purchase contract 
the normal apex are beneficial interests in the trust 
the trust will pass through  as distributions on or the redemption price of normal apex  amounts that it receives on its assets that are the corresponding assets for the normal apex 
the corresponding assets for each normal apex   liquidation amount  initially are  principal amount of the junior subordinated debentures and a th  or a  interest in a stock purchase contract for the purchase and sale of one share of the series a preferred stock for  the stock purchase date is expected to be march   but it may occur on an earlier date or as late as march  from and after the stock purchase date  the corresponding asset for each normal apex will be a th  or a  interest in one share of the series a preferred stock 
in accordance with existing accounting standards  we did not record the trust in our consolidated financial statements 
the junior debentures qualify for inclusion in tier regulatory capital 
as stated previously  our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt  as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies 
factors essential to retaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings  strong risk management  strong capital ratios  diverse liquidity sources  including the global capital markets and customer deposits  and strong liquidity monitoring procedures 
high ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by ensuring the largest possible market for our debt 
a downgrade or reduction of these credit ratings could have an adverse impact to our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates 
following our january  announcement of a net charge to establish a reserve associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by ssga  the major national rating agencies affirmed their ratings for state street and state street bank 
however  moody s investors service and fitch changed their outlook from stable to negative 
these changes have not had a material impact on our liquidity position or on our ability to access the global capital markets at reasonable rates of interest

additional information about the commercial commitments disclosed in this section is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item risk management the global scope of our business activities requires that we balance what we perceive to be the primary risks in our businesses with a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function 
the measurement  monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of our businesses 
these risks  if not effectively managed  can result in current losses to state street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation 
our systematic approach also allows for a more precise assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital 
we have a disciplined approach to risk management that involves all levels of management 
the board of directors provides extensive review and oversight of our overall risk management programs  including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of state street s key risk indicators 
these indicators are designed to identify major business activities of state street with significant risk content  and to establish quantifiable thresholds for risk measurement 
key risk indicators are reported regularly to the executive committee of the board  and are reviewed periodically for appropriateness 
modifications to the indicators are made to reflect changes in our business activities or refinements to existing measurements 
enterprise risk management  or erm  a dedicated corporate group  provides oversight  support and coordination across business units and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines 
in addition  erm establishes and reviews approved limits  and with business line management  monitors key risks 
the head of erm meets regularly with the board or a board committee  as appropriate  and has the authority to escalate issues as necessary 
the execution of duties in the management of people  products  business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers 
the function of risk management is responsible for designing  orchestrating and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards 
accordingly  risk management is a shared responsibility between erm and the business lines and requires joint efforts in goal setting  program design and implementation  resource management  and performance evaluation between business and functional units 
responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees 
the major risk committee  or mrc  is responsible for the formulation and recommendation of policies  and the approval of guidelines and programs governing the identification  analysis  measurement and control of material risks across state street 
chaired by the head of erm  the mrc focuses on the review of business activities with significant risk content and the assessment of risk management programs and initiatives 
the capital committee  chaired by the chief financial officer  oversees the management of our regulatory and economic capital  the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure and debt and equity issuances 
alco  chaired by the treasurer  oversees the management of our consolidated balance sheet  including management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions 
the fiduciary review committee reviews the criteria for the acceptance of fiduciary duties  and assists our business lines with their fiduciary responsibilities executed on behalf of customers 
the credit committee  chaired within erm  acts as the credit policy committee for state street 
the operational risk committee  chaired within erm  provides cross business oversight of operational risk to identify  measure  manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner across state street 
the model assessment committee  chaired within erm  provides unbiased recommendations concerning technical modeling issues and independently validates qualifying financial models utilized by our businesses 
several other committees with specialized risk management functions report to the mrc 
corporate audit serves in a complementary role to our program of risk management  providing the board and management with continuous monitoring and control assessments to ensure adherence to state street s policies and procedures and the effectiveness of its system of internal controls 
additionally  the internal control environment is evaluated through external examinations and regulatory compliance efforts 
the corporate compliance  regulatory and industry affairs  and legal groups also serve essential roles in risk management 
corporate compliance is responsible for the design  implementation and oversight of policies  guidelines and programs to ensure our compliance with applicable laws and regulations wherever we conduct business 
the regulatory and industry affairs group monitors proposed changes in rules and legislation  and the legal group provides counsel that enables us to deal with complex legal and regulatory environments  maximize business opportunities and minimize legal  regulatory and other risks 
while we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses  external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated 
for example  a material counterparty failure or a default of a material obligor could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
market risk market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and other market driven rates or prices 
we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and non trading  or asset and liability management  activities 
we manage our overall market risk through a comprehensive risk management framework 
this framework includes risk management groups that report independently to senior management through erm 
the process of managing market risk for these activities  discussed in further detail below  applies to both on balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures 
trading activities we primarily engage in trading and investment activities to serve our customers needs and to contribute to overall corporate earnings and liquidity 
in the conduct of these activities  we are subject to  and assume  market risk 
the level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall objectives and liquidity needs  customer requirements and market volatility 
interest rate risk  a component of market risk  is more thoroughly discussed in the asset and liability management portion of this market risk section 
market risk associated with foreign exchange and trading activities is controlled through established limits on aggregate and net open positions  sensitivity to changes in interest rates  and concentrations  which are supplemented by stop loss thresholds 
we use an array of risk management tools and methodologies  including value at risk  to measure  monitor and control market risk 
all limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers  the market risk management group and the trading and market risk committee 
we use a variety of derivative financial instruments to support customers needs  conduct trading activities and manage our interest rate and currency risk 
these activities are designed to create trading revenue or to hedge volatility in net interest revenue 
in addition  we provide services related to derivative financial instruments in our role as both a manager and servicer of financial assets 
our customers use derivative financial instruments to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities 
with the growth of cross border investing  customers have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investment and to manage the currency risk in international investment portfolios 
as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets  we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these customer needs 
as part of our trading activities  we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivative financial instruments  including foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps 
as of december   the notional amounts of all of these derivative financial instruments were billion  of which billion were foreign exchange forward contracts 
in the aggregate  long and short foreign exchange forward positions are closely matched to minimize currency and interest rate risk 
all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates 
we use a variety of risk measurement and estimation techniques  including value at risk 
value at risk is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval 
we use a system of risk management to estimate value at risk daily for all material trading positions 
we have adopted standards for estimating value at risk  and we maintain capital for market risk in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines 
value at risk is estimated for a one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of greater than one year 
a one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated value at risk more than of the time  or approximately three days out of the year 
the methodology uses a simulation approach based on observed changes in market prices and takes into account the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions 
like all quantitative risk measures  value at risk is subject to certain limitations and assumptions inherent in the methodology 
our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed 
the estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of positions held at the end of the trading day 
implicit in the estimate is the assumption that no intraday action is taken by management during adverse market movements 
as a result  the methodology does not represent risk associated with intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility 
the following table presents market risk related to our trading activities as measured by our value at risk methodology value at risk years ended december  in millions annual average maximum minimum annual average maximum minimum foreign exchange products 

interest rate products 


we compare daily profits and losses from trading activities to estimated one day value at risk 
for the years ended december   and  we did not experience any trading losses in excess of our end of day value at risk estimate 
asset and liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue  or nir  under varying economic environments  while protecting the economic values of our balance sheet assets and liabilities from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates 
most of our nir is earned from the investment of deposits generated by our core investment servicing and investment management businesses 
we structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities  but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally approved risk guidelines 
our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the board and guidelines established and monitored by alco 
our global treasury unit has responsibility for managing state street s day to day interest rate risk 
to effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related nir  global treasury has the authority to take a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons 
global treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis  and they have organized themselves into three regional treasury units  north america  europe  and asia pacific  to reflect the growing  global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position 
our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk 
we invest in financial instruments with currency  repricing  and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position 
in addition to on balance sheet assets  we use certain derivatives  primarily interest rate swaps  to alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities 
the use of derivatives is subject to alco approved guidelines 
additional information about our use of derivatives is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item as a result of growth in our non us operations  non us dollar denominated customer liabilities are a significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet 
this growth results in exposure to changes in the shape and level of non us dollar yield curves  which we include in our consolidated interest rate risk management process 
because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our risks to changes in rates  we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on net interest revenue and balance sheet values 
net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible net interest revenue results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments 
we also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates 
finally  gap analysis the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities re pricing within a specified time period is used as a measurement of our interest rate risk position 
to measure  monitor  and report on our interest rate risk position  we use nir simulation  or nir at risk  which measures the impact on nir over the next twelve months to immediate  or rate shock  and gradual  or rate ramp  changes in market interest rates  and economic value of equity  or eve  which measures the impact on the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates 
nir at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on nir in the short term 
eve  on the other hand  is a long term view of interest rate risk  but with a view toward liquidation of state street 
both of these measures are subject to alco established guidelines  and are monitored regularly  along with other relevant simulations  scenario analyses and stress tests by both global treasury and alco 
in calculating our nir at risk  we start with a base amount of nir that is projected over the next twelve months  assuming that the then current yield curve remains unchanged over the period 
our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months 
that yield curve is then shocked  or moved immediately  basis points in a parallel fashion  or at all points along the yield curve 
two new twelve month nir projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions  but with the new yield curves  and compared to the base scenario 
we also perform the calculations using interest rate ramps  which are basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve month period  rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks 
eve is based on the change in the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest 
the present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case 
we then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values 
a large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from the borrower s prepayment opportunity 
key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows  the maturity and repricing of balance sheet assets and liabilities  especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities  changes in market conditions  and interest rate sensitivities of our customer liabilities with respect to the interest rates paid and the level of balances 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the models cannot precisely calculate future nir or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on nir and economic value 
actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions  changes in spreads and management strategies  among other factors 
projections of potential future streams of nir are assessed as part of our forecasting process 
the following table presents the estimated exposure of nir for the next twelve months  calculated as of december  and  due to an immediate basis point shift in then current interest rates 
estimated incremental exposures presented below are dependent on management s assumptions about asset and liability sensitivities under various interest rate scenarios  such as those previously discussed  and do not reflect any actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest rate changes on state street s financial performance 
nir at risk estimated exposure to net interest revenue in millions rate change bps shock bps shock bps ramp bps ramp the following table presents estimated eve exposures  calculated as of december  and  assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates  the impact of which would be spread over a number of years 
economic value of equity estimated exposure to economic value of equity in millions rate change bps shock   bps shock with respect to the december  information presented in the tables above  the balance sheet of investors financial is reflected in the estimated nir at risk and the estimated eve exposure 
information for prior periods was not restated 
the incremental increases in the levels of nir at risk and eve exposure to upward shifts in interest rates are largely attributable to increased purchases of fixed rate securities in the first quarter of  slower projected prepayment speeds for mortgage backed securities effective in the fourth quarter of  and the contribution of the acquired investors financial business during the third quarter of while the dollar amount of nir at risk increased  its rate of increase was lower than the reported growth rate for nir 
while the measures presented in the tables above are not a prediction of future nir or valuations  they do suggest that if all other variables remained constant  in the short term  falling interest rates would lead to nir that is higher than it would otherwise have been  and rising rates would lead to lower nir 
other important factors that impact the levels of nir are balance sheet size and mix  interest rate spreads  the slope and interest rate level of us dollar and non us dollar yield curves and the relationship between them  the pace of change in market interest rates  and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions 
one of the most important assumptions in our management of interest rate risk is the response of customer liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
as such  we regularly reassess the characteristics of customer liabilities 
our most recent assessment was completed during the second quarter of and resulted in a small lengthening in the estimated duration of customer liabilities 
the impact of this longer estimated duration for customer liabilities reduced both nir at risk and eve exposure to increases in market interest rates  partially mitigating the factors responsible for higher interest rate risk detailed above 
credit risk credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle in accordance with contractual terms 
the extension of credit and acceptance of counterparty risk by state street are governed by corporate guidelines based on the prospective customer s risk profile  the markets served  counterparty and country concentrations  and regulatory compliance 
our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk in a variety of forms to certain highly rated entities 
this concentration risk is mitigated by comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake 
exposures are evaluated on an individual basis at least annually 
we provide  on a limited basis  traditional loan products and services to key customers and prospects in a manner that enhances customer relationships  increases profitability and minimizes risk 
we employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based upon credit quality and the overall institutional relationship 
this model is typical of financial institutions that provide credit to institutional customers in the markets that we serve 
an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable credit losses in the loan portfolio and is reviewed regularly by management for adequacy 
an internal rating system is used to assess potential risk of loss based on customer investment profile  current economic and or customer financial indicators 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate relative to the level of credit risk in the loan and lease financing portfolio 
no provision was recorded in either  or at december  and  the allowance for loan losses was million 
changes in the allowance for loan losses were as follows for the years ended december in millions us balance at beginning of year provision for loan losses loan charge offs commercial and financial recoveries commercial and financial reclassification balance at end of year us non us balance at beginning of year provision for loan losses reclassification balance at end of year non us total balance at end of year in  we reclassified million of the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities as a reserve for off balance sheet commitments 
subsequent to the reclassification  the reserve for off balance sheet commitments was reduced by million  and recorded as an offset to other operating expenses 
we also reversed million through the provision for loan losses as a result of reduced credit risk exposures and improved credit quality 
past due loans are loans on which principal or interest payments are over days delinquent  but where interest continues to be accrued 
there were no past due loans as of december     and we generally place loans on non accrual status once payments are days past due  or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable 
loans days past due  but considered both well secured and in the process of collection  may be excluded from non accrual status 
for loans placed on non accrual status  revenue recognition is suspended 
there were no non accrual loans at year end    and we purchase securities under agreements to resell 
risk is minimized by establishing the acceptability of counterparties  limiting purchases almost exclusively to low risk us government securities  taking possession or control of transaction assets  monitoring levels of underlying collateral  and limiting the duration of the agreements 
securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the borrower 
most repurchase agreements are short term  with maturities of less than days 
we also provide customers with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters of credit  lines of credit and liquidity asset purchase agreements 
these exposures are subject to an initial credit analysis  with detailed approval and review processes 
these facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed on an annual basis 
we maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities 
management reviews the adequacy of this reserve on a regular basis 
on behalf of our customers  we lend their securities to creditworthy banks  broker dealers and other institutions 
in most circumstances  we indemnify our customers for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities 
though these transactions are well collateralized  the substantial volume of these activities necessitates thorough credit based underwriting and monitoring processes 
state street requires the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the fair market value of the securities borrowed 
collateral funds received in connection with our securities lending services are held by us as agent and are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition 
the borrowed securities and collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary 
state street held  as agent  cash and securities totaling billion and billion as collateral for indemnified securities financing at december  and  respectively 
processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for other credit extensions 
as part of the approval and renewal process  appropriate due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure  as well as the quality of the counterparty 
exposures to these entities are aggregated and evaluated by erm 
investments in debt and equity securities  including investments in affiliates  are monitored regularly by corporate finance and erm 
to the extent necessary  procedures are in place for evaluating potentially impaired securities  as discussed in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item total non performing investment securities were million and million at december  and  respectively 
operational risk we define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events 
as a leading provider of services to institutional investors  our customers have a broad array of complex and specialized servicing  confidentiality and fiduciary requirements 
active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business  and responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual at state street 
our operational risk policy statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for managing operational risk 
the policy statement is reinforced by the operational risk guidelines  which codify our approach to operational risk 
the guidelines document our sound practices and provide a mandate within which programs  processes  and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified  measured  managed and controlled in an effective and consistent manner across state street 
we maintain an operational risk governance structure to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management 
business units periodically review the status of the business controls and monitor and report key risk indicator results 
erm oversees the overall operational risk management program 
the mrc and the operational risk committee review key risk indicators and policies related to operational risk  provide oversight to ensure compliance with the operational risk program  and escalate operational risk issues of note to the executive committee of the board 
corporate audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the examining and audit committee of the board 
state street s internal control environment is designed to provide a sound operational environment 
our discipline in managing operational risk provides the structure to identify  evaluate  control  monitor  measure  mitigate and report operational risk 
business risk we define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks  not already captured as market  interest rate  credit or operational risks 
we incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs 
active management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business  and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual at state street 
it is sometimes difficult to separate the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and business risks 
for instance  the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss  while the impact on our reputation and the potential loss of customers and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss 
an additional example of business risk is the integration of a major acquisition 
failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business  and the resultant inability to retain customers  would be classified as a business risk loss 
business risk is managed with a long term focus 
techniques include the careful development of business plans and appropriate management oversight 
the potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision 
we use a combination of historical earnings volatility  scenario analysis  stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on state street attributable to business risk 
management and control of business risks are generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall and strategic planning and internal risk management processes 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we hold assets under custody and assets under management in a custodial or fiduciary capacity for our customers  and  in accordance with gaap  we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition 
similarly  collateral funds associated with our securities finance activities are held by us as agent  therefore  we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition 
additional information about these and other off balance sheet activities is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item in the normal course of business  we utilize derivative financial instruments to support our customers needs  to conduct trading activities and to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk 
additional information about our use of derivatives is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item in the normal course of business  we utilize three types of special purpose entities  referred to as spes  two of which are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
information about the activities of these spes  which are used in connection with our tax exempt investment program  our involvement with managed investment vehicles and our asset backed commercial paper conduits  is in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item additional information about the commercial paper conduits is provided below 
the risks associated with providing administration  liquidity  and or credit enhancements to these special purpose entities are reviewed as part of our corporate risk management process in a manner that is consistent with applicable policies and guidelines 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and have provided adequate credit reserves to cover any risks associated with these activities 
asset backed commercial paper programs as further described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item  we administer four third party owned  special purpose  multi seller asset backed commercial paper programs  commonly referred to as conduits  the first of which was established in these conduits  which are structured as bankruptcy remote entities and are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements under existing accounting standards  are designed to satisfy the demand of our institutional customers  particularly mutual fund customers  for commercial paper 
total assets in the four unconsolidated conduits were approximately billion at december  and billion at december  the conduits obtain funding through the issuance of commercial paper and hold diversified portfolios of investments  which are predominately composed of securities purchased in the capital markets 
these investments are collateralized by mortgages  student loans  automobile and equipment loans and credit card receivables  most of which securities are investment grade 
conduit assets are not sourced from our consolidated balance sheet 
the following tables provide additional information regarding the composition of the conduits asset portfolios  in the aggregate  as of december  as of this date  none of the conduits portfolio securities were predominantly collateralized by sub prime real estate mortgages

conduit assets by asset origin amount percent of total conduit assets dollars in billions us australia great britain spain italy portugal germany netherlands greece other total conduit assets since the conduits were first organized beginning in  we have entered into contractual obligations in the form of liquidity asset purchase agreements to support most or all of the liquidity of the conduits 
we also provide credit enhancement to the conduits in the form of standby letters of credit 
other institutions can and do provide contractual liquidity to the conduits 
as provided for in these agreements  we provide back up liquidity in the event that the conduits cannot meet their funding needs through the issuance of commercial paper 
in the event that maturing commercial paper cannot be reissued into the market by the conduits dealer group  we and the other institutions providing liquidity may be required to provide liquidity by purchasing portfolio assets from the conduits 
state street may also provide liquidity by purchasing commercial paper or providing other extensions of credit to the conduits 
as of december   state streets commitments under these liquidity asset purchase agreements and back up lines of credit totaled approximately billion  and our commitments under standby letters of credit totaled billion 
the conduits generally sell commercial paper to third party investors  however  we sometimes purchase commercial paper from the conduits 
at december   we held on our consolidated balance sheet an aggregate of approximately million of commercial paper issued by the conduits 
the highest total overnight position in the conduits commercial paper held by state street was approximately billion during this was higher than the levels of commercial paper we have historically held  and was reflective of both the reduced liquidity in the asset backed commercial paper markets during the third and fourth quarters and our desire to provide short term stability to funding costs given the lack of liquidity in the marketplace 
there were no draw downs on the liquidity asset purchase agreements or standby letters of credit during as the third quarter of progressed and investors became increasingly concerned about the credit quality of the underlying assets generally held in asset backed commercial paper conduits and similar vehicles  the resulting reduction in liquidity in the global fixed income securities markets made the funding of the state street administered conduits more challenging than in normal market conditions  and the yields that issuers had to pay on asset backed commercial paper increased 
consistent with the experience of other market participants  commercial paper was generally being placed by the state street administered conduits with shorter maturities and higher investor yields than historically experienced 
this compressed the spread between the rate earned on the conduits assets and the conduits funding costs 
the weighted average maturity of the conduits commercial paper was approximately days as of december   compared to approximately days as of december  however  the conduits continue to roll over the commercial paper as it matures  ie  place the commercial paper with market participants  including state street 
we intend to continue to manage the liquidity of the programs  if and as needed  through purchases of commercial paper as necessary  however  if due to further deterioration in the liquidity of the fixed income markets or otherwise  it would become necessary to purchase assets from the conduits  we anticipate that we could fund those purchases 
during  we did not experience any losses in our role as a liquidity and credit enhancement provider to the conduits  although the margins that we generated from administration of the conduits were lower than the levels historically achieved on commercial paper issued by the conduits 
the fee revenue we generated from our involvement with the conduits was approximately million for  million for and million for we earn fees from our role as administrator  liquidity or credit enhancement provider and as one of the dealers  which fees are priced on a market basis 
these fees are recorded in processing fees and other revenue in our consolidated statement of income 
our overall conduit business activities generated pre tax income  which included the fee revenue described above  of approximately million for  compared to pre tax income of million for and million for the decrease in this income from to primarily resulted from the change in fair value of basis swaps  as well as other conduit operating expenses 
as described above  we provide the conduits with contractual liquidity in the form of liquidity asset purchase agreements 
if a conduit experienced a problem with an asset  such as a default or credit rating downgrade  subject to certain conditions  the liquidity asset purchase agreement could be invoked by the conduit  requiring state street to purchase the asset from the conduit at prices which may exceed the fair value of the assets 
if that occurred  we would be required to recognize a loss upon purchase of the asset 
any loss from a credit default would first be offset by the level of funding provided by the first loss note holders 
currently  in light of the recent reduction in liquidity in the markets  with spreads on virtually all asset classes except us treasuries having widened  we expect that an asset purchase would result in a loss 
this loss may be recovered in future periods  depending on state street s actions after the asset is purchased and market conditions 
it is also possible that we would be required to consolidate one or more of the conduits assets and liabilities onto our consolidated balance sheet 
this consolidation would occur if we were determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits as defined in fin r 
for example  if we updated our expected loss model assumptions as a result of changes in market conditions or a downgrade of securities  we may be required to increase the amount of first loss notes in order for the investors in the first loss notes to continue to be considered the primary beneficiaries of the conduits 
if the conduits are not able to issue additional first loss notes or take other actions  we may be determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits  and would be required to consolidate the conduits assets and liabilities onto our consolidated balance sheet 
additional information about our use of an expected loss model and the third party investors in first loss notes is provided in the significant accounting estimates special purpose entities section of this management s discussion and analysis and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item our accounting treatment of the conduits is reviewed at least quarterly  and more frequently if specific events warrant 
as a result of the events in the global fixed income securities markets  we reviewed the underlying assumptions incorporated in our fin r expected loss model 
we concluded as of december   that our model assumptions were appropriate and were reflective of market participant assumptions  and appropriately considered the probability of  and potential for  the recurrence of these events 
if consolidation were to occur because we were determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits as defined in fin r  we would consolidate the conduits assets and liabilities onto our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
we expect that we would recognize an extraordinary loss on the date of consolidation if the fair value of the conduits liabilities exceeded the fair value of the conduits assets  as they do currently 
this loss would be recovered back into income over the remaining lives of the assets  assuming that the assets were held to maturity and that we recovered the full principal amount of the securities 
purchasing or consolidating all or a significant portion of the assets of the conduits would affect the size and composition of our consolidated balance sheet and alter our financial and regulatory capital ratios  and may affect our earnings 
in light of our continued ability to manage the liquidity of the commercial paper  we do not currently anticipate that this action will become necessary 
however  for illustrative purposes only  assuming estimated fair values of the conduits assets as of december   if all of the conduits assets were purchased under the liquidity asset purchase agreements  or if the conduits assets and liabilities were consolidated onto our consolidated balance sheet  we estimate that we would recognize an after tax loss of approximately million in our consolidated statement of income 
this estimate assumes that all of the conduits  with total assets of approximately billion as of december   are consolidated on that date  that the assets of the conduits are recorded at fair value  which is based on state street s consistent application of its pricing policies for conduit assets  and that the pre tax loss is tax effected at a marginal income tax rate 
if this consolidation were to occur in the future  or we were required to purchase assets pursuant to the liquidity asset purchase agreements at prices in excess of the fair value of the assets  the ultimate amount of loss will be based upon market conditions at the date such a determination is made  which could differ from the estimate provided above 
if the assets were consolidated for accounting purposes pursuant to fin r  we expect that this loss would be recorded as an extraordinary loss  after income from continuing operations 
if we were to purchase the assets under the liquidity asset purchase agreements  to the extent that a loss was incurred  we expect that the loss would be recognized in continuing operations 
we consider the activities of the conduits in our liquidity management process  as more fully described in the liquidity section of this management s discussion and analysis 
we would be able to access multiple sources of liquidity to fund required asset purchases  including sales of other assets  asset repurchase agreements  the issuance of corporate commercial paper  the issuance of bank certificates of deposit and time deposits  and accessing the federal reserve discount window or similar facilities in other jurisdictions in which we maintain significant banking operations 
the consolidation of the conduits for accounting purposes alone would not require additional funding or liquidity for the conduits to fund their asset portfolios 
however  if the reasons for consolidation related to an inability of the conduits to issue commercial paper  the conduits would require additional liquidity 
if we were required to consolidate the conduits assets and liabilities  our regulatory capital ratios would be negatively impacted for a period of time 
with respect to regulatory capital  the consolidation of the conduits assets and liabilities would cause a reduction of our tier and total risk based capital ratios 
the impact of consolidation on our tier leverage ratio would be more significant  but the degree of impact would depend on how and when consolidation occurred  since this ratio is a function of our consolidated total average assets over an entire quarter 
assuming estimated fair values of the conduits assets as of december   priced as described above  if all of the conduits assets and liabilities were consolidated onto our consolidated balance sheet on december   and no other management actions were taken with respect to regulatory capital  the following table presents the estimated impact on state street s and state street bank s regulatory capital ratios 
state street state street bank reported as of december  adjusted as of december  reported as of december  adjusted as of december  tier leverage ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio recent accounting developments information with respect to recent accounting developments is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item item a
