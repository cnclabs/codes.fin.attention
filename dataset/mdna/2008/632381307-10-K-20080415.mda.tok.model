item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read together with the consolidated financial statements of national coal corp 
and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity and cash flows of national coal corp 
for the fiscal years ended december   and except for historical information  the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are based upon judgments concerning various factors that are beyond our control 
we mine  process and sell high quality bituminous steam coal from mines located in east tennessee  northwestern alabama and  until march   in southeastern kentucky 
we own the coal mineral rights to approximately  acres of land and lease the rights to approximately  additional acres 
we have expanded our operations considerably since commencing operations at a single surface mine in tennessee in july as of december   our active mining complexes included two underground mines  six surface mines  and two highwall mines 
in addition  we have four preparation plants  two active and two inactive  and four unit train loading facilities  three active and one inactive  served by the csx and norfolk southern railroads 
we hold permits that allow us to open or re open seven new mines close to our current operations 
as of december   we controlled approximately million estimated recoverable tons of coal reserves including million tons at our operations in southeast kentucky  which were sold on march  during the year ended december   we generated total revenues of million  a net loss of million  an ebitda a reconciliation of non gaap figures is presented in footnote of item selected financial data loss of  and sold approximately  tons of coal 
in october  we acquired mann steel products  inc  now national coal of alabama  a one million ton per year producer with mines located in north alabama for approximately million 
national coal of alabama operates three surface mines extracting high quality coal on leases encompassing million tons of reserves at december  we believe there are additional unproven reserves among the company s controlled or permitted properties 
we plan to continue expansion through acquisition  as possible  and to increase mine production  both as market conditions allow 
the majority of our revenues have come from the sale of coal we produce 
we have also sold coal that we purchase from third party coal producers  both on a contract and a case by case basis 
additionally  we charged third party coal producers a negotiated price per ton for coal loading services at our straight creek  kentucky loading facility until its sale on march  our revenues depend largely on the price at which we are able to sell our coal 
coal prices decreased between and decreases in coal prices are primarily due to the supply and demand balance of coal in the market  both domestic and imported  as well as the price and availability of alternative fuels for electricity generation 
continued low prices could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to generate cash flows in the future 
as a result of supply having exceeded demand during and  which resulted in reduced coal prices  we idled certain operations 
our sales agreements require our customers to buy coal from us at prices averaging over per ton  subject to customary quality adjustment provisions 
certain of our contracts provide for adjustment of coal purchase prices based on market conditions 
we plan to capitalize on emerging upswings in the pricing environment by pursuing long term contracts when economically acceptable to us 
in the interim  any uncommitted coal produced will be sold on the spot market for an economically acceptable price 
in recent years  we have expanded our production capacity 
in february  we purchased a mile short line railroad for approximately million which connects our owned reserves to the norfolk southern railroad at oneida  tennessee 
we spent an additional million to refurbish the line and make it operational 
we also acquired the baldwin preparation plant and rail load out facility in in return for the assumption of certain reclamation liabilities and spent million during to refurbish and modernize the baldwin preparation plant and rail load out facility 
these investments will provide the capability to efficiently process and transport our coal produced from our owned reserves to market 
in addition  we spent  and million on developing new mining operations in tennessee and kentucky during and  respectively 
the capital expenditures on mines  processing  and transportation should help us lower our operating costs 
also  the expenditures made on our transportation infrastructure should help reduce delivery cost to our southeast us utility customers 
when economically advantageous  we intend to utilize our increased production capacity by increasing our production 
over the longer term  we plan to permit and develop additional production capability from our current reserve base 
on november  we received  from the sale of idle real property and mineral leases at pine mountain located in kentucky  and an additional  from the sale to the same purchaser of an option entitling it to purchase for additional properties at pine mountain 
the sale of the real property and mineral leases resulted in a gain of approximately  on march   sold the real and personal property assets that comprised our active straight creek mining operations in kentucky to xinergy corp 
for  in cash 
xinergy corp 
was founded and is controlled by jon nix  who is a founder  significant stockholder  and former officer and director of national coal 
in addition to our receipt of the purchase price for the assets  the transaction also resulted in the return to us of approximately  in cash that we previously pledged to secure reclamation bonds and other liabilities associated with the straight creek operation  and relieved us of approximately  in reclamation liabilities and approximately  of equipment related debt which were assumed by xinergy in the transaction 
the sale resulted in a small gain 
we used a portion of the sale proceeds to repay the  senior secured credit agreement we entered into in october with guggenheim corporate funding  llc  as administrative agent  which indebtedness otherwise would have matured in december our financial results from operations depend heavily upon the cost of producing coal 
our primary expenses are wages and benefits  repairs and maintenance expenditures  diesel fuel purchases  blasting supplies  coal transportation costs  cost of purchased coal  freight and handling costs and taxes incurred in selling coal 
we expect that our exploration costs  totaling  in  in the next few years will be relatively significant but that our exploration costs will decline as a percentage of revenues 
because of rising fuel costs  our transportation costs have increased significantly 
given that the coal mining business is capital intensive  we expect our depreciation expenses to increase in the future we increase our capital expenditures for mining and other equipment needed to expand our business 
for additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect us and our industry  see risk factors 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to computing depreciation  depletion  amortization  accretion  the basis of reclamation and workers compensation liabilities  asset impairment  valuing non cash transactions  and recovery of receivables 
estimates are then based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  the corresponding accounts receivable and the methods of estimating depletion and reclamation expense of actual mining operations in relation to estimated total mineable tonnage on our properties 
revenue recognition 
under sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in the case of coal we mine and sell  we negotiate a specific sales contract with each customer  which includes a fixed price per ton  a delivery schedule  and terms for payment 
when applicable  freight costs billed to the customers as part of the contract price are included as coal sales with the offsetting expense included in cost of sales 
we recognize revenue from sales made pursuant to these contracts at the time the coal is loaded onto rail cars and trucks at our load out  mine  and processing plant facilities 
property  plant  equipment and mine development 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs that do not improve efficiency or extend economic life are expensed as incurred 
plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of assets which generally range from seven to thirty years for building and plant and one to seven years for equipment 
on sale or retirement  asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any related gain or loss is reflected in income 
leasing is used for certain capital additions when considered cost effective relative to other capital sources 
all leases with an initial term greater than one year are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas   accounting for leases 
these leases are classified as either capital or operating as appropriate 
leased equipment meeting the capital lease criteria of sfas is capitalized and the present value of the related minimum lease payments is recorded as a liability 
amortization of capitalized leased assets is computed on the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the initial lease term 
reserves and mine development costs are recorded at cost or at fair value in the case of acquired businesses 
our coal reserves are controlled either through direct ownership or through leasing arrangements which generally last until the recoverable reserves are depleted 
depletion of reserves and amortization of mine development costs is computed using the units of production method over the estimated recoverable tons 
costs related to locating coal deposits and determining the extractive feasibility of such deposits are expensed as incurred 
exclusive of the approximately million of property  plant  equipment and mine development  net we had as of december  was approximately million of mining equipment classified as assets held for sale 
this equipment was sold in january for a small gain 
we had no property  plant  equipment and mine  net development classified as assets held for sale at december  we review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators are present and the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  the carrying values are reduced to the estimated fair value 
asset retirement obligation 
the surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes require that mine properties be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds  reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines  and sealing portals at underground mines 
reclamation activities that are performed outside of the normal mining process are accounted for as asset retirement obligations in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
we record our reclamation obligations on a mine by mine basis based upon current permit requirements and estimated reclamation obligations for such mines as determined by third party engineering estimates 
in accordance with sfas  we determine the fair value of our asset retirement obligations using a discounted cash flow methodology based on a discount rate related to the rates of us treasury bonds with maturities similar to the expected life of a mine  adjusted for our credit standing 
in estimating future cash flows  we consider third party profit and apply inflation factors as required by sfas on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures  and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions  to reflect current experience 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation using statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
we currently use a standard option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
sfas r requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments  including employee stock options  at fair value and is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after december  we adopted this standard effective january  and have elected the modified prospective application transition method 
under the modified prospective application transition method  awards that are granted  modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
awards granted prior to the effective date should continue to be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas r with the exception that compensation expense related to unvested options must be recognized in the income statement based on the fair value of the options on the date of grant 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
mineral reserves 
we amortize our acquisition costs  development costs  capitalized asset retirement costs and some plant and equipment using the units of production method and estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves 
we review these estimates on a regular basis and adjust them to reflect our current mining plans 
the rate at which we record depletion also depends on the estimates of our reserves 
if the estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves decline  the rate at which we record depletion increases 
such a decline in reserves may result from geological conditions  coal quality  effects of governmental  environmental and tax regulations  and assumptions about future prices and future operating costs 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted fin effective january  in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within that fiscal year 
the fasb deferred the effective date of statement no 
for one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
we are still analyzing sfas to determine the impact of adoption 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
statement no 

statement no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
statement no 
is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect adoption of statement no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  business combinations sfas r which becomes effective for acquisitions occurring on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  sfas r establishes principles and requirements for determining how an enterprise recognizes and measures the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination  including non controlling interests  contingent consideration  and certain acquired contingencies 
sfas r also requires acquisition related transaction expenses and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a component of the business combination 
we expect that sfas r could have an impact on accounting for any businesses acquired after the effective date of this pronouncement 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary previously referred to as minority interests 
sfas would have an impact on the presentation and disclosure of the non controlling interests of any non wholly owned businesses acquired in the future 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   earlier adoption is prohibited 
we are still analyzing sfas to determine the impact of adoption

coal sales attributable to our tennessee and kentucky operations are as follows twelve months ended december  percent change coal sales   tons sold   average price per ton sold the approximately million decline in revenue from coal sales from our tennessee and kentucky operations in was partially the result of an  ton decline in shipments as existing sales agreements expired and sales opportunities at attractive prices were unavailable  in conjunction with a per ton decline in average sales price as a result of a softening coal market over the late and early to mid period 
two years of unseasonably mild weather resulted in decreased demand for coal reducing prices during those periods 
the increase in other revenues of  is primarily due to the increase in receipt of loading fees of  from a coal company with property located adjacent to our straight creek  kentucky operations which were sold on march  operating expenses caption twelve months ended december  percent change

cost of sales twelve months ended december  percent change cost of sales   tons sold   average cost per ton sold cost of sales consisted primarily of salary  benefits  and other compensation costs paid directly to miners  and direct costs paid to third party vendors whose goods and services were directly used in the process of producing coal inventory 
third party vendor costs include equipment leases and maintenance costs  blasting costs  fuel costs  parts and supplies  coal purchases  and transportation costs 
nca incurred  cost of sales from october through december  which increased consolidated cost of sales 
at our tennessee and kentucky operation  we experienced a million decrease in cost of sales  or when compared to on a per ton basis  cost of sales at our tennessee and kentucky operation increased or when compared to during  our tennessee and kentucky operations produced  fewer tons than in relying instead on increased purchases of coal from third parties 
as a result  overall production costs at these operations decreased million  offset by a million increase in the cost of purchased coal 
we experienced significant increases in the prices we pay for the products and services we use in our operations such as diesel fuel  tires  blasting services  roof bolts  health insurance  workers compensation costs and the per ton fees we pay to contract miners 
however  by placing less reliance on contract miners and producing more tons on owned reserves in the new river tract which do not result in royalty payments to lessors we were able to minimize the effect of the increases on our per ton cost of sales to only excluding a per ton increase in the cost of sales effect of purchased coal 
general and administrative expenses twelve months ended december  percent change general and administrative expenses   tons sold   average cost per ton sold general and administrative expenses primarily include non operations salary  benefits and related expenses  consulting expenses  legal and professional fees  insurance expenses  and travel and travel related expenses

other significant reductions were made in consulting and professional services  facilities and security  insurance costs  and travel

nca interest expense for the period of october through december  is  incurred on the notes due national coal corp 
and ncc  excluding nca  incurred interest expense of  an increase of  or when compared to the interest expense incurred by the companies in the increase for the period is primarily attributable to a full year of interest on the term loan credit facility versus approximately months in and the increase in rates on that facility due to loan modifications during the year 
rates on the term loan credit facility increased from approximately in the first quarter  to approximately in the second quarter to beginning in august nca interest income for the period of october through december  was  earned on bank balances and restricted cash in money market funds securing reclamation bonds 
excluding nca  we earned interest of  an increase of  or when compared to  as a result of increased average balances

for the twelve months ended december   our revenues were derived from coal sales to fifteen customers  eight of which were utilities  six of which were industrial customers and one of which was a coal reseller 
our five largest customers represent of our total coal sales 
the increase in coal sales during the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a increase in sales volume and the addition of a new customer partially offset by a decrease in average net sales prices  including penalties and premiums 
in  coal prices in central appalachia remained relatively unchanged despite unseasonable weather in the southeast  however  a second year of cooler summer temperatures and warmer winter temperatures in did have a large negative impact on coal prices 
also  many producers increased production to meet the higher demand 
the increase in other revenues was due to the increase in receipts of loading fees of  from a coal company with property located adjacent to ours and approximately  of wheelage revenue under a lease agreement  offset by a prior year negotiated termination of a sales contract of  operating expenses caption twelve months ended december  percent change 
del cost of sales   general and administrative expenses   depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization expense total operating expenses   del 
cost of sales the increase in cost of sales in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a increase in mined and purchased coal 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased from in to in this was primarily due to inefficiencies incurred during the early stages of opening three new mines and building significant inventories  operating the refurbished baldwin wash plant with insufficient volume to absorb fixed costs  and the start up of our short line railroad 
operating costs associated with these projects for the year totaled million 
a significant portion of the cost increase  about million was associated with the three capital projects that were completed  but then idled 
those projects were mine  the baldwin preparation facility  and the shortline railroad 
in addition to the above  three other events contributed to higher costs during the year lost production from a highwall miner due to an accident in march  higher costs associated with purchasing and processing coal from third parties  and a significant increase in our cost structure in kentucky due to the termination of a subcontractor 
general and administrative expenses the change in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to changes in three major components  increase in stock option expense primarily due to our adoption of sfas r and an accelerated vesting of executive stock options for the former ceo  the former general counsel and secretary who is also the spouse of the former ceo  and the former coo   increase in professional fees  primarily legal fees  and  increase in payroll  primarily due to an increase in corporate personnel in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses have decreased from in to in depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization expense the increase in depreciation  depletion  accretion and amortization expense in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  is primarily attributable to a increase in depreciation 
this change was due to the acquisition of million of fixed assets  primarily mining equipment  net of fixed asset disposals with a gross value of approximately million and a change in the estimated useful lives of certain mining equipment at april  had this revision been made as of january   the effect would have been to increase depreciation expense by approximately million for the year ended december  other income expense twelve months ended december percent change interest expense and financing fees   interest income   other income expense  net  the increase in interest expense for the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  is attributable to an increase in the average outstanding balance of our debt related primarily to the issuance of million of senior secured notes obtained immediately prior to year end  partially offset by a decrease in financing fees of approximately million related to our prior year bond offering and a decrease in our weighted average interest rate of approximately 
interest income increased by primarily due to larger average short term deposit balances other income expense  net of  expense consists primarily of the write off of acquisition costs and a rebate from a third party railroad agreement in the current year versus a  expense in the prior year related primarily to a loss on the early extinguishment of notes payable 
related transactions see certain relationships and related transactions included elsewhere in this report for a full description of transactions to which we were or will be a party  in which the transaction involved exceeds a material amount  and in which any director  executive officer  shareholder of more than of our common stock or any member of their immediate family had or will have a direct or indirect material interest 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  negative working capital of approximately million  and cash flows used in operations of approximately million for the year then ended 
our operations have not generated positive cash flows and the ability to do so during is not assured 
in order to fund general operating and working capital needs during and into  we raised funds through the sale of three million shares of common stock at february  at per share for a total of million and two million shares of common stock at december  at an average price of per share for a total of million 
we also sold million shares of common stock on october  for million which was used in the acquisition of mann steel products  inc at december   we had shareholders equity of million and incurred net losses of million excluding preferred stock dividends for the year then ended 
we expect that we will continue to incur net losses into the foreseeable future which will decrease our shareholders equity and may lead to an eventual shareholders deficit 
we were in a shareholders deficit position at december  and again at september  we invested million in equipment and mine development during the year ended december  including million purchased through equipment financing arrangements 
we intend to make approximately million of capital expenditures during to expand operations and an additional approximately million to maintain existing assets 
there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain financing for our planned capital expenditures 
our operating plan for includes cash receipts from sales committed under contracts or open purchase order arrangements with long time customers and the release of restricted cash from the march  sale of our southeast kentucky properties adequate to cover all planned commitments 
in early  we successfully renegotiated an existing coal supply agreement which resulted in an increase in the selling price per ton  pending final approval 
in addition  we are presently in discussions with other customers on existing coal supply agreements  and we intend to pursue other opportunities as they arise during however  if we are unable to execute our operating plan successfully  we may not be able to meet our liquidity requirements and will need to raise additional cash or discontinue operations at some of our facilities 
on april   we repaid our million credit agreement with a portion of the proceeds from the march  sale of our straight creek properties 
we intend to pursue a million revolver type credit facility in the second calendar quarter of to provide additional working capital as needed 
there are no assurances that efforts to raise additional cash would be successful or that discontinued operations would generate adequate savings to meet our obligations 
acquisition of mann steel products  inc 
on october   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of mann steel products for an aggregate purchase price of  in cash  paid primarily to the sellers except for  which was retained to repay certain indebtedness of mann steel that existed at closing 
mann steel became a wholly owned subsidiary of ncc corp 
and changed its name to national coal of alabama  inc the purchase agreement required a working capital adjustment to the purchase price within days after closing 
the working capital adjustment required that a determination be made by the seller s accounting firm as to the value of working capital  or current assets minus current liabilities  at the closing date  and that the purchase price be increased to the extent working capital exceeded zero  or decreased to the extent working capital was less than zero 
as a result of this provision  nca paid  to the sellers on december  total cash consideration was  which includes acquisition costs of  we funded the acquisition through the combination of two transactions a a sale of  shares of national coal corp 
common stock at per share for a total consideration of  and b the issuance of the notes due in a principal amount of million  for a total of  amounts were also used within nca to post collateral for reclamation bonds  pay fees and costs and for general corporate purposes 
national coal of alabama  inc is restricted in its ability to distribute cash to our other consolidated companies for use in their operations under the terms of our notes due on an annual basis  national coal of alabama can distribute cash for use in our other operations only if it meets certain ebitda based operating requirements for the immediately preceding fiscal year 
additionally  our subsidiary  national coal corporation  has entered into a management services agreement with national coal of alabama  inc that compensates national coal corporation for services that it provides to national coal of alabama  and a tax sharing agreement that requires national coal of alabama to make payments to us in respect of its tax liability 
for fiscal  we anticipate national coal of alabama s operations to provide limited cash for use in our other operations 
sale of kentucky properties on november  national coal corporation received  from the sale of certain real property and mineral leases at pine mountain  an idle mining complex located in kentucky  and an additional  from the sale to the same purchaser of an option entitling it to purchase for additional properties at pine mountain 
the sale of certain real property and mineral leases resulted in a gain of approximately  on march   our wholly owned subsidiary  national coal corporation  completed the sale of the real and personal property assets that comprised our straight creek mining operations in bell  leslie and harlan counties  kentucky to xinergy corp 
for  in cash in accordance with the terms and conditions of a purchase agreement entered into among the parties on february  in addition to our receipt of the purchase price for the assets  the transaction also resulted in the return to us of approximately  in cash that we previously pledged to secure reclamation bonds and other liabilities associated with the straight creek operation  and relieved us of approximately  in reclamation liabilities and approximately  of equipment related debt which were assumed by xinergy in the transaction 
the sale resulted in an immaterial gain 
we used a portion of the sale proceeds to repay the  senior secured credit agreement we entered into in october with guggenheim corporate funding  llc  as administrative agent  which indebtedness otherwise would have matured in december xinergy corp

cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities for the twelve months ended december    and are summarized in the following table activity twelve months ended december  amounts in thousands operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    net increase decrease in cash    operating activities net cash flows used in operating activities increased by approximately million to approximately million 
the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in net loss over  plus increases in both inventory and accounts receivable balances following our acquisition of mann steel products  inc on october  net of gains on the sale of idle assets including certain of our mineral properties at pine mountain  kentucky and increases in depreciation  depletion  amortization  and accretion 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million to million used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily the result of an increase in net loss  net of depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion and non cash stock option expense  of million 
the increase was primarily due to lower contract prices  increased purchases of coal due in part to the highwall miner damage during the year  and the termination of a financially favorable agreement with a subcontractor for the management of our kentucky properties  partially offset by increased non cash stock option expenses of million over prior year due to the adoption of sfas r and the accelerated vesting of certain executive options 
offsetting the overall decrease in cash flow from operations is a greater increase in accounts payable of million primarily attributable to the refurbishment of our baldwin preparation plant and load out facility which has taken place in and increased interest due to higher debt balances 
these and other expansion activities have also resulted in a greater increase in inventory of million in current year and million of asset retirement obligation settlements  both of which decreased cash from operations 
approximately million of expense related to the march damage to our highwall miner was reflected as cash used in operations in the first and second quarters of and was offset by an insurance settlement of approximately million received in september the net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million during the twelve months ended december  was primarily the result of a declining net loss 
when the impact of depreciation is removed from the net loss  there is an improvement of million 
the reduction of net loss is due to a significant increase in coal sales and resulting improvements in the percentage of cost of sales and general and administrative expenses 
investing activities cash used in investing activities increased million in the year ended december  over to approximately million primarily as the result of the acquisition of mann steel products  inc on october  for approximately million and million investment in reclamation bonds and other restricted cash necessary to expand our operations net of the reduced capital expenditures necessary as a result of significant capital improvements made in and cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended december  of million was primarily related to net capital expenditures of approximately million including the acquisition of a forty two mile rail line in tennessee and renovations to a processing facility in tennessee along with an increase in cash collateral supporting reclamation bonds of approximately million

the holders subsequently used approximately million of the inducement paid to purchase  additional shares of our common stock 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million to approximately million during the twelve months ended december  was primarily the result of the senior notes issued in december which decreased the need for additional funding

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risks our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us at december   we had million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and no debt under variable rate instruments 
at december   we had million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and million of debt under variable rate instruments  with our term loan credit facility making up of the variable rate instruments and equipment financing making up 
commodity risks we are subject to commodity price risk based on the fluctuating market price of coal 
we manage this risk through securing long term coal supply agreements rather than through use of derivative instruments 
in the future  as existing long term contracts expire or become subject to repricing  our coal sales will be made at then current market prices 
as a result  our revenues and net income will be significantly affected by fluctuations in the price of coal 
coal prices are influenced by a number of factors and vary dramatically by region 
the two principal components of the delivered price of coal are the price of coal at the mine  which is influenced by coal quality  and the cost of transporting coal from the mine to the point of use 
electricity generators purchase coal on the basis of its delivered cost per million btu 
the price of coal is generally in parity with oil and natural gas prices 
as macroeconomic factors affect these commodity prices  the price of coal will similarly be impacted 
the cost of operating a mine is influenced by geological characteristics such as seam thickness  overburden ratios and depth of underground reserves 
it is generally cheaper to mine coal seams that are thick and located close to the surface than to mine thin underground seams 
typically  coal mining operations will begin at the part of the coal seam that is easiest and most economical to mine 
in the coal industry  this surface mining characteristic is referred to as low ratio 
as the seam is mined  it becomes more difficult and expensive to mine because the seam either becomes thinner or extends more deeply into the earth  requiring removal of more overburden 
underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of high capital costs including costs for modern mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems and higher labor costs  including costs for labor benefits and health care 
in addition to the cost of mine operations  the price of coal at the mine is also a function of quality characteristics such as heat value and sulfur  ash and moisture content 
coal used for domestic consumption is generally sold free on board at a loading point  and the purchaser normally pays the transportation costs 
export coal is usually sold at an export terminal  and the seller is responsible for shipment to the export coal loading facility while the purchaser pays the ocean freight 
most electric power generators arrange long term shipping contracts with rail or barge companies to assure stable delivery costs 
transportation cost can be a large component of the purchaser s cost 
although the customer pays the freight  transportation cost is still important to coal mining companies because the customer may choose a supplier largely based on the cost of transportation 
trucks and overland conveyors haul coal over shorter distances  while lake carriers and ocean vessels move coal to export markets 
some domestic coal is shipped over the great lakes 
railroads move more coal than any other product  and in  coal accounted for of total us rail freight revenue and more than of total freight tonnage 
railroads typically handle approximately of us coal production  with csx and norfolk southern the dominant carriers in the eastern united states 
some products used in mining activities  such as diesel fuel  are subject to price volatility 
we use short term fuel contracts to manage the volatility related to this exposure 
foreign currency all of our transactions are denominated in us dollars  and as a result  we do not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risk
