except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  those mentioned in this report and  in particular  the factors described in item a 
risk factors 
landec undertakes no obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
overview since its inception in october  the company has been engaged in the research and development of its intelimer technology and related products 
the company has launched four product lines from this core development quickcast splints and casts  in april  which was subsequently sold to bissell healthcare corporation in august  breatheway packaging technology for the fresh cut and whole produce packaging market  in september  intelimer polymer systems that includes polymer materials for various industrial applications in june and for personal care applications in november  and intellicoat coated corn seeds in the fall of landec has three core businesses food products technology  commodity trading and technology licensing 
the food products technology segment combines the company s intelimer packaging technology with apio s fresh cut and whole produce business 
the commodity trading business is operated through apio  inc and combines apio s cal ex export company with apio s domestic buy sell commodity business that purchases and sells whole fruit and vegetable products to asia and domestically to wal mart 
the technology licensing business includes our proprietary intellicoat seed coating technology which we have licensed to monsanto and our intelimer polymer business that licenses and or supplies products outside of our food products technology business to companies such as air products and nitta 
see business description of core business 
from inception through may   the company s retained earnings were million 
the company may incur losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability in future years 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the accounting estimates that require management s most significant  difficult and subjective judgments include revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances  recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  the valuation of intangible assets and inventory  the valuation and nature of impairments of investments  and the valuation and recognition of stock based compensation 
these estimates involve the consideration of complex factors and require management to make judgments 
the analysis of historical and future trends  can require extended periods of time to resolve  and are subject to change from period to period 
the actual results may differ from management s estimates 
notes and advances receivable apio has made advances to produce growers for crop and harvesting costs 
typically these advances are paid off within the growing season less than one year from crops harvested by the grower and delivered to apio 
advances not fully paid during the current growing season are converted to interest bearing obligations  evidenced by contracts and notes receivable 
these notes receivable and advances are secured by liens on land and or crops and have terms that range from twelve to sixty months 
notes receivable are periodically reviewed at least quarterly for collectibility 
a reserve is established for any note or advance deemed to not be fully collectible based upon an estimate of the crop value to be delivered or the fair value of the security for the note or advance 
if crop prices or the fair value of the underlying security declines  the company may be unable to fully recoup its note or advance receivable and the estimated losses would rise in the current period  potentially to the extent of the total note or advance receivable 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
bad debt losses are partially mitigated due to low risks related to the fact that the company s customers are predominantly large financially sound national and regional retailers 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these provisions are determined based on specific identification for unusable inventory and an additional reserve  based on historical losses  for inventory currently considered to be unusable 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowances are established for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns  and discounts 
if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience  additional allowances may be required 
licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition a replacement of sab  sab 
initial license fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the period of the agreement when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees are recognized over the period of the agreement  including those governing research and development activities and any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
contract revenue for research and development r d is recorded as earned  based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and there is no continuing involvement by the company  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment the company is required to evaluate its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually in accordance with sfas no 
this evaluation incorporates a variety of estimates including the fair value of the company s operating segments 
if the carrying value of an operating segment s assets exceeds the estimated fair value  the company is required to record an impairment loss  possibly for the entire carrying balance of goodwill and intangible assets 
to date  no impairment losses have been incurred 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the company s income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carry back and carry forward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
at may   the company had no valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in addition to valuation allowances  the company establishes accruals for certain tax contingencies under fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no  when  despite the belief that the company s tax return positions are fully supported  the company believes that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and that the company s positions may not be fully sustained 
the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law and emerging legislation 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals as considered appropriate by management 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which the company has accrued  is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes its tax contingency accruals are adequate to address known tax contingencies 
favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company s effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate 
any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 
the company s tax contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within accrued liabilities 
stock based compensation on may   the company adopted sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
among other items  sfas r requires companies to record compensation expense for stock based awards issued to employees and directors in exchange for services provided 
the amount of the compensation expense is based on the estimated fair value of the awards on their grant dates and is recognized over the required service periods 
the company s stock based awards include stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards rsus 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company applied the intrinsic value method set forth in apb to calculate the compensation expense for stock based awards 
the company has historically set the exercise price for its stock options equal to the market value on the grant date 
as a result  the options had no intrinsic value on their grant dates  and therefore the company did not record any compensation expense unless the terms of the stock options were subsequently modified 
for rsus  the calculation of compensation expense under apb and sfas r is similar except for the accounting treatment for forfeitures as discussed below 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard to i all stock based awards issued on or after may  and ii any outstanding stock based awards that were issued but not vested as of may  accordingly  the company s consolidated financial statements as of may  and for the fiscal year then ended  were accounted for under the provisions of apb the estimated fair value for stock options  which determines the company s calculation of compensation expense  is based on the black scholes pricing model 
upon the adoption of sfas r  the company changed its method of calculating and recognizing the fair value of stock based compensation arrangements to the straight line  single option method 
compensation expense for all stock option and restricted stock awards granted prior to may  will continue to be recognized using the straight line  multiple option method 
in addition  sfas r requires the estimation of the expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the time of grant 
as a result  the company uses historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if the actual forfeitures differ from the prior estimates 
in the pro forma information required under sfas r for periods prior to may   the company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  fasb s eitf reached a consensus on issue no

to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within the fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
effective for fiscal year  the company will adopt sfas no 
 except as it applies to those non financial assets and non financial liabilities as noted in fsp fas the company does not expect such adoption to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value

which significantly changes the financial accounting and reporting for business combination transactions 
sfas no 
r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination

are to be applied prospectively in the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  as of december  and  the company had no noncontrolling interests on its consolidated financial statements 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard  but would not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

landec s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of its research and development programs  the continued development of marketing  sales and distribution capabilities  the ability of landec to establish and maintain new collaborative and licensing arrangements  any decision to pursue additional acquisition opportunities  weather conditions that can affect the supply and price of produce  the timing and amount  if any  of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the ability to comply with regulatory requirements  the emergence of competitive technology and market forces  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  and other factors 
if landec s currently available funds  together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its capital needs  landec would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners  additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to landec on favorable terms if at all 
landec believes that its debt facilities  cash from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and existing borrowing capacities will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements for the foreseeable future
