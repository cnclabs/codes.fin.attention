some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the special note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors sections of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a profitable multinational biopharmaceutical company focused on the development  manufacture and commercialization of immunobiotics  consisting of vaccines and therapeutics that assist the body s immune system to prevent or treat disease 
we manufacture and market biothrax  the only vaccine approved by the us food and drug administration  for the prevention of anthrax infection 
we use internally generated cash flows from the sale of biothrax to fund the development of a product pipeline that addresses a variety of infectious diseases and other medical conditions 
we develop immunobiotics for use against infectious diseases that have resulted in significant unmet or underserved public health needs and against biological agents that are potential weapons of bioterrorism and biowarfare 
we operate in two business segments  biodefense and commercial 
our biodefense business focuses on immunobiotics for use against biological agents that are potential weapons of bioterrorism and biowarfare 
our product candidates targeted to the biodefense market are anthrax immune globulin therapeutic  next generation anthrax vaccine and botulinum vaccines and botulinum immune globulin therapeutic 
our commercial business focuses on immunobiotics for use against infectious diseases and other medical conditions that have resulted in significant unmet or underserved public health needs 
our product candidates targeted to the commercial market are typhoid vaccine  hepatitis b therapeutic  group b streptococcus and chlamydia vaccines 
we expect to continue to seek to obtain marketed products and development stage product candidates through acquisitions and licensing arrangements with third parties 
our biodefense business has generated net income for each of the last three fiscal years 
our commercial business has generated revenue through development grant funding and an upfront license fee and additional payments for development work under a collaboration agreement with sanofi pasteur 
none of our commercial product candidates have received marketing approval and therefore  have not generated any product sales revenues 
as a result  our commercial business has incurred a net loss for each of the last three fiscal years 
product sales we have derived substantially all of our revenues from biothrax sales to the dod and hhs  and expect for the foreseeable future to continue to derive substantially all of our revenues from the sales of biothrax to hhs 
our total revenues from biothrax sales were million in  million in and million in we are focused on increasing sales of biothrax to us government customers  expanding the market for biothrax to other customers and pursuing label expansions and improvements for biothrax 
in addition to biothrax  our advanced product portfolio includes an anthrax immune globulin therapeutic candidate for biodefense indications and a typhoid vaccine and hepatitis b therapeutic vaccine for commercial infectious disease indications 
we are developing our anthrax immune globulin therapeutic in part with funding from niaid 
the wellcome trust provided funding for the phase i and phase ii clinical trials of our typhoid vaccine candidate 
we typically advance development of our biodefense product candidates only with external funding  and may slow down or put development programs on hold during periods that are not covered by funding 
our early stage product portfolio includes a next generation anthrax vaccine and botulinum vaccine and immune globulin therapeutic candidates for biodefense indications and group b streptococcus and chlamydia vaccine candidates for commercial infectious disease indications 
we have entered into collaboration agreements with the hpa for the development of a recombinant botulinum vaccine candidate and a botulinum immune globulin candidate 
the niaid is conducting and funding the phase i clinical trial of our group b streptococcus vaccine candidate 
we are actively pursuing additional government sponsored development grants as well as encouraging both governmental and non governmental agencies and philanthropic organizations to provide development funding  or to conduct clinical studies of these products 
for example  the wellcome trust provided funding for the phase i and phase ii clinical trials of our typhoid vaccine candidate 
in addition  the niaid is conducting and funding one of the phase i clinical trials of our group b streptococcus vaccine candidate 
manufacturing infrastructure we conduct our primary vaccine manufacturing operations at a multi building campus on approximately acres in lansing  michigan 
to augment our existing manufacturing capabilities  we have constructed a new  square foot manufacturing facility on our lansing campus 
we expect the facility to cost approximately million when complete  including approximately million for the building and associated capital equipment  with the balance related to validation and qualification activities required for regulatory approval and initiation of manufacturing 
we have incurred costs of approximately million for these purposes through december we substantially completed construction of this facility in  and are conducting validation and qualification activities required for regulatory approval 
this new facility is a large scale manufacturing plant that we can use to produce multiple fermentation based vaccine products  subject to complying with appropriate change over procedures 
we also own two buildings in frederick  maryland that are available to support our future manufacturing requirements 
we have incurred costs of approximately million through december related to initial engineering design and preliminary utility build out of one of these buildings 
because we are in the preliminary planning stages of our frederick build out  we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and costs that would be necessary to complete this project 
if we proceed with this project  we expect the costs to be substantial and to likely require external sources of funds to finance the project 
we may elect to lease all or a substantial portion of  or sell  one of these facilities to third parties 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses  fair value of stock based compensation and income taxes 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab sab requires recognition of revenues from product sales that require no continuing performance on our part if four basic criteria have been met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or title has passed to our customer based on contract terms  the fee is fixed and determinable and no further obligation exists  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have generated biothrax sales revenues under us government contracts with the dod and hhs 
under previous dod contracts  we invoiced the dod for progress payments upon reaching contractually specified stages in the manufacture of biothrax 
we recorded as deferred revenue the full amount of each progress payment invoice that we submitted to the dod 
title to the product passed to the dod upon submission of the first invoice 
the earnings process was considered complete upon fda release of the product for sale and distribution 
following fda release of the product  we segregated the product for later shipment and recognized as period revenue all deferred revenue related to the released product in accordance with the bill and hold sale requirements under sab at that time  we also invoiced the dod for the final progress payment and recognized the amount of that invoice as period revenue 
under previous contracts with hhs  we invoiced hhs and recognized the related revenues upon delivery of the product to the government carrier  at which time title to the product passed to hhs 
under our current contract with hhs  we invoice hhs and recognize the related revenues upon acceptance by the government at the delivery site  at which time title to the product passes to hhs 
under the collaboration agreement that we entered into with sanofi pasteur in may for our meningitis b vaccine candidate  we received an upfront license fee and are entitled to additional payments for development work under the collaboration and upon achieving contractually defined development and commercialization milestones 
we evaluated the various components of the collaboration in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf no 
 which addresses whether  for revenue recognition purposes  there is one or several units of accounting in an arrangement 
we concluded that under eitf no 
 the upfront license fee  the development work and the milestone payments under our agreement with sanofi pasteur should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
we recognize amounts received under this agreement over the estimated development period as we perform services 
we recorded the amount of the upfront license fee as deferred revenue 
we are recognizing this revenue over the estimated development period under the contract  currently estimated at seven years  as adjusted from time to time for any delays or acceleration in the development of the product candidate 
under the collaboration agreement  we are entitled to payments up to specified levels for development work we perform on behalf of sanofi pasteur 
we generally invoice sanofi pasteur in advance of each quarter for the estimated work to occur in the upcoming quarter 
we record the invoice amount as deferred revenue and  as services are completed  recognize the amount of the related deferred revenue as period revenues 
under the collaboration agreement  we also will be entitled to royalty payments on any future net sales of this product candidate 
from time to time  we are awarded reimbursement contracts for services and development grant contracts with government entities and non government and philanthropic organizations 
under these contracts  we typically are reimbursed for our costs in connection with specific development activities and may also be entitled to additional fees 
we record the reimbursement of our costs and any associated fees as contract and grant revenues and the associated costs as research and development expense 
we issue invoices under these contracts after we incur the reimbursable costs 
we recognize revenue upon invoicing the sponsoring organization 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at invoice amounts and consist primarily of amounts due from the dod and hhs as well as amounts due under reimbursement contracts with other government entities and non government and philanthropic organizations 
because the collection history for receivables from these entities indicate that collection is likely  we do not currently record an allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using a standard cost method  which approximates average cost 
average cost consists primarily of material  labor and manufacturing overhead expenses and includes the services and products of third party suppliers 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down in the applicable period inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected customer demand 
we also write off in the applicable period the costs related to expired inventory 
we capitalize the costs associated with the manufacture of biothrax as inventory from the initiation of the manufacturing process through the completion of manufacturing  labeling and packaging 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
we make these estimates as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees payable to contract research organizations in conjunction with clinical trials  fees payable to third party manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services were provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have begun to be incurred or we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us 
purchased in process research and development we account for purchased in process research and development in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for research and development costs  along with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
under these standards  we are required to determine whether the technology relating to a particular research and development project we acquire has an alternative future use 
if we determine that the technology has no alternative future use  we expense the value of the research and development project not directly attributed to tangible assets 
otherwise  we capitalize the value of the research and development project not attributable to tangible assets as an intangible asset and conduct an impairment analysis at least annually 
in connection with our acquisitions of vivacs gmbh  in july  and microscience limited  or microscience  in june  we allocated the value of the purchase consideration to current assets  current liabilities  fixed assets and development programs 
because we determined that the development programs at vivacs and microscience had no future alternative use  we charged the value attributable to the development programs as in process research and development 
the vivacs acquisition was a cash transaction  and therefore no fair value determination was necessary 
for the microscience acquisition  which was a share exchange  our board of directors determined the fair value of our shares issued in the exchange for financial statement purposes 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  on january  using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their estimated grant date fair values 
we value our share based payment transactions using the black scholes valuation model 
under the modified prospective method  we recognize compensation cost in our financial statements for all awards granted after january  and for all awards outstanding as of january  for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the date of adoption 
we measure the amount of compensation cost based on the fair value of the underlying equity award on the date of grant 
we recognize compensation cost over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
as of december   total compensation expense not yet recognized related to unvested options is approximately million after tax 
this expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the effect of adopting sfas no 
r on net income loss and net income loss per share is not necessarily representative of the effects in future years due to  among other things  the vesting period of the stock options and the fair value of additional stock option grants in future years 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas no 
under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a net deferred tax asset or liability is reported in the balance sheet 
our deferred tax assets include the unamortized portion of in process research and development expenses  the anticipated future benefit of the net operating losses that we have incurred and other timing differences between the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities 
we have historically incurred net operating losses for income tax purposes in some states  primarily maryland  and in some foreign jurisdictions  primarily the united kingdom 
the amount of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet reflects our expectations regarding our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income 
the applicable tax rules in particular jurisdictions limit our ability to use net operating losses as a result of ownership changes 
in particular  we believe that these rules will significantly limit our ability to use net operating losses generated by microscience and antex biologics  inc  or antex  prior to our acquisition of microscience in june and our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of antex in may we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to assess our ability to realize the benefit from these deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that the amount of our expected future taxable income will not be sufficient to allow us to fully utilize our deferred tax assets  we increase our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by recording a provision for income taxes on our income statement  which reduces net income  or increases net loss  for that period and reduces our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
if we determine that the amount of our expected future taxable income will allow us to utilize net operating losses in excess of our net deferred tax assets  we reduce our valuation allowance by recording a benefit from income taxes on our income statement  which increases net income  or reduces net loss  for that period and increases our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  or fin fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
financial operations overview revenues between may and february  we supplied million doses of biothrax to hhs for inclusion in the sns under a base contract for million doses for a fixed price of million and a contract modification for an additional million doses for a fixed price of million 
we completed delivery of all doses to hhs under this contract in february on september   we entered into an agreement with hhs to supply million doses of biothrax to hhs for placement into the sns 
the term of the agreement is from september  through september  the first million doses delivered under this contract were sold to hhs at a discounted price  as specified in the contract  due to the limited remaining shelf life for these specific doses 
this discounted price does not apply to the remaining million doses that will be sold to hhs under the contract 
the firm fixed price for the million doses  including the discount  is million in the aggregate 
if we receive fda approval of our pending application to extend the expiry dating of biothrax from three years to four years  hhs has agreed to increase the price per dose under the agreement for the remaining million doses 
in that event  hhs would make a lump sum payment to us reflecting an increase in the price per dose for specified doses delivered prior to approval and pay an increased price per dose for doses delivered following the date of such approval 
the aggregate value of such price adjustment is million 
if we do not receive fda approval of four year expiry dating during the term of the agreement there will be no adjustment in the price per dose under the agreement 
we delivered over million doses of biothrax to hhs under this agreement in under this agreement  we have also agreed to provide all shipping services related to delivery of doses into the sns over the term of the agreement  for which hhs has agreed to pay approximately million 
we invoice hhs for each delivery upon acceptance of biothrax doses delivered into the sns 
the agreement also provides for hhs to pay up to million in milestone payments in connection with us advancing a program to obtain a post exposure prophylaxis indication for biothrax 
these funds are payable upon achievement of specific program milestones 
in october  we achieved the initial milestone and invoiced hhs for million 
we received this payment from hhs and revenue was recognized in november since  we have been a party to two supply agreements for biothrax with the dod 
pursuant to these contracts  we have supplied approximately million doses of biothrax for immunization of military personnel 
our most recent contract with the dod  as amended in october  provided for the supply of a minimum of approximately million doses of biothrax to the dod through september as a result of a further amendment of the dod contract in june  we completed delivery of all doses to the dod under this contract prior to june  we are not currently party to a procurement contract with the dod 
we believe that the dod has a continued commitment to procure biothrax for its active immunization program 
we believe that  as a result of the october presidential directive  in the future the dod will likely procure additional doses of biothrax to satisfy ongoing requirements for its active immunization program directly from hhs and not from us 
we believe that these purchases by dod from hhs may result in additional purchases by hhs from us 
in may  we entered into a collaboration agreement with sanofi pasteur relating to the development and commercialization of our meningitis b vaccine candidate under which we granted sanofi pasteur an exclusive  worldwide license under our proprietary technology to develop and commercialize our meningitis b vaccine candidate and received a million upfront license fee 
this agreement also provides for a series of milestone payments upon the achievement of specified development and commercialization objectives  payments for development work under the collaboration and royalties on net sales of this product 
we defer the upfront license fee  milestone payments and development reimbursement payments under this agreement  and record revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
we are currently in negotiations with sanofi pasteur to amend this agreement 
in september  we received a development contract from niaid  valued at up to million  in support of non clinical and clinical studies of our anthrax immune globulin therapeutic candidate 
under terms of the development contract  we will use the funds to conduct various studies on this product candidate  including animal efficacy studies and clinical trials 
through december   we have invoiced  under this contract 
our revenue  operating results and profitability have varied  and we expect that they will continue to vary on a quarterly basis  primarily because of the timing of our fulfilling orders for biothrax and work done under new and existing contracts and grants 
cost of product sales the primary expense that we incur to deliver biothrax to our customers is manufacturing costs  which are primarily fixed costs 
these fixed manufacturing costs consist of attributable facilities  utilities and salaries and personnel related expenses for indirect manufacturing support staff 
variable manufacturing costs for biothrax consist primarily of costs for materials  direct labor and contract filling operations 
we determine the cost of product sales for doses sold during a reporting period based on the average manufacturing cost per dose for the specific earlier period in which the doses sold were manufactured 
we calculate the average manufacturing cost per dose in the period of manufacture by dividing the actual costs of manufacturing in such period by the number of units produced in that period 
in addition to the fixed and variable manufacturing costs described above  the average manufacturing cost per dose depends on the efficiency of the manufacturing process  utilization of available manufacturing capacity and the production yield for the period of production 
research and development expenses we expense research and development costs as incurred 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees to professional service providers for  among other things  preclinical and analytical testing  independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data from our clinical trials  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  depreciation of capital assets used to develop our products  and operating costs  such as the operating cost of facilities and the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates 
we expect that development spending for both our advanced stage products and earlier stage products will increase as our product development activities continue and we prepare for regulatory submissions and other regulatory activities 
we expect that the magnitude of any increase in our research and development spending will be dependent upon such factors as the results from our ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials  the size  structure and duration of any follow on clinical program that we may initiate  costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates on a large scale basis for later stage clinical trials  our ability to use data generated by government agencies  such as the ongoing studies with biothrax being conducted by the centers for disease control and prevention  or cdc  and our ability to rely upon and utilize clinical and non clinical data  such as the data generated by cdc from use of the pentavalent botulinum toxoid vaccine previously manufactured by the state of michigan 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the executive  sales and marketing  business development  finance  accounting  information technology  legal and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in cost of product sales or research and development expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
we currently market and sell biothrax directly to the hhs with a small  targeted marketing and sales group 
as we seek to broaden the market for biothrax and if we receive marketing approval for additional products we expect that we will increase our spending for marketing and sales activities 
total other income expense total other income expense consists principally of interest income and interest expense 
we earn interest on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and we incur interest expense on our indebtedness 
we capitalize interest expense in accordance with sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  based on the cost of major ongoing projects which have not yet been placed in service  such as our new manufacturing facility 
our total interest cost will increase in future periods as compared to prior periods as a result of the term loan that we entered into in june  as well as any borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
in addition  some of our existing debt arrangements provide for increasing amortization of principal payments in future periods 
see liquidity and capital resources debt financing for additional information 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues product sales revenues increased by million  or  to million for from million for this increase in product sales revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of doses of biothrax delivered  offset by a decrease in the average sales price per dose attributable to a discounted price provided to hhs due to the limited remaining shelf life for those certain doses delivered in the third quarter and first part of the fourth quarter of product sales revenues in consisted of biothrax sales to hhs of million  sales to the dod of million and aggregate international and other sales of million

contracts and grant revenues for consisted of million in upfront and development program revenue from the sanofi pasteur collaboration and million in grant revenue from the wellcome trust 
cost of product sales cost of product sales increased by million  or  to million for from million for this increase was attributable to a increase in the number of doses of biothrax delivered  coupled with increased costs associated with our annual production shut down  the related impact on production yield  and the write off of waste during the period 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million for this increase reflects additional personnel and contract service costs  and includes increased expenses of million on product candidates that are categorized in the biodefense segment  million on product candidates categorized in the commercial segment  and million in other research and development expenses  which are in support of technology platforms and central research and development activities 
the increase in spending on candidates in the biodefense and commercial segments  detailed in the table below  was attributable to increased efforts on various programs as we completed various studies and began subsequent studies and trials 
the spending for biothrax enhancements is related to preparing for and conducting animal efficacy studies to support applications for marketing approval of these enhancements  which we expect to submit to the fda in late or the spending for our immune globulin therapeutic candidate development programs related primarily to costs associated with the plasma collection and fractionation program for our anthrax immune globulin therapeutic 
the spending for the recombinant botulinum vaccine program resulted from advancing this program to the process development stage and the manufacture of clinical trial material 
the spending for the next generation anthrax vaccine program resulted from feasibility studies and formulation development of product candidates 
we continue to assess  and may alter  our future development plans for our products based on the interest of the us government or other non governmental organizations in providing funding for further development or procurement 
the spending in for our typhoid vaccine candidate resulted from the ongoing phase ii study in vietnam  which commenced in the first quarter of the spending in for our typhoid vaccine candidate resulted from ongoing work for the phase i clinical trial in vietnam  which we completed in the second quarter of the spending in for our hepatitis b therapeutic vaccine candidate resulted from preparing for and initiating our phase ii clinical trial  which commenced in the first quarter the spending in for our group b streptococcus vaccine candidate resulted from preparing for phase i clinical trials for two of the protein components of the vaccine candidate  which the niaid is conducting and funding 
both our chlamydia and meningitis b vaccine candidates are in preclinical development 
the increase in other research and development expenses was primarily attributable to spending associated with product development programs that we acquired in the acquisition of vivacs in july our principal research and development expenses for and are shown in the following table year ended december  in thousands biodefense biothrax enhancements immune globulin therapeutic development recombinant bivalent botulinum vaccine next generation anthrax vaccine total biodefense commercial typhoid vaccine hepatitis b therapeutic vaccine group b streptococcus vaccine chlamydia vaccine meningitis b vaccine total commercial other total selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was driven by an increase in our headquarters and staff organization to support our operations as a public company and to support the overall growth of our business  and is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million resulting from the addition of personnel and increased legal and other professional services for our headquarters organization and an increase of million in sales and marketing expenses related to the growth of our staff and an increase in our selling and marketing activities 
the majority of the expense is attributed to the biodefense segment  in which selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million for selling  general and administrative expenses related to our commercial segment increased by million  or  to million for from million for purchased in process research and development in july  we recorded a non cash charge for purchased in process research and development of  associated with our acquisition of vivacs 
we paid total purchase consideration of  and assumed a net deficit of liabilities in excess of assets of  we valued the acquisition at  after the inclusion of acquisition costs 
of this amount  we identified  as current assets   as fixed assets   as current liabilities and  as the value attributable to development programs and technology 
because we determined that the development programs and technology had no future alternative use  we charged the value attributable to the development programs and technology as purchased in process research and development 
total other income expense total other income expense increased by million to income of million for from expense of  for this increase resulted primarily from an increase in interest income of million as a result of higher investment return on increased average cash balances  including the net proceeds of our initial public offering  and a decrease in interest expense of million due to the capitalization of interest costs related to the construction of our new building in lansing 
income taxes provision for income taxes decreased by million  or  to million for from million for the provision for income taxes for resulted primarily from our income before provision for income taxes of million and an effective annual tax rate of 
the provision for income taxes for resulted primarily from our income before provision for income taxes of million and an effective annual tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective annual tax rate is due primarily to a reduction in state valuation allowances related to the expected utilization of net operating losses 
the provision for income taxes also reflects research and development tax credits of  for and  for year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues product sales revenues increased by million  or  to million for from million for this increase in product sales revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of doses of biothrax delivered 
product sales revenues in consisted of biothrax sales to hhs of million  sales to the dod of million and aggregate international and other sales of  product sales revenues in consisted of biothrax sales to hhs of million  sales to the dod of million and aggregate international and other sales of million

contracts and grants revenues for resulted from reimbursement from the dod for expenses related to production development and supply chain management improvements for biothrax incurred in prior periods  and for additional work that we performed on a project basis for the dod s darpa  to evaluate a new vaccine adjuvant for biothrax 
cost of product sales cost of product sales decreased by million  or  to million for from million for this decrease was attributable to improved utilization of our manufacturing capacity for biothrax  partially offset by an increase of approximately  biothrax doses delivered 
manufacturing efficiencies resulted in a cost savings of million 
the increase in the number of doses delivered resulted in an increase of costs of approximately million 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million for this increase reflects additional personnel and contract service costs  and includes increased expenses of million on product candidates that are categorized in the biodefense segment and million on product candidates that are categorized in the commercial segment  offset by a reduction of  in other research and development expenses 
the increase in spending on candidates in the biodefense segment was attributable to increased efforts on all our programs as we completed various studies and began subsequent studies and trials 
the increase in spending for biothrax enhancements is related to preparing for animal efficacy studies to support applications for marketing approval of these enhancements  which we expect to submit to the fda in late or the increase in spending for immune globulin therapeutic development related primarily to costs associated with our plasma collection program for our anthrax immune globulin therapeutic candidate 
the increase in spending for the recombinant botulinum vaccine program  which is in preclinical development  resulted from advancing this program to the process development stage and the manufacture of clinical trial material 
the increase in spending for the next generation anthrax vaccine program  which has product candidates in preclinical and phase i clinical development  resulted from feasibility studies and formulation development of product candidates 
the increase in commercial spending was mainly attributable to spending on the commercial products listed in the table below following our acquisition of microscience in june research and development spending by microscience prior to our acquisition of microscience in june is not included in our results for the spending for our typhoid vaccine candidate resulted from ongoing work for the phase i clinical trial in vietnam that we completed in and preparing for our phase ii clinical trial in vietnam that we initiated in the first quarter of the spending in for our hepatitis b therapeutic vaccine candidate resulted from preparing for our phase ii clinical trial  which we received regulatory clearance to commence in the fourth quarter of the spending in for our group b streptococcus vaccine candidate resulted from costs associated with our analysis of results from the phase i clinical trial for one of the protein components of the vaccine candidate and preparation for phase i clinical trials for two of the protein components of the vaccine candidate 
in december  we signed an agreement with the niaid under which the niaid has agreed to sponsor a phase i clinical trial of each of the two components separately and the two proteins in combination in healthy human volunteers

our line of credit with fifth third bank is secured by accounts receivable under our dod and hhs contracts

tax benefits in connection with our facility expansion in lansing  the state of michigan and the city of lansing have provided us a variety of tax credits and abatements 
we estimate that the total value of these tax benefits may be up to million over a period of up to years  beginning in these tax benefits are primarily based on our million planned investment in our lansing facility 
in addition  we must maintain a specified number of employees in lansing to continue to qualify for these tax benefits 
funding requirements we expect to continue to fund our anticipated operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service requirements from existing cash and cash equivalents  revenues from biothrax product sales and other committed sources of funding 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biothrax product sales and with the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we may seek to raise additional external debt financing to provide additional financial flexibility 
our committed external sources of funds consist of the remaining borrowing availability under our revolving line of credit with fifth third bank  development funding under our collaboration agreement with sanofi pasteur and funding from the niaid  including for studies related to our anthrax immune globulin therapeutic product candidate 
our ability to borrow additional amounts under our loan agreements is subject to our satisfaction of specified conditions 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the level and timing of biothrax product sales and cost of product sales  the timing of  and the costs involved in validation and qualification activities related to our new manufacturing facility in lansing  michigan and the build out of our manufacturing facility in frederick  maryland  the scope  progress  results and costs of our preclinical and clinical development activities  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the number of  and development requirements for  other product candidates that we may pursue  the costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies  our ability to obtain development funding from government entities and non government and philanthropic organizations  and our ability to establish and maintain collaborations  such as our collaboration with sanofi pasteur 
we may require additional sources of funds for future acquisitions that we may make or  depending on the size of the obligation  to meet balloon payments upon maturity of our current borrowings 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
additional equity or debt financing  grants  or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs or reduce our planned commercialization efforts 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties  it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
effects of inflation our most liquid assets are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our intellectual property 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets are not affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources

 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities  or eitf no 
eitf no 
states that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions

 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements

therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we anticipate that the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash that have maturities of less than three months 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure or foreign currency exchange exposure 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a significant impact on the realized value of our investments  but would likely increase the interest expense associated with our debt
