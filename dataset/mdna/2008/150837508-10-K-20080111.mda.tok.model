item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview cel sci s most advanced product  multikine  which is cleared for a phase iii clinical trial in the us and in canada  is being developed for the treatment of cancer 
it is the first of a new class of cancer immunotherapy drugs called immune simulators 
it simulates the activities of a healthy person s immune system  which battles cancer every day 
multikine is multi targeted  it is the only cancer immunotherapy that both kills cancer cells in a targeted fashion and activates the general immune system to destroy the cancer 
we believe multikine is the first immunotherapeutic agent being developed as a first line standard of care treatment for cancer and it is cleared for a global phase iii clinical trial in advanced primary previously untreated head and neck cancer patients 
multikine is a new type of immunotherapy in that it is a comprehensive immunotherapy  incorporating both active and passive immune activity 
a comprehensive immunotherapy most closely resembles the workings of the natural immune system in the sense that it works on multiple fronts in the battle against cancer 
a comprehensive immunotherapy causes a direct and targeted killing of the tumor cells and activates the immune system to produce a more robust and sustainable anti tumor response 
multikine is designed to target the tumor micro metastases that are mostly responsible for treatment failure 
the basic concept is to add multikine to the current cancer treatments with the goal of making the overall cancer treatment more successful 
phase ii data indicated that multikine treatment resulted in a substantial increase in the survival of patients 
the lead indication is advanced primary previously untreated head neck cancer about  new cases per annum 
since multikine is not tumor specific  it may also be applicable in many other solid tumors 
we believe multikine is the first immunotherapeutic agent being developed as a first line treatment for cancer 
it is administered prior to any other cancer therapy because that is the period when the anti tumor immune response can still be fully activated 
once the patient has had surgery or has received radiation and or chemotherapy  the immune system is severely weakened and is less able to mount an effective anti tumor immune response 
to date  other immunotherapies have been administered later in cancer therapy ie  after radiation  chemotherapy  surgery 
cel sci also owns a pre clinical technology called leaps ligand epitope antigen presentation system 
the lead product derived from this technology is the cel peptide which has shown protection in animals against herpes  viral encephalitis  malaria and cancer 
since inception  cel sci has financed its operations through the issuance of equity securities  convertible notes  loans and certain research grants 
cel sci s expenses will likely exceed its revenues as it continues the development of multikine and brings other drug candidates into clinical trials 
until such time as cel sci becomes profitable  any or all of these financing vehicles or others may be utilized to assist cel sci s capital requirements 
results of operations fiscal grant revenues and other decreased by approximately  during the year ended september  compared to the previous year due to the completion of the grant in march during the year ended september   research and development expenses increased by approximately  compared to the year ended september  this increase was due to work on two new cel projects and the use of lab supplies in the preparation for the beginning of the phase iii trials on multikine 
during the year ended september   general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  compared to the year ended september  this change was primarily due to increased public relations  presentations and strategic consulting agreements approximately  additional accounting expenses relating to the valuation of the series k notes and warrants approximately  and  increased travel by cel sci s employees approximately 
during the year ended september   interest income increased by approximately  compared to the year ended september  due to interest earned on the funds received from the sale of the series k notes and the shares of common stock sold in april the gain on derivative instruments of approximately  for the year ended september   was the result of the change in fair value of the series k notes and warrants during the period 
the interest expense of approximately  for the year ended september  was composed of two elements amortization of the discounted series k notes approximately  and interest paid and accrued on the series k warrants approximately 
fiscal grant revenues and other decreased by approximately  during the year ended september   compared to fiscal  due to the winding down of the work funded by the grants in related to grants received in cel sci is continuing to apply for grants to support its work 
during the year ended september   general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  this change was largely due to costs related to the restatement of the financial statements approximately  an increase in public relations and corporate presentation expenses approximately  an increase in filing and registration fees approximately  and the employee stock option expense required by sfas r approximately 
interest income during the year ended september increased by approximately  the increase was due to an increase of the cash balances in the interest bearing accounts from the sale of the series k convertible debt 
the issuance of the series k convertible debt in the summer of resulted in an additional charge of approximately  this charge included  paid as fees to the agent  legal fees and  in placement warrants issued to the agent 
the remaining  approximate represent the immediate charge upon issuance of the convertible debt for the fair value accounting for the debt and the warrants 
this charge is a non cash charge 
the interest expense of  is a result of the amortization of the discount on the convertible debt  and actual interest paid in stock and cash  for the interest expense on the series k convertible debt 
the gain on derivative instruments of approximately  for the year ended september  was the result of several factors a decrease in the value of the stock between the date of the issuance august of the series k convertible debt and september  resulted in the biggest part of the gain  reclassification to equity of all previous derivative instruments  and expiration of the series e warrants 
cel sci s future financial statements are expected to show significant gains and losses on derivative instruments due to the requirement to mark the value of the convertible debt to market  as measured by the stock price of cel sci s common stock 
research and development expenses during the five years ended september  cel sci s research and development efforts involved multikine and leaps the table below shows the research and development expenses associated with each project during this five year period 
multikine      leaps      total in january  fda gave the go ahead for the phase iii clinical trial which had earlier been cleared by the canadian regulatory agency  the biologics and genetic therapies directorate 
as explained in item of this report  as of september   cel sci was involved in a number of pre clinical studies with respect to its leaps technology 
as with multikine  cel sci does not know what obstacles it will encounter in future pre clinical and clinical studies involving its leaps technology 
consequently  cel sci cannot predict with any certainty the funds required for future research and clinical trials and the timing of future research and development projects 
clinical and other studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval of a new drug involve significant costs and require several years to complete 
the extent of cel sci s clinical trials and research programs are primarily based upon the amount of capital available to cel sci and the extent to which cel sci has received regulatory approvals for clinical trials 
the inability of cel sci to conduct clinical trials or research  whether due to a lack of capital or regulatory approval  will prevent cel sci from completing the studies and research required to obtain regulatory approval for any products which cel sci is developing 
without regulatory approval  cel sci will be unable to sell any of its products 
since all of cel sci s projects are under development  cel sci cannot predict when it will be able to generate any revenue from the sale of any of its products 
liquidity and capital resources cel sci has had only limited revenues from operations since its inception in march l cel sci has relied primarily upon proceeds realized from the public and private sale of its common and preferred stock and convertible notes to meet its funding requirements 
funds raised by cel sci have been expended primarily in connection with the acquisition of an exclusive worldwide license to  and later purchase of  certain patented and unpatented proprietary technology and know how relating to the human immunological defense system  patent applications  the repayment of debt  the continuation of research and development sponsored by cel sci  administrative costs and construction of laboratory facilities 
inasmuch as cel sci does not anticipate realizing revenues until such time as it enters into licensing arrangements regarding the technology and know how licensed to it which could take a number of years  cel sci is mostly dependent upon the proceeds from the sale of its securities to meet all of its liquidity and capital resource requirements 
during fiscal year  cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately  million over fiscal year  from approximately  to  net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately  the cash was primarily from the sale of common stock  and the exercise of stock options approximately  offset by principal payments on convertible debt 
the cash used for investing activities totaled approximately  the cash was used for purchases of equipment approximately  expenditures for patent costs approximately  cash restricted in escrow for use in equipping the manufacturing facility approximately  and costs for building the manufacturing facility approximately 
net cash used for operating activities was approximately  the major uses of cash for operating activities was the gain on derivative instruments approximately  and the net loss of approximately  this was partially offset by stock and options issued to employees approximately  stock and options issued to outsiders approximately  and amortization of the discount on the convertible debt approximately 
the company s working capital at september  was  compared to  at september  the convertible debt is the only debt that the company has outstanding 
the company believes that this will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements for the next months 
in august  cel sci leased a building near baltimore  maryland 
the building  which consists of approximately  square feet  will be remodeled in accordance with cel sci s specifications so that it can be used by cel sci to manufacture multikine for cel sci s phase iii clinical trials and sales of the drug if approved by the fda 
the lease is for a term of twenty years and requires annual base rent payments of  during the first year of the lease 
the annual base rent escalates each year at 
cel sci is also required to pay all real and personal property taxes  insurance premiums  maintenance expenses  repair costs and utilities 
the lease allows cel sci  at its election  to extend the lease for two ten year periods or to purchase the building at the end of the year lease 
the lease required cel sci to pay  towards the remodeling costs  which will be recouped by reductions in the annual base rent of  in years six through twenty of the lease 
regulatory authorities prefer to see biologics  such as multikine  manufactured for commercial sale in the same facility used to produce dosages used in phase iii clinical trials since this arrangement helps to ensure that the drug lots used to conduct the clinical trials will be consistent with those that nay be subsequently sold commercially 
although some biotech companies outsource their manufacturing  this can prevent problems since biologics require intense manufacturing and process control 
with biologic products a minor change in manufacturing and process control can result in a major change in the final product 
good and consistent manufacturing and process control is critical and is best assured if the product is manufactured and controlled in the manufacturer s own facility by its own specially trained personnel 
on august   cel sci sold series k convertible notes  plus series k warrants  to independent private investors for  the notes bear interest annually at the greater of or month libor plus per year 
the notes are due and payable on august  and are secured and collateralized by substantially all of cel sci s assets 
interest is payable quarterly with the first interest payment calculation due on september  this interest payment was paid on october  beginning march  cel sci is required to make monthly payments of  toward the principal amount of the notes 
if cel sci fails to make any interest or principal payment when due  the notes will become immediately due and payable 
at cel sci s election  and under certain conditions  cel sci may use shares of its common stock to make interest and principal payments 
at the holder s option the series k notes are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of 
if cel sci sells any additional shares of common stock  or any securities convertible into common stock at a price below the then applicable conversion price  the conversion price will be lowered to the price at which the shares were sold or the lowest price at which the securities are convertible  as the case may be 
if cel sci sells any additional shares of common stock  or any securities convertible into common stock at a price above the conversion price  but below the average closing price of cel sci s common stock over the five trading days prior to the sale of the shares  the conversion price will be lowered to a price determined by a formula contained in the notes 
the conversion price will also be proportionately adjusted in the event of any stock splits 
cel sci has filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission so that the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the series k notes or the exercise of the series k warrants may be resold in the public market 
cel sci is required to keep the registration statement continuously effective until the shares covered by the registration statement have been sold or can be sold pursuant to rule k 
if cel sci fails to comply with this provision  cel sci will be required to pay damages to the holders of the notes 
at any time after august  any note holder will have the right to require cel sci to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the notes  plus all accrued but unpaid interest 
the series k warrants allow the holders to purchase up to  shares of cel sci s common stock at a price of per share at any time prior to february  the exercise price of the series k warrants  as well as the shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants  will be proportionately adjusted in the event of any stock splits 
if cel sci sells any additional shares of common stock  or any securities convertible into common stock at a price below the then applicable exercise price of the series k warrants  the warrant exercise price will be lowered to the price at which the shares were sold or the lowest price at which the securities are convertible  as the case may be 
if cel sci sells any additional shares of common stock or any securities convertible into common stock at a price above the exercise price but below the market price of cel sci s common stock  the exercise price of the series k warrants will be lowered to a price determined by a formula contained in the warrants 
during the year ended september    in series k notes were converted into  shares of common stock 
in addition  principal payments of  in cash and  in shares of common stock were made to the holders of the series k notes 
as of september   the outstanding principal on the series k notes was  as of in april cel sci raised  from the sale of  shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
the investors who purchased the shares also received warrants which entitle the holders to purchase  shares of cel sci s common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the warrants expire on march  as a result of the april financing  and in accordance with the terms of the series k notes and warrants  the conversion price of the series k notes was reduced to and the exercise price of the series k warrants was reduced to 
clinical and other studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval of a new drug involve significant costs and require several years to complete 
the extent of cel sci s clinical trials and research programs are primarily based upon the amount of capital available to cel sci and the extent to which cel sci has received regulatory approvals for clinical trials 
the inability of cel sci to conduct clinical trials or research  whether due to a lack of capital or regulatory approval  will prevent cel sci from completing the studies and research required to obtain regulatory approval for any products which cel sci is developing 
without regulatory approval  cel sci will be unable to sell any of its products 
future capital requirements cel sci plans to use its existing financial resources  and any proceeds received from the exercise of cel sci s outstanding warrants or options to fund its capital requirements during the year ending september  other than funding operating losses  funding its research and development program  and paying its liabilities  cel sci does not have any material capital commitments 
material future liabilities as of september  are as follows contractual obligations 
del years ending september  total thereafter operating leases        employment contracts     del 
it should be noted that substantial funds will be needed for the clinical trial which will be necessary before cel sci will be able to apply to the fda for approval to sell any products which may be developed on a commercial basis throughout the united states 
in the absence of revenues  cel sci will be required to raise additional funds through the sale of securities  debt financing or other arrangements in order to continue with its research efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available or be available on favorable terms 
it is the opinion of management that sufficient funds are available to meet cel sci s liabilities and commitments as they come due during fiscal ultimately  cel sci must complete the development of its products  obtain appropriate regulatory approvals and obtain sufficient revenues to support its cost structure 
since all of cel sci s projects are under development cel sci cannot predict with any certainty the funds required for future research and clinical trials  the timing of future research and development projects  or when it will be able to generate any revenue from the sale of any of its products 
cel sci s cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates on its certificates of deposit  and  to an immaterial extent  foreign currency exchange rates 
critical accounting policies cel sci s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  certain accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgments by management 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
these estimates are based on cel sci s historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry and information available from outside sources  as appropriate 
cel sci s significant accounting policies include patents patent expenditures are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over years 
in the event changes in technology or other circumstances impair the value or life of the patent  appropriate adjustment in the asset value and period of amortization is made 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  and from disposition  is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of the impairment loss is the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
stock options and warrants sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize expense associated with share based compensation arrangements  including employee stock options  using a fair value based option pricing model 
sfas no 
r applies to all transactions involving issuance of equity by a company in exchange for goods and services  including employees 
using the modified prospective transition method of adoption  cel sci reflects compensation expense in the financial statements beginning october  the modified prospective transition method does not require restatement of prior periods to reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
as such  compensation expense will be recognized for awards that were granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled on or after october  options to non employees are accounted for in accordance with fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
accordingly  compensation is recognized when goods or services are received and is measured using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires cel sci s management to make assumptions regarding the fair value of the options at the date of grant and the expected life of the options 
asset valuations and review for potential impairments cel sci reviews its fixed assets every fiscal quarter 
this review requires that cel sci make assumptions regarding the value of these assets and the changes in circumstances that would affect the carrying value of these assets 
if such analysis indicates that a possible impairment may exist  cel sci is then required to estimate the fair value of the asset and  as deemed appropriate  expense all or a portion of the asset 
the determination of fair value includes numerous uncertainties  such as the impact of competition on future value 
cel sci believes that it has made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether its long lived assets have been impaired  however  if there is a material change in the assumptions used in its determination of fair values or if there is a material change in economic conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  cel sci could be required to recognize certain impairment charges in the future 
as a result of the reviews  no changes in asset values were required 
prepaid expenses and laboratory supplies the majority of prepaid expenses consist of bulk purchases of laboratory supplies used on a daily basis in the lab and items that will be used for future production 
the items in prepaid expenses are expensed when used in production or daily activity as research and development expenses 
these items are disposables and consumables and can be used for both the manufacturing of multikine for clinical studies and in the laboratory for quality control and bioassay use 
they can be used in training  testing and daily laboratory activities 
other prepaid expenses are payments for services over a long period and are expensed over the time period for which the service is rendered 
derivative instruments cel sci enters into financing arrangements that consist of freestanding derivative instruments or are hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivative features 
cel sci accounts for these arrangement in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  eitf  as well as related interpretations of these standards 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  derivative instruments and hybrid instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and are measured at fair value with gains or losses recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the derivative or hybrid instruments 
embedded derivatives that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract are bifurcated and recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings if they can be reliably measured 
when the fair value of embedded derivative features can not be reliably measured  cel sci measures and reports the entire hybrid instrument at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings 
cel sci determines the fair value of derivative instruments and hybrid instruments based on available market data using appropriate valuation models  giving consideration to all of the rights and obligations of each instrument and precluding the use of blockage discounts or premiums in determining the fair value of a large block of financial instruments 
fair value under these conditions does not necessarily represent fair value determined using valuation standards that give consideration to blockage discounts and other factors that may be considered by market participants in establishing fair value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
cel sci enters into financing arrangements that are or include freestanding derivative instruments or that are or include hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivative features 
cel sci does not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
additional information is presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of these instruments is affected primarily by volatility of the trading prices of the cel sci s common stock 
for the years ended september   and  cel sci recognized a gain of  a gain of  and a gain of  respectively  resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments 
cel sci has no exposure to risks associated with foreign exchange rate changes because none of the operations of cel sci are transacted in a foreign currency 
the interest rate risk on investments is considered immaterial due to the dollar value of investments as of september   and
