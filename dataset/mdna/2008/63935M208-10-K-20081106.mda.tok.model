all statements other than statements of historical information provided herein are forward looking statements and may contain information about financial results  economic conditions  trends and known uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  which include those discussed in this section and elsewhere in this report under item a 
risk factors and the risks discussed in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis  judgment  belief or expectation only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
overview we provide our services to customers typically pursuant to agreements with a term of one to five years with monthly payment installments 
as a result  these agreements provide us with a base of recurring revenue 
our revenue increases by adding new customers or selling additional services to existing customers 
our overall base of recurring revenue is affected by new customers  renewals or terminations of agreements with existing customers 
a large portion of the costs to operate our data centers  such as rent  product development and general and administrative expenses  does not depend strictly on the number of customers or the amount of services we provide 
as we add new customers or new services to existing customers  we generally incur limited incremental costs relating to telecommunications  utilities  hardware and software costs and payroll expenses 
we have substantial capacity to add customers to our data centers 
our relatively fixed cost base  sufficient capacity for expansion and limited incremental variable costs provide us with the opportunity to grow profitably 
however  these same fixed costs present us with the risk that we may incur losses if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue 
in recent years  we have grown through acquisitions of new businesses and have restructured our historical operations 
specifically  in december  we acquired clearblue technologies management  inc a wholly owned subsidiary of our majority stockholder at the time of the acquisition and therefore was accounted for as a common control merger cbtm  adding application management and development capabilities to our managed application services 
in february  we acquired avasta  inc avasta  adding capabilities to our managed application services 
in april  we acquired conxion corporation conxion  providing key services to our managed application services and managed infrastructure services 
in may  we acquired assets of interliant  inc  forming the core of our managed messaging services

in june  we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of surebridge  inc surebridge  adding significant capabilities to our managed application and professional services businesses 
prior to september  substantially all of our services were managed application services 
we have added managed infrastructure and managed messaging services and increased managed applications and professional services since that time 
this transformation in our business will result in our recent results being more relevant to an understanding of our business than our historical results 
we also expect to make additional acquisitions to take advantage of our available capacity  which will have significant effects on our future financial condition and results of operations 
our acquisitions of cbtm and the assets and certain liabilities of cbt were accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interest due to common control ownership 
the assets and the liabilities of cbt  cbtm and navisite were combined at their historical amounts beginning on september   the date on which cbt obtained a majority ownership of navisite 
our acquisitions of avasta and conxion  selected assets of interliant  inc and our acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of surebridge  inc were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and as such  the results of operations and cash flows relating to these acquisitions were included in our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows from their respective dates of acquisition of february   april   may  and june

table of contents income tax expense the company recorded million of deferred income tax expense for the fiscal year ended july   million more that the amounts recorded for the years ended july  and july  no income tax benefit was recorded for the losses incurred due to a valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax expense resulted from tax goodwill amortization related to the surebridge asset acquisition in june  the acquisition of certain appliedtheory corporation assets by cbtm prior to the pooling of interests in december  the asset acquisition of alabanza in september  and the asset acquisition of icommerce  inc in october accordingly  the acquired goodwill and intangible assets for these acquisitions are amortizable for tax purposes over fifteen years 
for financial statement purposes  goodwill is not amortized for any of these acquisitions but is tested for impairment annually 
tax amortization of goodwill results in a taxable temporary difference which will not reverse until the goodwill is impaired or written off 
the resulting taxable temporary difference may not be offset by deductible temporary differences currently available  such as net operating loss carryforwards  which expire within a definite period 
discontinued operations during the year ended july   the company s loss from discontinued operations was million 
the discontinued operations relates to the company s employment services operation called america s job exchange aje

net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for the fiscal year ended july  resulted from the funding of our net loss of million  million in net changes in operating assets and liabilities offset by a loss on debt extinguishment of million  non cash charges of million and million gain on settlement of the appliedtheory litigation 
at july   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
during fiscal year  the company entered into a deposit agreement to secure additional data center space in the uk  totaling million which is reflected as a million use of cash and is included in the total use of cash related to net change in operating assets and liabilities of million 
excluding the million deposit  which was returned to the company in september  the company generated million in net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended july  our revolving credit facility with our lending group allows for maximum borrowing of million and expires in june outstanding amounts will bear interest at either the libor rate plus or the base rate  as defined in the credit agreement  plus the federal funds effective rate plus  at the company s option 
upon the attainment of a consolidated leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  of no greater than  the interest rate under the libor option can decrease to libor plus 
in june the credit agreement was modified to increase the applicable margin of the loan to either for libor or for abr loans and minimum libor was fixed at 
interest becomes due and is payable quarterly in arrears 

table of contents the company believes that our existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and existing amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are obligated under various capital and operating leases for facilities and equipment 
future minimum annual rental commitments under capital and operating leases and other commitments  as of july   are as follows less than more than description total year years years years in thousands short long term debt interest on debt a capital leases bandwidth commitments property leases b c d total a interest on debt assumes libor is fixed at b amounts exclude certain common area maintenance and other property charges that are not included within the lease payment 
c on february   the company entered into an assignment and assumption agreement with a las vegas based company  whereby this company purchased from us the right to use  square feet in our las vegas data center  along with the infrastructure and equipment associated with this space 
in exchange  we received an initial payment of  and were to receive  per month over two years 
on may   we received full payment of the remaining unpaid balance 
this agreement shifts the responsibility for management of the data center and its employees  along with the maintenance of the facility s infrastructure  to this las vegas based company 
pursuant to this agreement  we have subleased back  square feet of space  allowing us to continue servicing our existing customer base in this market 
commitments related to property leases include an amount related to the  square feet sublease 
d in july  the company entered into a lease agreement for approximately  square feet of data center space in the uk the company has not yet accepted delivery of the data center and therefore the future committed property lease amounts are not reflected 
off balance sheet financing arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases  which are recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  stock based compensation  impairment costs and income taxes 
management reviews its estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experiences  current conditions and future expectations 
the 
table of contents reviews are performed regularly and adjustments are made as required by current available information 
we believe these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
the company derives its revenue from monthly fees for web site and internet application management and hosting  co location services and professional services 
reimbursable expenses charged to customers are included in revenue and cost of revenue 
revenue is recognized as services are performed in accordance with all applicable revenue recognition criteria 
application management  hosting and co location services are billed and recognized as revenue over the term of the contract  generally one to five years  based on actual customer usage 
installation fees associated with application management  hosting and co location services are billed at the time the installation service is provided and recognized as revenue over the term of the related contract 
installation fees generally consist of fees charged to set up a specific technological environment for a customer within a navisite data center 
in instances where payment for a service is received in advance of performing those services  the related revenue is deferred until the period in which such services are performed 
professional services revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis as the services are performed for time and materials type contracts or on a percentage of completion method for fixed price contracts 
the company estimates percentage of completion using the ratio of hours incurred on a contract to the projected hours expected to be incurred to complete the contract 
estimates to complete contracts are prepared by project managers and reviewed by management each month 
when current contract estimates indicate that a loss is probable  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
contract losses are determined as the amount by which the estimated service costs of the contract exceed the estimated revenue that will be generated by the contract 
historically  our estimates have been consistent with actual results 
unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue for services performed that have not been billed 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the applicable revenue recognition criteria are met 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when more than one element such as professional services  installation and hosting services are contained in a single arrangement  the company allocates revenue between the elements based on acceptable fair value allocation methodologies  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the fair value of the undelivered elements is determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately  or in cases when the item is not sold separately  by using other acceptable objective evidence 
management applies judgment to ensure appropriate application of eitf  including the determination of fair value for multiple deliverables  determination of whether undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of delivered elements  and timing of revenue recognition  among others 
for those arrangements where the deliverables do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  revenue from all deliverables are treated as one accounting unit and generally is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
existing customers are subject to initial and ongoing credit evaluations based on credit reviews performed by the company and subsequent to beginning as a customer  payment history and other factors  including the customer s financial condition and general economic trends 
if it is determined subsequent to our initial evaluation at any time during the arrangement that collectability is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized as cash is received as collectability is not considered probable at the time the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform initial and periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and generally do not require collateral or other security against trade receivables 
we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and consider historical bad debts  customer and industry concentrations  customer credit worthiness including the customer s financial performance and their business history  current economic trends and changes in our customers payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we specifically reserve for of the balance of customer accounts deemed uncollectible 
for all other customer accounts  we reserve for of the balance over days old based on invoice date and of all other customer balances 
changes in economic conditions or the financial 
table of contents viability of our customers may result in additional provisions for doubtful accounts in excess of our current estimate 
historically  the company s estimates have been consistent with actual results 
a to unfavorable change in our provision requirements would result in an approximate million to million decrease to income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended july  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review our long lived assets  subject to amortization and depreciation  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
long lived and other intangible assets include customer lists  customer contract backlog  developed technology  vendor contracts  trademarks  non compete agreements and property and equipment 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the use and disposal of the asset are less than its carrying value  and therefore  impaired  the impairment loss recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or values determined by reference to third party valuation reports  depending on the nature of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are valued at the lower of the carrying amount or their fair value less disposal costs 
property and equipment is primarily comprised of leasehold improvements  computer and office equipment and software licenses 
we review the valuation of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or on an interim basis  if it is considered more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
the company s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance 
the company operates in highly competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results 
if our assumption used in preparing our estimates of the company s reporting units projected performance for purposes of impairment testing differs materially from actual future results  the company may record impairment changes in the future and our operating results may be adversely affected 
the company completed its annual impairment review of goodwill as of july  and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
no impairment indicators have arisen since that date to cause us to perform an impairment assessment since that date 
at july  and  the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 
historically  our estimates have been consistent with actual results 
impairment costs 
the company generally records impairments related to underutilized real estate leases 
generally  when it is determined that a facility will no longer be utilized and the facility will generate no future economic benefit  an impairment loss will be recorded in the period such determination is made 
as of july   the company s accrued lease impairment balance totaled approximately million  all of which represents amounts that are committed under remaining contractual obligations 
these contractual obligations principally represent future obligations under non cancelable real estate leases 
impairment estimates relating to real estate leases involve consideration of a number of factors including potential sublet rental rates  estimated vacancy period for the property  brokerage commissions and certain other costs 
estimates relating to potential sublet rates and expected vacancy periods are most likely to have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the event that actual amounts differ significantly from estimates 
these estimates involve judgment and uncertainties  and the settlement of these liabilities could differ materially from recorded amounts 
as such  in the course of making such estimates  management often uses third party real estate professionals to assist management in its assessment of the marketplace for purposes of estimating sublet rates and vacancy periods 
historically  the company s estimates have been consistent with actual results 
a unfavorable settlement of our remaining 
table of contents liabilities for impaired facilities  as compared to our current estimates  would decrease our income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended july  by approximately million to million 
stock based compensation plans on august   the first day of the company s fiscal year  the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases based on estimated fair values 
in march  the sec issued sab no 
relating to sfas no 
r 
the company has applied the provisions of sab no 
in its adoption of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
sfas no 
r supersedes the company s previous accounting under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company measured options  granted prior to august   as compensation cost in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
accordingly  no accounting recognition is given to stock options granted at fair market value until they are exercised 
upon exercise  net proceeds  including tax benefits realized  were credited to equity 
the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of august  in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
r 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period  reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in the company s pro forma information required under sfas no 
for the periods prior to august   the company established estimates for forfeitures 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended july  and included compensation expense for stock based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of july  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas no 
and compensation expense for the stock based payment awards granted subsequent to july  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  the company uses the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model 
in utilizing the black scholes model  the company is required to make certain estimates in order to determine the grant date fair value of equity awards 
these estimates can be complex and subjective and include the expected volatility of the company s common stock  our divided rate  a risk free interest rate  the expected term of the equity award and the expected forfeiture rate of the equity award 
any changes in these assumptions may materially affect the estimated fair value of our recorded stock based compensation 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  using the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
sfas no 
also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this methodology is subjective and requires significant estimates and judgments in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets and in the calculation of certain tax liabilities 
at july  and  respectively  a valuation allowance has been recorded against the gross deferred tax asset since management believes that after considering all the available 
table of contents objective evidence  both positive and negative  historical and prospective  with greater weight given to historical evidence  it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized 
in each reporting period  we evaluate the adequacy of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
in the future  if the company is able to demonstrate a consistent trend of pre tax income then  at that time  management may reduce its valuation allowance accordingly 
the company s federal and state net operating loss carryforwards at july  totaled million 
a reduction in the company s current valuation allowance on these federal and state net operating loss carryforwards would result in an income tax benefit of approximately million for the reporting period 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in several tax jurisdictions 
the company is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  we record estimated reserves for probable exposures 
based on our evaluation of current tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for exposures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
we have not used derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in our investment portfolio or entered into hedging transactions 
however  under our senior secured credit facility we are required to maintain interest rate protection which shall effectively limit the unadjusted variable component of the interest costs of our facility with respect to not less than of the principal amount of all indebtedness  as defined  at a rate that is acceptable to the lending group s agent 
our exposure to market risk associated with risk sensitive instruments entered into for purposes other than trading purposes is not material 
we currently have no significant foreign operations and therefore face no material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our interest rate risk at july  was limited mainly to libor on our outstanding loan under our senior secured credit facility 
at july  we had no open derivative positions with respect to our borrowing arrangements 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the libor rate would have resulted in an approximate million increase in our interest expense under our senior secured credit facility for the fiscal year ended july
