item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in terms of revenue  we are the second largest publicly traded wholesale food distributor in the united states serving the retail grocery industry and the military commissary and exchange systems 
our business consists of three primary operating segments food distribution  military food distribution and retail 
in november  we announced the launch of a new strategic plan  operation fresh start  designed to sharpen our focus and provide a strong platform to support growth initiatives 
built upon extensive knowledge of current industry  consumer and market trends  and formulated to differentiate the company  the new strategy focuses activities on specific retail formats  businesses and support services designed to delight consumers 
the strategic plan encompasses several important elements emphasis on a suite of retail formats designed to appeal to the needs of today s consumers including an initial focus on everyday value  hispanic and extreme value formats  as well as military commissaries and exchanges  strong  passionate businesses in key areas including perishables  health and wellness  center store  pharmacy and military supply  driven by the needs of each format  supply chain services focused on supporting our businesses with warehouse management  inbound and outbound transportation management and customized solutions for each business  retail support services emphasizing best in class offerings in marketing  advertising  merchandising  store design and construction  store brands  market research  retail store support  retail pricing and license agreement opportunities  store brand management dedicated to leveraging the strength of the our family brand as a regional brand through exceptional product development coupled with pricing and marketing support  and integrated shared services company wide  including it support and infrastructure  accounting  finance  human resources and legal 
in fiscal  we stabilized and restored financial vitality to our business 
in addition to the strategic initiatives already in progress  our initiatives consist of the following invest in our retail formats  logistics capabilities and center store systems 
pursue acquisitions that support our strategic plan 
continue share repurchase program up to a total of one million shares 
our food distribution segment sells and distributes a wide variety of nationally branded and private label products to independent grocery stores and other customers primarily in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states 
on march   we completed the purchase from roundy s of the net assets  including customer contracts  of two roundy s wholesale food distribution divisions and two retail stores 
our military segment contracts with manufacturers to distribute a wide variety of grocery products to military commissaries and exchanges located primarily in the mid atlantic region of the united states  and in europe  puerto rico  cuba  the azores and egypt 
we are the largest distributor of grocery products to us military commissaries and exchanges  with over years of experience acting as a distributor to us military commissaries and exchanges 
our retail segment operated corporate owned stores primarily in the upper midwest as of december  primarily due to highly competitive conditions in which supercenters and other alternative formats compete for price conscious customers  we closed or sold nine retail stores in  retail stores in and three retail stores in we are implementing initiatives of varying scope and duration with a view toward improving our response to and performance under these highly competitive conditions 
our strategic initiatives are designed to create value within our organization 
these initiatives include designing 
table of contents and reformatting some of our retail stores into alternative formats to increase overall retail sales performance 
as we continue to assess the impact of performance improvement initiatives and the operating results of individual stores  we may need to recognize additional impairments of long lived assets and additional goodwill impairment associated with our retail segment  and may incur restructuring or other charges in connection with closure or sales activities 
results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal sales the following tables summarize our sales activity for fiscal  and percent percent percent percent percent segment sales sales of sales change sales of sales change sales of sales in millions food distribution military retail total sales the decrease in fiscal food distribution sales versus fiscal was primarily attributable to the loss of a significant customer which accounted for approximately million of the decrease in sales 
sales to our existing customer base also declined slightly relative to fiscal as our existing customers faced increased competition 
the increase in fiscal food distribution sales versus fiscal was due to the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions in the second quarter  which added an estimated million in sales to fiscal as compared to fiscal apart from the impact of the acquisition  sales declined in fiscal due to slower growth in new accounts  customer attrition and decreased sales to our existing customer base 
military segment sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the sales increase is primarily attributable to increased volume and new product line offerings 
the increase in military segment sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of new product line offerings that resulted in new sales volumes domestically 
domestic and overseas sales represented the following percentages of military segment sales domestic overseas the decrease in retail sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable to the closure or sale of three stores during fiscal and stores during fiscal store closures accounted for million of the million decrease in retail sales 
same store sales  which compare retail sales for stores which were in operation for the same number of weeks in the comparative periods  decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decline in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to the closure or sale of nine stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal store closures accounted for million of the million decrease and a decline in same store sales of 
these declines continue to reflect a highly competitive environment in which supercenters and other alternative formats compete for price conscious consumers 

table of contents during fiscal  and  our corporate store count changed as follows fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year number of stores at beginning of year acquired stores closed or sold stores number of stores at end of year store count excludes four corporate owned pharmacies 
gross profit gross profit for fiscal was of sales compared to for fiscal and for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of sales gross profit margin increased in fiscal relative to fiscal as a result of initiatives that focused on better management of inventories and vendor relationships 
however  our overall gross profit margin was negatively affected by of fiscal sales due to a sales mix shift between our business segments 
this was due to a higher percentage of fiscal sales occurring in the military segment and a lower percentage in the retail and food distribution segments which traditionally have had a higher gross profit margin 
the decline in gross profit margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily the result of growth in the food distribution segment coming from lower margin customers 
we estimate that this shift in customer mix toward lower margin food distribution customers decreased our overall gross profit margins by in in addition  our overall gross profit margin was adversely affected due to a higher percentage of sales in the food distribution and military segments as opposed to the retail segment 
the decline in gross profit attributable to this shift in revenues was approximately of sales in fiscal inventory markdown and wind down costs related to retail store closings and retail markdown adjustments are included in cost of sales and were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expense the following table outlines selling  general and administrative expenses sg a and the significant factors affecting sg a of of of sales sales sales in millions except percentages sg a significant factors affecting sg a retail store impairments and lease reserves charges related to food distribution customers gain on sale of assets severance costs tradename impairment vacation standardization total significant factors affecting sg a sg a for fiscal was of sales as compared to of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal a portion of the change in sg a as a percentage of sales in the period is because 
table of contents our retail segment  which has higher sg a than our food distribution and military segments as a percentage of sales  represented a smaller percentage of our total sales in each of these periods 
the decrease in sg a attributable to this shift in revenues was approximately of sales in and of sales in gain on sale of real estate the gain on sale of real estate for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the gain on sale of real estate in all years was primarily related to the sale of unoccupied properties 
special charges in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million related to the closure of retail stores and our intent to seek purchasers for our denver area avanza retail stores 
the charge was reflected in the special charges line within the consolidated statements of income 
in fiscal  we decided to continue to operate the avanza retail stores and therefore recorded a reversal of million of the special charge related to these stores because the assets of the stores were revalued at historical cost less depreciation during the time held for sale 
partially offsetting this reversal was a million change in estimate for other property closure costs 
in fiscal  we recorded million of additional charges  million to write off capitalized lease assets and million to change estimates of lease commitments  related to three properties included in the special charge 
in fiscal  we recorded a reversal of million of previously established lease reserves for one location after subleasing the property earlier than anticipated 
this reversal was partially offset by a charge of million due to revised lease commitment estimates 
goodwill impairment annually  we perform an impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter based on conditions as of the end of our third fiscal quarter in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
no impairment was indicated or recorded in fiscal in fiscal  the test  using an undiscounted operating cash flow assumption  indicated an impairment of our retail segment goodwill 
the resulting analysis of the discounted cash flows of the retail segment indicated an impairment necessitating a charge of million to retail goodwill 
no impairment was indicated or recorded in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal decreased by million  or  as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to reduced capital lease amortization and reduced depreciation on fixtures and equipment 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased by during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower depreciation expense for software  fixtures and equipment and vehicles 
depreciation also reduced as a result of store closings offset by increased depreciation and amortization due to the purchase of the lima and westville divisions 
interest expense interest expense decreased million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in average borrowing levels of million 
average borrowing levels decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal fiscal interest included a payment of million to amend covenants on our senior secured credit facility 
interest expense increased million to million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase was largely due to an increase in our effective interest rate from for fiscal 
table of contents to for fiscal caused by rising interest rates on variable rate debt offset somewhat by the impact of interest rate swaps 
average borrowing levels decreased million from fiscal to fiscal income tax expense the federal statutory rate was for  and the effective tax rate for income from continuing operations in fiscal was compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was impacted by the reversal of previously unrecognized tax benefits of million  primarily due to statute of limitation expirations  audit resolutions  and the filing of reports with various taxing authorities which resulted in the settlement of uncertain tax positions 
during fiscal year we increased tax reserves by million 
during fiscal  we reversed previously established income tax reserves of million primarily due to the resolution of various federal and state tax issues and statute of limitation expirations 
refer to the tax rate table in part ii  item of this report under note income taxes of notes to the consolidated financial statements for the comparative components of these rates

we expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and enable us to reduce our debt  with temporary draws on our revolving credit line needed during the year to build inventories for certain holidays 
longer term  we believe that cash flows from operations  short term bank borrowings  various types of long term debt and lease and equity financing will be adequate to meet our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations 
the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for fiscal  and and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of cash flows in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents operating cash flows were million for fiscal  a decrease of million from million in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease in operating cash flows for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to increases in accounts and notes receivable million and inventories  net of the lifo charge million 
the increase in accounts and notes receivable primarily related to the timing of payments made by our military segment customers 
the increase in inventories reflects our desire to capitalize on inventory management opportunities 
operating cash flows were million for fiscal  an increase of million from million for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in operating cash flows for fiscal as compared to fiscal was a decrease of million in inventories during fiscal as compared to an increase of million in inventories in fiscal the decrease in fiscal inventories was due to progress made in our distribution business rationalization and the integration of the lima and westville distribution centers acquired from roundy s  decreased retail inventories as a result of the sale or closure of stores in fiscal and increased focus on managing inventory levels 
cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash was primarily used for additions of property  plant and equipment 
cash used for investing activities in fiscal included million for the purchase of the westville and lima divisions from roundy s 
cash used by financing activities was million for fiscal as million was used to pay down the revolving debt and other long term debt  million was used to repurchase shares of our common stock and million was used to pay dividends on our common stock 
cash used by financing activities was million for fiscal as million was used to pay down the revolving debt and other long term debt and million was used to pay dividends on our common stock 
financing activities for fiscal primarily included proceeds from the private placement of million in convertible notes and net receipts from revolving debt of million to finance the acquisition of the westville and lima divisions 
credit availability under the senior secured credit facility was million as of december  share repurchase on november   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program to purchase up to one million shares of the company s common stock 
the program took effect on november   and will continue until the earlier of the close of trading on january  or the date that the aggregate purchases under the repurchase program reaches  shares of our common stock 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased  shares at an average price per share of including commissions

interest payments assume debt is held to maturity 
for variable rate debt the current interest rates applicable as of december   were assumed for the remainder of the term 
lease obligations primarily relate to store locations for our retail segment  as well as store locations subleased to independent food distribution customers 
a discussion of lease commitments can be found in part ii  item in this report under note leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements and under the caption lease commitments in the critical accounting policies section below

the amount of purchase obligations shown in the table represents the amount of product we are contractually obligated to purchase 
the majority of our purchase obligations involve purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business  which are not included in the table above 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within very short time horizons 
the purchase obligations shown in this table also exclude agreements that are cancelable by us without significant penalty  which include contracts for routine outsourced services 
we have also made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond these commitments include standby letters of credit and guarantees of certain food distribution customer debt and lease obligations

senior secured credit facility our senior secured credit facility consists of million in revolving credit  all of which may be used for loans and up to million of which may be used for letters of credit  and a million term loan b 
the term loan b portion of the facility was million as of december   of which million was permanently paid down during fiscal borrowings under the facility bear interest at either the eurodollar rate or the prime rate  plus a margin spread that is dependent on our total leverage ratio 
we pay a commitment commission on the unused portion of the revolver 
the margin spreads and the commitment commission are reset quarterly based on changes to our total leverage ratio defined by the applicable credit agreement 
at december  and december   the margin spreads for the 
table of contents revolver and term loan b maintained as eurodollar loans were and  respectively  and the commitment commission was 
the margin spread for the revolver maintained at the prime rate was 
we expect each of the margin spreads to decrease by basis points in the first quarter of fiscal based on the total leverage ratio at the end of fiscal at december   credit availability under the senior secured credit facility was million 
on february   we entered into a first amendment to our credit facility permitting us to enter into the asset purchase agreement with roundy s and to close and finance the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions 
on november   we entered into a second amendment to our credit facility which changed the existing total leverage ratio covenant and increased the margin spread whenever the total leverage ratio covenant exceeds to 
our senior secured credit facility represents one of our primary sources of liquidity  both short term and long term  and the continued availability of credit under that facility is of material importance to our ability to fund our capital and working capital needs 
the credit agreement governing the credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  compliance with which is essential to continued credit availability 
among the most significant of these restrictive covenants are financial covenants which require us to maintain predetermined ratio levels related to interest coverage and leverage 
these ratios are based on ebitda  on a rolling four quarter basis  with some adjustments consolidated ebitda 
consolidated ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is defined in our bank credit agreement as earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted to exclude extraordinary gains or losses  gains or losses from sales of assets other than inventory in the ordinary course of business  upfront fees and expenses incurred in connection with the execution and delivery of the credit agreement  and non cash charges such as lifo charges  closed store lease costs  asset impairments and share based compensation  less cash payments made during the current period on certain non cash charges recorded in prior periods 
in addition  for purposes of determining compliance with prescribed leverage ratios and adjustments in the credit facility s margin spread and commitment commission  consolidated ebitda is calculated on a pro forma basis that takes into account all permitted acquisitions  such as the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions  that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant four quarter computation period 
consolidated ebitda should not be considered an alternative measure of our net income  operating performance  cash flow or liquidity 
it is provided as additional information relative to compliance with our debt covenants 
in addition  the credit agreement requires us to maintain predetermined ratio levels related to working capital coverage the ratio of the sum of net trade accounts receivable plus inventory to the sum of loans and letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement plus up to million of additional secured indebtedness permitted to be issued under the credit agreement 
the financial covenants specified in the credit agreement  as amended  vary over the term of the credit agreement and can be summarized as follows for the fiscal periods ending financial covenants closest to required ratio interest coverage ratio through minimum thereafter total leverage ratio through maximum through thereafter senior secured leverage ratio through maximum thereafter working capital ratio through minimum thereafter 
table of contents as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants as defined in our credit agreement which are summarized as follows financial covenant required ratio actual ratio interest coverage ratio minimum total leverage ratio maximum senior secured leverage ratio maximum working capital ratio minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters to interest expense less deferred financing costs on the current agreement for such period 
total outstanding debt to consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters 
total outstanding senior secured debt to consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters 
ratio of net trade accounts receivable plus inventory to the sum of loans and letters of credit outstanding under the new credit agreement plus certain additional secured debt 
any failure to comply with any of these financial covenants would constitute an event of default under the bank credit agreement  entitling a majority of the bank lenders to  among other things  terminate future credit availability under the agreement and accelerate the maturity of outstanding obligations under that agreement

convertible subordinated debt on march   we completed a private placement of million in aggregate issue price or million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior subordinated convertible notes due the funds were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions from roundy s 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and rank junior to our existing and future senior indebtedness  including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
cash interest at the rate of per year is payable semi annually on the issue price of the notes until march  after that date  cash interest will not be payable  unless contingent cash interest becomes 
table of contents payable  and original issue discount for non tax purposes will accrue on the notes at a daily rate of per year until the maturity date of the notes 
on the maturity date of the notes  a holder will receive  per note 
contingent cash interest will be paid on the notes during any six month period  commencing march   if the average market price of a note for a ten trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals or more of the accreted principal amount of the note  plus accrued cash interest  if any 
the contingent cash interest payable with respect to any six month period will equal an annual rate of of the average market price of the note for the ten trading day measurement period described above 
the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder  only upon the occurrence of certain events  at an adjusted conversion rate of shares initially shares of our common stock per  principal amount at maturity of notes equal to an adjusted conversion price of approximately per share 
upon conversion  we will pay the holder the conversion value in cash up to the accreted principal amount of the note and the excess conversion value  if any  in cash  stock or a combination of both  at our option 
we may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after the eighth anniversary of the issuance of the notes 
holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes on the th  th  th  th and th anniversaries of the issuance of the notes 
in addition  upon specified change in control events  each holder will have the option  subject to certain limitations  to require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of such holder s notes 
in connection with the closing of the sale of the notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the notes 
in accordance with that agreement  we filed with the securities and exchange commission on july   a shelf registration statement covering the resale by security holders of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
the shelf registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on october  our contractual obligation  however  to maintain the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement has expired 
as a result  we removed from registration  by means of a post effective amendment filed on july   all notes and common stock that remained unsold at such time 
debt obligations for debt obligations  the following table presents principal cash flows  related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and fair value as of december  fixed rate variable rate fair value amount rate fair value amount rate in thousands thereafter derivative instruments we have market risk exposure to changing interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities and commodity price risk associated with anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
to achieve these objectives  we use derivative instruments  primarily interest rate and commodity swap agreements  to manage risk exposures when appropriate  based on market conditions 
we do not enter into derivative agreements for trading or other speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument 

table of contents interest rate swap agreements are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december   expired in fiscal and  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas the fair value gains reported in other comprehensive income were reclassified into income as they expired 
interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december   and their fair values are summarized as follows december  in thousands  except percentages notional amount pay fixed receive variable fair value asset average receive rate for effective swaps average pay rate for effective swaps the company uses commodity swap agreements to reduce price risk associated with anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
the agreements call for an exchange of payments with the company making payments based on fixed prices per gallon and receiving payments based on floating prices  without an exchange of the underlying commodity amount upon which the payments are based 
at december   the company had no outstanding commodity swap agreements 
at december   our one outstanding commodity swap agreement was not considered effective in accordance with sfas as such  pre tax gains of million on the commodity swap agreement were recorded as a reduction to cost of sales during fiscal the commodity swap agreement commenced and will expire as follows notional effective date termination date fixed rate  gallons month gallon in addition to the previously discussed interest rate and commodity swap agreements  we entered into a fixed price fuel supply agreement in the first quarter of to support our food distribution segment 
the agreement requires us to purchase a total of  gallons of diesel fuel per month at prices ranging from to per gallon 
the term of the agreement began on february   and expired on december  the fixed price fuel agreement qualifies for the normal purchase exception under sfas  therefore the fuel purchases under this contract are expensed as incurred as an increase to cost of sales 
off balance sheet arrangements as of the date of this report  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to 
table of contents occur periodically  could materially impact our financial statements 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical and could result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions customer exposure and credit risk allowance for doubtful accounts methodology 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in most circumstances when we become aware of factors that may indicate a deterioration in a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  reductions of product purchases  deteriorating store conditions  changes in payment patterns  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
in determining the adequacy of the reserves  we analyze factors such as the value of any collateral  customer financial statements  historical collection experience  aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the collectability based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
if circumstances change ie  further evidence of material adverse creditworthiness  additional accounts become credit risks  store closures  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount  including to zero 
lease commitments 
we have historically leased store sites for sublease to qualified independent retailers at rates that are at least as high as the rent paid by us 
under terms of the original lease agreements  we remain primarily liable for any commitments an independent retailer may no longer be financially able to satisfy 
we also lease store sites for our retail segment 
should a retailer be unable to perform under a sublease or should we close underperforming corporate stores  we record a charge to earnings for costs of the remaining term of the lease  less any anticipated sublease income 
calculating the estimated losses requires that significant estimates and judgments be made by management 
our reserves for such properties can be materially affected by factors such as the extent of interested sub lessees and their creditworthiness  our ability to negotiate early termination agreements with lessors  general economic conditions and the demand for commercial property 
should the number of defaults by sub lessees or corporate store closures materially increase  the remaining lease commitments we must record could have a material adverse effect on operating results and cash flows 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of lease commitments 
guarantees of debt and lease obligations of others 
we have guaranteed the debt and lease obligations of certain food distribution customers 
in the event these retailers are unable to meet their debt service payments or otherwise experience an event of default  we would be unconditionally liable for the outstanding balance of their debt and lease obligations million as of december   which would be due in accordance with the underlying agreements 
during fiscal  we entered into a new guarantee with a food distribution customer that is accounted for under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin provides that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the maximum undiscounted payments we would be required to make in the event of default under the guarantee is million  which is included in the million total referenced above 
the maximum amount of the guarantee is reduced annually during the approximate five year term of the agreement and is secured by a personal guarantee from the affiliated customer 
the initial liability was recorded at fair value and is immaterial to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
all of the other guarantees were issued prior to december   and therefore are not subject to the recognition and measurement provisions of fin we have also assigned various leases to certain food distribution customers and other third parties 
if the assignees were to become unable to continue making payments under the assigned leases  we estimate our maximum potential obligation with respect to the assigned leases  net of reserves  to be approximately million as of december  in circumstances when we become aware of factors that indicate deterioration in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations guaranteed or assigned by us  we record a 
table of contents specific reserve in the amount we reasonably believe we will be obligated to pay on the customer s behalf  net of any anticipated recoveries from the customer 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we analyze factors such as those described above in allowance for doubtful accounts methodology and lease commitments 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the obligations based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on operating results and cash flows 
triggering these guarantees or obligations under assigned leases would not  however  result in cross default of our debt  but could restrict resources available for general business initiatives 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note concentration of credit risk in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding customer exposure and credit risk 
impairment of long lived assets property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
estimates of future results are often influenced by assessments of changes in competition  merchandising strategies  human resources and general market conditions  which may result in not recognizing an impairment loss 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we generally determine fair value by discounting expected future cash flows at the rate we utilize to evaluate potential investments 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation of future results could be materially affected by different judgments as to competition  strategies and market conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on financial condition and operating results 
goodwill goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  annually and or when factors indicating impairment are present 
fair value is determined primarily based on valuation studies performed by us  which utilize a discounted cash flow methodology 
valuation analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made by management 
our estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as competitive forces  customer behaviors  changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on financial condition and operating results and impairment of the goodwill 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our results of operations  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 

table of contents we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for income taxes sfas 
under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse or are settled 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions could be challenged and we may ultimately not prevail in defending our positions 
these reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the expiration of statutes of limitations 
the effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as  related penalties and interest 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by taxing authorities 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin on december  fin provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we did not recognize any adjustment in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  as a result of fin  that impacted the december   balance of retained earnings 
prior to fiscal we determined our tax contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we recorded estimated tax liabilities to the extent the contingencies were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
reserves for self insurance we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  general and automobile liability and health insurance costs 
it is our policy to record our self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
worker s compensation  general and automobile liabilities are actuarially determined on a discounted basis 
we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  general and automobile and health insurance liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  such changes could have a material impact on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
a basis point change in discount rates would increase our liability by approximately million 
vendor allowances and credits as is common in our industry  we use a third party service to undertake accounts payable audits on an ongoing basis 
these audits examine vendor allowances offered to us during a given year as well as cash discounts  freight allowances and duplicate payments and establish a basis for us to recover overpayments made to vendors 
we reduce future payments to vendors based on the results of these audits  at which time we also establish reserves for commissions payable to the third party service provider as well as for amounts that may not be collected 
we also establish reserves for future repayments to vendors for disputed payment deductions related to accounts payable audits  promotional allowances and other items 
although our estimates of reserves do not anticipate changes in our historical payback rates  such changes could have a material impact on our currently recorded reserves 

table of contents share based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment revised  sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
beginning in  our results of operations reflect compensation expense for newly issued stock options and other forms of share based compensation granted under our stock incentive plans  for the unvested portion of previously issued stock options and other forms of share based compensation granted  and for our employee stock purchase plan 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant 
the company uses the grant date closing price per share of nash finch common stock to estimate the fair value of restricted stock units rsus and performance units granted pursuant to its long term incentive plan ltip 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options 
the value of the portion of the awards ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
share based compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ materially from those estimates 
significant judgment is required in selecting the assumptions used for estimating fair value of share based compensation as well estimating forfeiture rates 
further  any awards with performance conditions that can affect vesting also add additional judgment in determining the amount expected to vest 
there can be significant volatility in many of our assumptions and therefore our estimates of fair value  forfeitures  etc 
are sensitive to changes in these assumptions 
new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about instruments recorded at fair value 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements

in july  the fasb released a proposed fasb staff position fsp apb a  accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants that would alter the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments that allow for either mandatory or optional cash settlements  which would impact the accounting associated with the company s existing million senior convertible notes 
if adopted as currently proposed  this proposal would require the company to recognize non cash interest expense based on the market rate for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature 
furthermore  it would require recognizing interest expense in prior periods pursuant to retrospective accounting treatment 
it is expected that the fasb will issue final guidance during fiscal and such guidance would be effective beginning in fiscal the company is monitoring the developments of this proposal and is evaluating the potential impact it will have on its financial statements  which could be significant
