item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes under item of this report 
overview the combined effects of the critical issues involving the mortgage market nationally  michigan s economic conditions including a decline in michigan s residential real estate values along with the third highest rate of unemployment in the nation  are some of the many the reasons the bank saw marked increases in nonperforming loans during michigan s unemployment is currently above  st 
clair county s unemployment stands at and local unemployment in port huron is 
as a result  the company substantially increased its provision for loan losses thereby decreasing net income 
the company also reported that the united states treasury department awarded the port huron cde  community development entity  llc million in tax credits to stimulate economic and community development jobs through the treasury department s new market tax credit nmtc program 
the port huron cde is a limited liability company under citizens first savings bank 
the port huron cde will use the million to revitalize downtown port huron in order to reduce high rates of vacancy and unemployment 
the company  through the port huron cde  will target real estate and business investments with a focus on healthcare  industrial  mixed use projects and shared community facilities 
the port huron cde was the only michigan cde to receive a nmtc award in the company currently operates as a community oriented financial institution that accepts deposits from the general public in the communities surrounding its full service banking centers and loan production office 
the deposited funds  together with funds generated from operations and borrowings  are used by the company to originate loans 
the company s principal lending activity is the origination of mortgage loans for the purchase or refinancing of one to four family residential properties 
the company also originates commercial and multi family real estate loans  construction loans  commercial loans  automobile loans  home equity loans and lines of credit and a variety of other consumer loans 
critical accounting policies management has established various accounting policies that govern how accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america are used to prepare the company s financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
certain accounting policies require 
table of contents management to make estimates and assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and as to which different estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the carrying value of certain of the company s assets and liabilities  on the company s net income and on the company s overall financial condition and results of operations 
the estimates and assumptions management uses are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly as a result of these estimates and assumptions  and different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain of the company s assets and liabilities  on the company s net income and on the company s overall financial condition and results of operations for future reporting periods 
management believes that the company s critical accounting policies relate to the company s securities  allowance for loan losses  its valuation of its mortgage servicing rights and goodwill and intangibles 
these policies are described in more detail below 
securities 
securities are evaluated to determine whether a decline in their value below amortized cost is other than temporary 
management and the asset liability committee systematically evaluate securities for other than temporary declines in market value on a quarterly basis 
management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  trends of the respective indices  historical rate patterns and their relation to the expected rates  in addition to the reasons underlying the decline  to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent 
it indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable 
once a decline in value below amortized cost is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced to its fair value  forming a new cost basis for the investment  and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
for additional information about the securities  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
allowance for loan losses 
the company recognizes that losses will be experienced from originating loans and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other factors  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan 
to reflect the perceived risk associated with the company s loan portfolio  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb potential losses from loans in its loan portfolio 
as losses are estimated to have occurred  management establishes a provision for loan losses  which is charged directly against earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is assured 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
in general the company reviews the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis and establishes a provision based on actual and estimated losses inherent in the portfolio 
potential significant impact on financial statements and condition 
the level of the allowance for loan losses is important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  the determination of what the loan allowance should be requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments about which estimates and assumptions to use  and no assurances can be given that the company s level of allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover future loan losses incurred by the company 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions  resulting in a direct impact on the company s allowance for loan losses and requiring changes in the allowance 
nevertheless  management believes that  based on information currently available  the company s allowance for loan losses is sufficient to cover losses inherent in its loan portfolio at this time 
however  because the estimates and assumptions underlying the company s allowance for loan losses are inherently uncertain  different estimates and assumptions could require a material increase in the allowance for loan losses 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on the company s net income  its financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information about the allowance for loan losses  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
the company routinely sells its originated residential mortgage loans to investors  mainly freddie mac and fannie mae 
although the company sells the mortgage loans  it frequently retains the servicing rights  or the rights to collect payments and otherwise service these loans  for an administrative or servicing fee 
the mortgage loans that the company services for others are not included as assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
loans serviced for others were approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company s mortgage servicing rights relating to loans serviced for others represent an asset of the company 
this asset is initially capitalized and included in other assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the mortgage servicing rights are then amortized against noninterest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying mortgage servicing rights 
there are a number of factors  however  that can affect the ultimate value of the mortgage servicing rights to the company  including the estimated prepayment speed of the loan and the discount rate used to present value the servicing right 
for example  if the mortgage loan is prepaid  the company will receive fewer servicing fees  meaning that the present value of the mortgage servicing rights is less than the carrying value of those rights on the company s balance sheet 
therefore  in an 
table of contents attempt to reflect an accurate expected value to the company of the mortgage servicing rights  the company receives a valuation of its mortgage servicing rights from an independent third party 
the independent third party s valuation of the mortgage servicing rights is based on relevant characteristics of the company s loan servicing portfolio  such as loan terms  interest rates and recent prepayment experience  as well as current market interest rate levels  market forecasts and other economic conditions 
based upon the independent third party s valuation of the company s mortgage servicing rights  management then establishes a valuation allowance by each strata  if necessary  to quantify the likely impairment of the value of the mortgage servicing rights to the company 
the estimates of prepayment speeds and discount rates are inherently uncertain  and different estimates could have a material impact on the company s net income and results of operations 
the valuation allowance is evaluated and adjusted quarterly by management to reflect changes in the fair value of the underlying mortgage servicing rights based on market conditions 
the balances of the company s capitalized mortgage servicing rights  net of valuation allowance  included in the company s other assets at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
the fair values of the company s mortgage servicing rights were determined using annual constant prepayment speeds of and  respectively  and discount rates of and at december  and december  constant prepayment speeds are a statistical measure of the historical or expected prepayment of principal on a mortgage 
different estimates of the prepayment speeds and discount rates or different assumptions could have a material impact on the value of the mortgage servicing rights and  therefore  on the company s valuation allowance 
for further discussion of the company s valuation allowance and valuation of mortgage servicing rights  including a table setting forth the valuation allowances established by management with regard to the company s mortgage servicing rights for the previous three periods  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
goodwill and other intangibles assets 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
the company s goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking business and the value is dependent upon the company s ability to provide quality  cost effective services in a competitive market place 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is generated by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
for a further discussion of the company s goodwill and intangibles  please refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
comparison of financial condition at december  and total assets 
total assets increased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december   primarily due to a million  or  increase in allowance for loan loss  a million  or  increase in accrued interest receivable and other assets which includes a million purchase of bank owned life insurance  a million  or  increase in federal home loan bank fhlb stock  due to increased borrowings from the fhlb which  in turn  required an increased investment in fhlb stock and a million  or  increase in securities 
the increases in assets at december   as compared to assets at december   described above were partially offset by a decrease in loans of approximately million  or  which is explained in more detail below 
the company s net loans to assets ratio at december  was compared to at december   as a result of the million decrease in net loans 
the decrease in loans was a result of the company s operating strategy of controlled balance sheet growth along with the general slowdown in the overall economy and consisted primarily of a million  or  decrease in one to four family loans to million and a million  or  decrease in construction loans to million 
the decrease in one to four family loans was primarily due to mortgage loan securitization by the company of approximately million of fixed and variable rate mortgage loans 
the decrease in construction loans was primarily due to these loans completing the construction phase and transferring to one to four family loans 
we expect the activity in these types of loans to remain flat or decrease slightly during as a result of the current rate environment and the general economic conditions in the state of michigan 

table of contents total liabilities 
total liabilities increased million  or  from billion at december  to billion at december  the increase was primarily due to the following a million  or  increase in deposits from billion at december  to billion at december  and a net increase of million  or  in total net borrowings 
the overall increase in deposits was primarily invested in investment securities 
the increase in deposits is discussed in detail below 
while our deposits have grown during  we expect continued intense competition for deposit share in our macomb and oakland county markets 
as part of our strategic plan  we believe we have a tremendous amount of opportunity to increase the number of products per household 
the million increase in deposits at december  compared to december  was primarily due to the following a million  or  increase in certificates of deposit and  was partially offset by a decrease in non interest bearing deposits of million  or  a decrease of now deposits of million  or and a decrease of money market deposits of million  or 
the increases in the certificates of deposit accounts were primarily due to an increase of million  or in brokered deposits 
these deposits have an average rate of and an average life of years and are callable at the option of the bank generally after months 
the increase in brokered deposits was offset by a decrease of million  or of retail certificates of deposits 
the company approaches these types of customers with a disciplined focus on rates  service and quality of our products and thus allowed the customers accounts to mature without renewal 
the increase in deposits at december   as compared to december   was partially offset by a decrease in money market deposits of million  or primarily due to customers transferring deposits to higher earning certificate of deposit accounts 
the company also experienced a decrease in non interest bearing deposits and now deposits due to the customers withdrawing the funds for general purposes 
quality of assets 
the company ceases accruing interest on residential mortgages secured by real estate and consumer loans when principal or interest payments are delinquent days or more 
commercial loans that are days or more past due are reviewed by the senior vice president of commercial banking  the loan officer and the special asset team to determine whether they will be classified as nonperforming 
these officers review various factors which include  but are not limited to  the timing of the maturity of the loan in relation to the ability to collect  whether the loan is deemed to be well secured  whether the loan is in the process of collection  and the favorable results of the analysis of customer financial data 
a nonperforming loan will only be re classified as a performing loan once the loan becomes current 

table of contents the following table provides information at the dates indicated regarding nonperforming loans in the company s loan portfolio and real estate and other assets owned in thousands at december  nonperforming loans real estate commercial consumer total real estate and other assets owned total nonperforming assets total nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans total nonperforming loans as a percentage of total assets the increase at december  from reflects the change in policy for nonperforming loans to be classified as performing as discussed in our form k filing for the fiscal year ended december  the increase at december  in the commercial loan portfolio reflects certain commercial loan relationships that were previously classified as watch credits by management at december  these loan relationships have either deteriorated or have been placed under forbearance agreements by management 
the company believes that the collateral attached to these relationships is adequate or that specific reserves have been allocated to cover any potential impairment 
the following table sets forth loans days past due and accruing interest in thousands at december  real estate loans one to four family commercial and multi family residential construction home equity and lines of credit commercial loans consumer loans total accruing loans days past due to total loans interest income that would have been recorded for the year ended december   had nonperforming loans performed according to their original terms amounted to approximately  interest income related to these loans included in interest income for the year ended december   was approximately  nonperforming loans were of total loans at december   compared to at december  nonperforming loans increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increases in the real estate  consumer and nonperforming assets categories at december  are primarily due to an overall weakening of economic conditions experienced in the state of michigan 
the company believes that it has adequate collateral  along with procedures in place to mitigate the risk of a declining market 
based on management s analysis of its nonperforming loan portfolio  there are no large loan relationships with any one borrower that would lead management to assess nonperforming loans differently 
see the loans section of note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report for more information 

table of contents nonperforming assets  which includes nonperforming loans and real estate and other assets owned by the company after foreclosure  increased million  or  to million  or  of total assets  at december   as compared to million  or  of total assets at december  this increase in nonperforming assets was due to the increase in nonperforming loans as described above along with an increase of million in real estate and other assets owned 
the allowance for loan losses increased to million at december   or  of total loans and of nonperforming loans at december   as compared to million  or of total loans and of nonperforming loans at december  the upward trend in the allowance for loan losses to total loans is a result of the additional provision expense during the year and the downward trend in the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans is a result of the increase in nonperforming loans relative to increase in the allowance for loan losses 
net charge offs increased from million to million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
these assets are regularly monitored  have been under the management of our experienced special asset team and have workout plans which are in place to mitigate any potential losses 
the company s allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain 
use of a different amount or assumptions for the allowance could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
for more information on how the amount of this allowance is determined  please see the caption critical accounting policies in this section

the decrease in net income for was primarily due to a million  or  increase in the provision for loan losses as a result of the weakening economy 
net interest income after the provision for loan losses decreased million  or 
the decrease in net interest income after the provision for loan losses was offset by an increase of million  or  increase in noninterest income  which was primarily due to a  or  increase in service charges and other fees 
these increases and decreases are explained in more detail below 
net interest income 
net interest income  before provision for loan loss  decreased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to prime rate decreases  or basis points  between december  and december  as such  total interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the current falling interest rate environment and the increase in nonperforming loans generated lower yields in both loans and investments 
however  volume growth in loans  primarily mortgage loans  contributed to the rise in interest income 
the increase in interest income was offset by a million  or  increase in interest expense  primarily due to our increased offering rates on interest bearing deposit accounts 
similarly to  our loan growth surpassed our growth in deposits during and therefore  as anticipated  our borrowings increased to fund this loan growth 
we expect this trend to continue throughout based on our expectations of growth and the competitive markets in which the company operates or anticipates operating 
interest 
table of contents expense on deposits increased million  or  from million to million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
a majority of this increase was in savings deposits and certificate of deposit accounts  as previously discussed above 
as we continue to move into new markets to expand our market share  we expect interest expense on deposits to increase during  as experienced during the year ended december  the company is entering highly competitive markets  however  based on management s analysis  we believe that these markets provide greater and more lucrative opportunities within which to execute our strategic plan 
we believe the macomb  lapeer and oakland county markets are experiencing positive economic growth based on census data 
our net interest margin fell by basis points from to from december  to december   respectively  primarily due to the increase in the yield paid for interest bearing liabilities outpacing the increase in yield earned for interest earning assets 
provision for loan losses 
the provisions for loan losses for december  and december  were million and million respectively  or an increase of 
the provision for loan losses is thoroughly reviewed and is the result of management s analysis of the loan loss allowance  current and forecasted economic conditions in the regional markets where we conduct business and historical charge off rates in the overall loan portfolio 
in order to accurately depict the actual loss inherent in a loan relationship  a determination is made by reviewing a non performing loan for collateral sufficiency 
this entails utilizing any relevant appraisal values and discounting said values for market deterioration  time value of liquidation period  and liquidation costs 
standard discount factors are applied to maintain consistency and reflect current market and economic conditions 
the resulting discounted values are reviewed  and adjusted if necessary  every six months 
those factors are for liquidation expense broker commission and other and a selling period of years for builder direct speculative homes and years for vacant land  discounted at current interest rates 
these factors are consistent with best estimates of current market conditions and within acceptable regulatory parameters 
the provision for loan losses increased by million for the year ended december  compared to december  as a result of an increase in nonperforming loans from of the total loan portfolio to 
the combined effects of the critical issues involving the mortgage market nationally  michigan s economic conditions including a decline in michigan s residential real estate values along with the third highest rate of unemployment in the nation  impacted the company s performance in the third and fourth quarters and are the reasons for the increase in our nonperforming loans 
michigan s unemployment is currently above  st 
clair county s unemployment stands at and local unemployment in port huron is 
with respect to these factors  an additional provision was recorded to strengthen the allowance for potential loan losses  thereby increasing the allowance from 
of total loans to of total loans based upon our detailed analysis of the allowance for loan losses performed at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans decreased from at december  to at december  as a result of the increase in nonperforming loans compared to the increase in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan loss analysis includes potential losses in the loan portfolio which could be realized depending on future changes in market conditions 
based on our analysis  we believe that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to cover potential losses at december  the company has never participated in  nor does the company carry  any sub prime residential mortgages or securities backed by these loans on its books 
in the construction and development portfolio of approximately million  or of total loans  the company has four residential builders with high quality developments  known as builder direct loans that have experienced sales well below previous expectations 
the company s residential mortgages and builder direct loans were valued properly at the time of origination in accordance with the company s conservative loan policies 
in  the company significantly reduced new investments in the builder direct portion of the construction and development portfolio 
the builder direct portion of that portfolio is equal to of the total loan portfolio 
for the purpose of reducing our concentration of risk  the company plans to reduce overall investment in the construction and development portfolio to less than of total capital 
the company has implemented creative and aggressive programs in the residential mortgage and construction and development portfolios designed to limit our credit risk and to assist our customers that have been affected by the economic conditions in michigan and who face the potential of losing their home without the assistance of the company 
management considers its allowance for loan losses to be one of its critical accounting policies 
management reviews the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis and establishes a provision based on actual and estimated losses in the portfolio 
because the estimates and assumptions underlying the company s allowance for loan losses are uncertain  different estimates and assumptions could require a material increase in the allowance for loan losses 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses could also have a material adverse effect on the company s net income and results of operations

as discussed in previous sec quarterly and annual reports  the company s noninterest income is an area that continues to be on the forefront of management discussion and efforts to improve are constantly reviewed 
this is an area that  compared to our peers  provides a tremendous opportunity for growth 
however  it is recognized by management that exemplary execution is vital to our success 
service charges and other fees increased by  or  from million to million during the years end december  and december  the increase in service charges and other fees is a result of our efforts to enhance our available products to customers and revising our service charges on value added products over the last several months

noninterest expense increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to an increase of million  or in office occupancy costs 
this increase was primarily due to a  increase in depreciation expense for software and buildings and a  increase in service agreements on furniture  fixtures and equipment 
professional fees increased  or  primarily due to a  increase in legal fees due to increased issues in delinquent and nonperforming loans and due to the lawsuit filed by citizens banking corporation 
this lawsuit is discussed in item legal proceedings 
these increases were offset by a decrease of  in compensation  a decrease of  in printing and supplies and a  decrease in data processing expenses 
income taxes 
federal income taxes for the year ended december  were  a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of a level amount of nontaxable interest income representing a larger portion of income tax expense in due to lower earnings

the increase in net income was offset by an increase of million  or  increase in noninterest expenses  which was primarily due to a million  or  increase in compensation and employee benefits 
these increases and decreases are explained in more detail below 
net interest income 
net interest income  before provision for loan loss  increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to prime rate increases  or basis points  between december  and december  as such  total interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the current rising interest rate environment generated higher yields in both loans and investments 
however  our growth in loans  primarily mortgage loans  contributed to the rise in interest income 
the increase in interest income was offset by a million  or  increase in interest expense  primarily due to our increased offering rates on interest bearing deposit accounts 
similarly to  our loan growth surpassed our growth in deposits during and therefore  as anticipated  our borrowings increased to fund this loan growth

provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses increased  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increased provision for loan losses is a result of our analysis of the allowance for loan losses  loan growth and the increase in nonperforming loans during despite the increased provision  the loan loss allowance as a percentage of total loans decreased from at december  to at december  see the quality of assets section above for additional discussion relating to the provision for loan losses 
management expects  based on our strategic plan  that the provision for loan losses during will increase by approximately  if not more than  the increase experienced during 
table of contents noninterest income 
as discussed in previous sec quarterly and annual reports  the company s noninterest income is an area that continues to be on the forefront of management discussion and efforts to improve are constantly reviewed 
this is an area that  compared to our peers  provides a tremendous opportunity for growth 
however  it is recognized by management that exemplary execution is vital to our success 
more recently  management has completed an analysis of our noninterest income sources and expects to implement the results thereof during the first quarter of service charges and other fees remained relatively flat  however  mortgage banking activities decreased by  or  from million to million during the years ended december  and december   respectively  primarily due to recognition of approximately  of gains related to a million loan sale during the increase in mortgage banking activities without the million loan sale in was  or  for the twelve months ended december  trust fee income increased by  or  from million to million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to an increase of million  or  in compensation  payroll taxes and employee benefit expenses  due primarily to full and part time employees added during to increase the level of customer service and to accommodate the expansion of our branch and loan production office network 
given the rise in healthcare costs  growth expected to be achieved in the future  and the costs of securing experienced personnel  we expect these expenses to continue to increase in the future 
we have invested significantly in experienced personnel to generate various efficiencies and to obtain the overall growth that we experienced in we expect these investments in personnel to continue to add value to our business model 
in addition to the increase in compensation  payroll taxes and employee benefit expenses  office occupancy and equipment increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to a loan production office which was converted to a full service branch and a new loan production office in florida  as rent expense increased during the company also renovated the retail branch located in the main office to enhance its aesthetic appearance and service environment 
increases in noninterest expense are expected to increase slightly over the next year  primarily due to increases in the costs of healthcare benefits for our employees 
income taxes 
federal income taxes for the year ended december  were million  an increase of  or  from million for the year ended december  the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
included in federal income taxes at december   was a reserve for the realization of the company s contribution carryforward for tax purposes  which expired in fiscal as noted in  management determined  based on projected taxable income levels through  that the entire amount of the contribution carryforward would not be utilized 
liquidity and capital resources general 
liquidity is the company s ability to meet its current and future needs for cash 
the company further defines liquidity as the ability to have funds available  without incurring excessive cost  to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to satisfy its financial commitments  as well as continued flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities 
many factors affect a company s ability to meet its liquidity needs  including variation in the markets served  the company s asset liability mix  its reputation and credit standing in the market and general economic conditions 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term responsibility of management 
the company adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning assets and costs of interest bearing liabilities  and the objectives of its asset liability management program  which are to balance and control the risks and financial position of the company 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning overnight deposits and short and intermediate term u 
s 
government and agency obligations 
the company s investment portfolio is evaluated on a monthly basis at its asset liability management committee alco meetings 
based on the following  the company considers its liquidity and capital resources sufficient to meet its outstanding short term and long term needs 
uses of funds 
the primary investing activities of the company are the origination of loans to be held for investment  the purchase and sale of securities and capital expenditures 
investment security purchases during the year ended december  increased in the fourth quarter as the company purchased approximately million in pools of investment grade whole loans that were purchased at a discount  diversified throughout the country  carried an average coupon rate of  and have credit scores above the company expects to continue to purchase these types of investments in as the opportunities 
table of contents present themselves 
the asset liability committee will review these purchases and monitor their performance 
given the concentration of lending in the state of michigan and specifically in southeastern michigan  the committee believes these investments provide valuable diversification and a premium return as compared to retail lending rates 
the company primarily uses its funds for the following to originate mortgages and other new loans  to fund withdrawals of deposits and to pay interest on deposits  to fund takedowns on loan commitments and letters of credit  to invest in securities  including fhlb stock  to pay principal and interest on its borrowings  to fund any capital expenditures which  for the upcoming fiscal year  are expected to include renovation of the interiors of the certain branch offices and enhancements to our information technology systems  to fund any acquisitions if the opportunity arises  to pay dividends to its shareholders and to fund repurchases of the company s stock pursuant to common stock repurchase plans approved by the company s board of directors 
at december   the company had outstanding unfunded commitments to originate loans or to refinance existing loans of million  million of which had fixed interest rates 
these loans are generally to be secured by properties located in its market area 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments 
loan commitments have  in recent periods  been funded through cash and cash equivalents  sales of loans  sales and maturities of securities and borrowings 
in addition  certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december  total million 
to the extent that the company needs to fund maturing certificates of deposit  they will also be funded through cash and cash equivalents  increased deposits  sales of loans and sales and maturities of securities  fhlb borrowings and brokered deposits 
based on past experience  however  management believes that a significant portion of these certificates of deposit will remain with the company

in addition to the financial commitments discussed above  the company also currently pays  and intends to continue paying  regular quarterly dividends out of its net earnings 
however  any determination regarding the timing and amount of future dividends  if any  is at the discretion of the company s board and depends upon the company s results of operations  financial condition  cash requirements  future business prospects  general business conditions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant 
at this time  the company does not believe that the continued payment of its regular quarterly dividend will negatively impact the company s liquidity in any material respect 
for information regarding certain regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
the company also has implemented a share repurchase program  the operation of which is not expected to have any significant impact on the company s liquidity 
for more information on the company s stock repurchase programs  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
sources of funds 
the company s primary sources of funds consist of deposits  brokered deposits  loan repayments  payments of interest on loans  proceeds from the sale of loans originated for sale  maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the fhlb or correspondent banks  cash on hand and cash on deposit 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  loan prepayments  and mortgage loan originations and sales are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and due from depository institutions as well as securities maturing in one year or less 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and deposits in other depository institutions totaled million and securities available for sale totaled million 
during  the company increased it offering of brokered cd s issued in the national markets by approximately million for a total of million 
the cd s have terms from years to years with an average life of years and are callable at the option of the bank

the average life of a loan generally is substantially less than its contractual term because of prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on loans usually give the company the right to declare loans immediately due and payable under certain circumstances  including  for example  if the borrower sells the real property with the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of a mortgage loan tends to increase  
table of contents however  when current mortgage loan market interest rates are substantially higher than interest rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  tends to decrease when interest rates on existing mortgage loans are substantially higher than current mortgage loan market interest rates 
current mortgage loan market interest rates are generally higher than rates on existing mortgage loans in the company s portfolio  which suggests that the average lives of our portfolio and serviced mortgage loans may be higher than might otherwise have been expected in previous years 
the company also originates fixed rate mortgage loans conforming to freddie mac guidelines generally for sale in the secondary market 
the proceeds of these sales provide the company with funds for both additional lending and liquidity to meet its current obligations

regulatory capital requirements 
the company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal deposit insurance corporation  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at december   the company exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements 
the company is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
new accounting standards 
there were several new accounting standards which were issued or became effective in  in addition to some which have later effective dates 
those that are applicable to the company are discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
effect of inflation and changing prices 
the company s consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations  increased loan amounts and increased interest rates which must include a real rate of return and an additional amount to reflect expected inflation over the term of the loan 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 

table of contents the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect our operating performance and financial condition in diverse ways 
our profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest spread  which is the difference between the rates we receive on loans and investments and the rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funds 
sudden fluctuations in market interest rates are inherently uncertain and could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company to the extent that the interest rates on assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
for example  the company s assets include a large number of fixed rate mortgage loans 
as a result  during periods of rising interest rates  there is a risk that the company s interest expense will increase faster than its interest income 
over the last few years  the company  along with most other financial institutions  has experienced a margin squeeze as lower interest rates have made it difficult to maintain a more favorable net interest spread 
the company manages interest rate risk within an overall asset liability framework 
the company s principal objectives regarding interest rate risk management are to evaluate regularly the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  to determine the level of risk appropriate given the company s financial condition and outlook  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and to manage interest rate risk consistent with the company s board of directors approved guidelines 
funding positions are kept within predetermined limits designed to ensure that risk taking is not excessive and that liquidity is properly managed 
in the event that our asset liability management strategies are unsuccessful  our profitability may be adversely affected 
the company has an asset liability management committee that is responsible for accomplishing the principal objectives of interest rate risk management 
the committee regularly reviews the company s guidelines and strategies affecting the company s asset liability management related activities to determine if they are adequate based on estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits set by the company s board and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
the committee is composed of members of management and regularly meets to review the company s asset liability mix 
it also reports trends  interest rate risk position and results of current interest rate risk management strategies and recommends any changes to strategies to the board of directors quarterly 
in recent years  the company has used the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate loans and the sale of longer term  fixed rate loans  emphasizing shorter term consumer loans  maintaining a high quality portfolio of short to intermediate term securities and using fhlb advances  callable at the option of the company brokered cd s and other borrowings to better structure the maturities of its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
adverse market interest rate changes between the time that a customer receives a rate lock commitment on a mortgage and when the fully funded mortgage loan is sold to an investor can erode the value of that mortgage 
the company enters into forward sales contracts in order to mitigate this particular interest rate risk 
the company accepts credit risk in forward sales contracts should the other party default  in which case the company would be compelled to sell the mortgages to another party at the current market price 
therefore  if market interest rates increased from the date of the forward sales contract and the other party defaulted  the company would most likely have to sell the mortgage to another party at a lower price  which would reduce earnings or create losses on this mortgage 
more recently  the company has used some of its excess liquidity to increase its loan portfolios 
as liquidity is reduced  the company s sensitivity to interest rate movements is expected to increase 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
the company uses a simulation model based on discounted cash flows to measure the potential impact on its net interest income of hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
the model forecasts the company s net interest income for the next year assuming that there are no changes in interest rates or the mix of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet from the end of the prior period 
after this initial forecast  the model subjects the balance sheet to instantaneous and sustained rate changes of and basis points to the treasury yield curve 
in order to determine the possible effect of the rate changes  the model uses various assumptions 
among others  these assumptions relate to the following the shape of the yield curve  the pricing characteristics of and pricing decisions regarding loans based on previous rates charged by the company  changes in deposits and borrowings based on previous rates charged by the company and other competitive conditions  reinvestments of cash flows from assets and liabilities based on current market interest rates  the lack of any changes in the mix of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet  the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods to repricing react to changes in market interest rates based on particular characteristics of those assets and liabilities  expected prepayment rates on loans and investments based on industry standards and the current interest rate environment  certificates of deposit and other deposit flows based on expected maturity dates and expected growth based on the company s projections 

table of contents the table below sets forth  as of december   estimated net interest income and the estimated changes in the company s net interest income for the next twelve month period that could occur as a result of instantaneous changes in market interest rates of and basis points estimated change in annual net interest income increase decrease in market interest at december  dollars in thousands rates in basis points rate shock amount change change static the above table indicates that in the event of a sudden and sustained decline in prevailing market interest rates  the company s net interest income would be expected to decrease 
as noted above  computation of the prospective effect of hypothetical interest rate changes is based on a number of assumptions 
the calculation of the interest rate sensitivity of the company could vary significantly if different assumptions were used  or if the company s response to changes in interest rates included changes in the mix of assets and liabilities in its balance sheet 
other shortcomings also exist in the table 
these shortcomings include the following  among others although certain assets may have similar maturities or repricing characteristics  they may react in different degrees to changes in interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate and residential mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of repayments on loans and early withdrawals from time deposits could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
if interest rates increased  it is also possible that the increased mortgage payments required of certain borrowers could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults 
changes in interest rates could also affect the volume and profitability of the company s lending operations 
as a result of these and other shortcomings in the model determining the prospective effects of interest rate changes  the computations in the table should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in market interest rates 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake to respond to changes in interest rates 
forward sales contracts as of december  have settlement dates of less than days 
the weighted average settlement interest rate for these contracts was
