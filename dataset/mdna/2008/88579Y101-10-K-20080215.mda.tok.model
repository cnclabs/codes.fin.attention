capital expenditures were billion in and are expected to total billion to billion in critical accounting estimates information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note as stated in note  the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings  the company s pension and postretirement obligations  asset impairments and income taxes 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of m s board of directors 
legal proceedings the categories of claims for which the company has estimated its probable liability  the amount of its liability accruals  and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings 
please refer to the section entitled accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings contained in legal proceedings in note for additional information about such estimates 
pension and postretirement obligations m has various company sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost  and sfas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  which was issued in september and effective as of december  sfas no 
requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a component of stockholders equity 
pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant s years of service  compensation  and age at retirement or termination 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and liability measurement 
the assumed health care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption 
see note for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 
the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december measurement date for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks at rates of return on fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high  investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies 
using this methodology  the company determined a discount rate of to be appropriate as of december   which is an increase of of a percentage point from the rate used as of december  a significant element in determining the company s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets  which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes 
for the us pension plan  the company s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was for and will be reduced to for refer to note for information on how this rate is determined 
for the year ended december   the company recognized total consolidated pre tax pension expense after settlements  curtailments and special termination benefits of million  down from million in pension expense before settlements  curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to decrease to approximately million in for the pension plans  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of of a percentage point would decrease increase pension expense by approximately million for us pension plans and approximately million for international pension plans 
also  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities of of a percentage point would decrease increase pension expense by approximately million for us pension plans and approximately million for international pension plans 
see note for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation 
asset impairments m net property  plant and equipment totaled billion as of december  management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time 
this includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business  including assets of acquired businesses 
these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant 
for instance  expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit 
impairments recorded in and related to restructuring actions and other exit activities are discussed in note m goodwill totaled approximately billion as of december   which  based on impairment testing  is not impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level 
reporting units are one level below the business segment level  but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics 
the majority of goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price earnings ratio for comparable industry groups  or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 
income taxes the extent of m s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international tax audits 
the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
as of january   the company follows fin guidance to record these liabilities refer to note for additional information 
the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company s current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if the company s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary

the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in therefore  the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the us plans funding status as of the measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution 
future contributions will also depend on market conditions  interest rates and other factors
