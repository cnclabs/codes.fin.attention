item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations general the effects of seasonal weather conditions  timing of rate increases  fluctuations in demand due to the cost of fuel passed on to customers  and the migration of winter residents and tourists to florida during the winter season  have a significant impact on income 
revenues and gross profit summary the fpsc allows us to bill and include in our revenue the costs of fuel  conservation  and revenue based taxes  incurred in our natural gas and electric segments 
revenues collected for these expenses have no effect on results of operations and fluctuations could distort the relationship of revenues between periods 
gross profit is defined as gross operating revenues less fuel  conservation and revenue based taxes that are passed directly through to customers 
because gross profit eliminates these cost recovery revenues  we believe it provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility revenues 
the following summary compares gross profit  units sold  and average customers for the past three years 
units sold are shown in one thousand dekatherm mdth for gas and megawatt hour mwh for electric 
revenues and gross profit dollars in thousands years ended december  natural gas revenues cost of fuel and other pass through costs gross profit units sold mdth customers average for the period electric revenues cost of fuel and other pass through costs gross profit units sold mwh customers average for the period propane gas revenues cost of fuel gross profit units sold mdth customers average for the period consolidated revenues cost of fuel and other pass through costs gross profit customers average for the period natural gas natural gas revenues decreased million  or in over as the cost of natural gas continued to decline  the revenue to recover the fuel costs  which are passed through to customers  decreased by million 
our gross profit  which excludes expenses directly passed through to customers  decreased by  or 
although customer growth was up in compared to  we experienced a decrease in units sold primarily due to milder weather 
natural gas revenues increased million  or in over primarily due to increased revenue collected for taxes passed directly through to customers 
a change in legislation regarding the calculation of gross receipts tax became effective january   and along with an increase to overall revenues  increased these taxes paid by our customers by approximately  franchise fee revenues also increased by approximately  due to increased rates and area expansion 
natural gas gross profit increased  or in over we had higher revenue and gross profit in compared to primarily due to billed revenue not exceeding the fpsc allowable earnings as much as in the prior year 
in  we reduced billed revenues and gross profit by our estimate of over earnings of  for the year 
our estimate for was recorded at  in and we reduced that estimate in by  to  the combined effect of this was to increase our revenues and gross profit over the prior year by approximately  other factors contributing to the increase in revenues and gross profit were customer growth and storm surcharge revenues  which became effective november the revenues and gross profit increases were slightly offset by the loss of approximately  of revenue from two customers who went off line for several months to do maintenance work 
electric electric revenues increased million or in over cost of fuel and other costs that were passed through to customers contributed to million of the increase as a result of the new fuel contracts effective january  in our northeast division 
gross profit  which excludes the fuel and other costs passed through in revenue  was flat compared to although the number of customers increased by  there was a marginal decrease in units sold  excluding units sold to industrial customers  as a result of possible conservation measures taken by our customers due to the fuel cost increases 
electric revenues increased million in over cost of fuel and other costs that were passed through to customers contributed approximately  of the increase 
gross profit increased  or in over the increase in gross profit was primarily due to a slight increase in customer growth and units sold 
propane gas propane revenues increased million  or 
higher fuel costs caused  of this increase 
gross profit increased  or in compared to we experienced a decrease in units sold to customers due to warmer weather  however  this was offset by increased rates and service fees 
propane revenues increased million  or and gross profit increased  or in compared to revenues increased primarily due to rising fuel costs 
although customers increased by in  the usage per customer declined by contributing to a decrease of in units sold 
warmer weather was the primary reason for this decrease in usage per customer in compared to the increase in gross profit was minimal when compared to primarily due to pre buy gains of  realized in but not in operating expenses operating expenses include operation  maintenance  depreciation  amortization and taxes other than income taxes  and exclude fuel costs  conservation and taxes based on revenues that are directly passed through to customers and recovered in revenues 
operating expenses dollars in thousands year ended december  natural gas electric propane gas total operating expenses natural gas natural gas operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with administrative expenses accounted for  of the increase and are discussed in a separate section below 
depreciation expense increased  due in part to construction of mains and additional meters to distribute gas to new developments in south florida along with increasing capacity requirements for existing customers 
as a result of a new management focus to offset the effects of the construction industry and housing market slowdown  we increased our efforts to provide improved customer service and upgraded our existing meter equipment resulting in an increase of related expenses of  this increase was offset by a  reduction in sales expense resulting from the elimination of three sales positions due to cut backs related to the slowdown in the housing market 
natural gas operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with outside of the normal inflationary impacts on our expenses  customer account expenses increased by  as a result of our customer service focus initiated in based on our strategic plan 
we continued the focus on this area and increased the number of employees in an effort to respond more effectively to customers 
bad debt provision increased  over the prior year primarily due to increasing revenues  aging accounts receivable on several major accounts  and the slowing housing economy 
we increased our collection efforts in the fourth quarter of and continued those efforts in in  we had additional increases of  to sales expense resulting from initiatives to boost sales by increasing sales staff 
depreciation expense increased  principally due to construction of mains and new meters to distribute gas to a growing number of new developments in south florida and increasing capacity requirements for existing customers 
electric electric operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with administrative expenses accounted for  of the increase and are discussed in a separate section below 
due to a quiet hurricane season this year  we were able to re direct work efforts and make some operating and safety improvements of our overall electric system  which increased operating expenses by  as a result of a milder storm season  we experienced a decrease in weather related maintenance of conduct  lines and poles expenses of electric operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with as a result of our efforts to inform and educate our electric customers about the expected and fuel rate increases in upcoming bills  sales expense increased by  customer account expenses increased  in over the prior year mainly due to increased bad debt provisions due to higher sales and slower housing economy 
depreciation expense increased  largely due to major construction work done in the latter part of and the beginning of this included the rebuilding of a transmission sub station  the rebuilding of an entire distribution sub station with two transformers and the replacement of a failed sub distribution station transformer 
propane gas propane gas operating expenses decreased  or  in as compared with the major reason for the decrease was lower selling expenses as a result of a drop in demand from the slowdown of new construction in south florida 
additionally  the summer glen project was converted from a propane system to natural gas in the fourth quarter of causing all related expenses to shift to our natural gas segment 
propane gas operating expenses increased  or  in as compared with depreciation expense increased  for the addition of plant assets including a propane gas delivery system to increase the efficiency of our deliveries and improve our overall customer satisfaction 
aging accounts receivable  slowing housing economy and increasing revenues contributed to an increase in our bad debt expense over administrative expenses administrative expenses increased  or  in over several unusual claims resulting in settlements were the primary reasons for the  increase to our liability expenses 
these claims were for several general liability suits related to auto  employment and liability issues 
in addition  our payroll expenses increased  as a result of annual pay raises 
administrative expenses increased  or  in over these expenses generally were related to all of our operating segments 
to continue to adequately support our internal and external customers  we increased staffing in our administrative areas 
payroll increases of  related to an increased number of employees  annual pay raises and normal inflationary impacts 
in  we discontinued eligibility to our defined benefit pension plan for new employees and replaced the defined benefit pension plan with a k match plan for new employees 
this change will take time to reduce pension expense  we had an increase of  in our pension expenses in medical costs increased  over total other income and deductions other income and deductions include revenues and expenses from sales  installation  and service of merchandise  gains and losses on disposal of property  interest expense  and miscellaneous income and expenses 
merchandise sales and installation and interest expenses are the largest components of this section and are discussed below 
merchandise and services revenue and expenses merchandise and services revenue and expense decreased by  and  respectively  although our overall profit increased  a lower number of product installations actually improved our profit margin on the installation side of our business 
we had less customer owned tank installations and we discontinued generator sales  both are historically less profitable 
we continue to face a slowdown in the construction industry and housing market to an even greater degree in  and this along with a quiet hurricane season  dramatically reduced the demand for new merchandise 
management does not anticipate the housing market will rebound in  and expects reduced sales levels to continue 
although merchandise and services revenue decreased by approximately  in  the overall profitability in this area increased by  compared to this was primarily a result of significant strategic changes made by management 
these changes included revising the product markup structure  increasing installation fees and increasing employee training 
we experienced a revenue decrease due to lower demand for merchandise as a result of a quiet hurricane season and the slowdown of new construction projects in our areas due to the downturn in the housing market 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest on bonds  short term borrowings  over earnings and customer deposits 
in  interest expense increased  including  interest on our over earnings that was approved by the commission for the natural gas segment and interest on our increased credit line for additional funding of over million to purchase the new site to relocate our south florida operations facility 
other other non operating income increased  compared to the prior year primarily due to income generated from a sale of land at rainbow lakes 
income taxes income tax expense decreased in by  over due to lower taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources summary of primary sources and uses of cash dollars in thousands year ended december  sources of cash operating activities  including working capital changes net proceeds on short term debt other sources of cash uses of cash construction expenditures dividends paid net payment on short term debt other uses of cash net source use of cash cash flows operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased in by approximately million compared to we had a million decrease related to refunding the prior over recovery of fuel and other pass through costs 
net cash flow provided by operating activities increased in by approximately million compared to fuel and other pass through costs accounted for million of the increase 
this increase resulted from the collection of the prior year s under recoveries of million and over recoveries of million in amounts over recovered are refunded to customers in subsequent calendar years 
lower fuel costs during the latter part of the year in our natural gas segment contributed to a decrease in receivables and increase in cash of million 
the lower fuel costs and timing of payments to our major fuel suppliers resulted in a decrease to operating cash of million 
income taxes paid increased by approximately  primarily due to the tax effect of the collection of prior year s fuel under recoveries 
investing activities capital expenditures increased in compared to by approximately million 
the major component of the increase was the purchase of land for approximately million for the future site of our south florida operations facility 
capital expenditures increased in compared to by approximately  the increase in included expenditures for transportation equipment in our electric segment for approximately  vehicles in our natural gas segment above levels of approximately  and various other typical capital expenditures 
offsetting total increases was a  transformer replacement in financing activities short term borrowings increased by approximately million in the main reasons for the increase were the purchase of land for our south florida operations center and the repayment of over recoveries of fuel costs from prior periods 
short term borrowings decreased by million in over recovery of fuel costs provided a large source of cash during as well as the recovery of the prior year s under recovery of fuel costs in  reducing the need for short term borrowings 
capital resources we have a million line of credit with bank of america  which expires on july  upon days notice we can increase the line of credit to a maximum of million 
the line of credit contains affirmative and negative covenants that  if violated  would give the bank the right to accelerate the due date of the loan to be immediately payable 
the covenants include certain financial ratios 
all ratios are currently met and management believes we are in full compliance with all covenants and anticipates continued compliance 
in march we amended the line of credit to increase the maximum credit line to million and to extend the expiration of the line to see below  outlook and subsequent events 
we reserve million of the line of credit to cover expenses for any major storm repairs in our electric segment and an additional  for a letter of credit insuring propane gas facilities 
as of december   the amount borrowed on the line of credit was million 
the line of credit  long term debt and preferred stock as of december  comprised of total debt and equity capitalization 
historically we have periodically paid off short term borrowings under lines of credit using the net proceeds from the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
we continue to review our financing options including increasing our short term line of credit  issuing equity  or issuing debt 
the choice of financing will be dependent on prevailing market conditions  the impact to our financial covenants and the effect on income 
the timing of additional funding will be dependent on projected environmental expenditures  building of the south florida operations facility  pension contributions  and other capital expenditures 
our indenture of mortgage and deed of trust  which is a mortgage on all real and personal property  permits the issuance of additional bonds based upon a calculation of unencumbered net real and personal property 
at december   such calculation would permit the issuance of approximately million of additional bonds 
on october  we received approval from the fpsc to issue and sell or exchange an additional amount of million in any combination of long term debt  short term notes and equity securities and or to assume liabilities or obligations as guarantor  endorser or surety during calendar year in the event we choose not to proceed in with such a financing  we may seek approval from the fpsc in for any possible financing in we have million in invested funds for payment of future environmental costs 
we expect to use some or all of these funds in there is approximately million in receivables from the sale of our water assets  of which an estimated installment of  is anticipated to be received in the remaining balance of million will be collected in the present value of this receivable is million 
capital requirements portions of our business are seasonal and dependent upon weather conditions in florida 
this factor affects the sale of electricity and gas and impacts the cash provided by operations 
construction costs also impact cash requirements throughout the year 
cash needs for operations and construction are met partially through short term borrowings from our line of credit 
capital expenditures are expected to be lower in compared to by approximately million because the anticipated million for the construction of the building for the new south florida operations facility in is lower than the million related to the purchase of land for the new south florida operations facility that occurred in cash requirements will increase significantly in the future due to environmental cleanup costs  sinking fund payments on long term debt and pension contributions 
environmental cleanup is forecast to require payments of approximately million in  with remaining payments  which could total approximately million  beginning in annual long term debt sinking fund payments of approximately million will begin in and will continue for eleven years 
based on current projections  we will make a voluntary contribution in our defined benefit pension plan of  in for the preceding year and will continue for future years to make contributions as required by the pension protection act funding rules 
based on our current expectations for cash needs  including the construction of our south florida operations facility  we may rely on the increased line of credit or may choose to consider equity or debt financing 
the need and timing will depend upon operational requirements  the timing of environmental expenditures  pension contributions and construction expenditures 
in addition  if we experience significant environmental expenditures in the next two or three years it is possible we may need to raise additional funds after we continue to assess the feasibility of refinancing our mortgage bonds 
if refinancing is deemed cost effective  we may re issue a bond for additional principal 
many of our bonds contain prepayment penalties which effectively make refinancing impractical 
there can be no assurance  however  that equity or debt transaction financing will be available on favorable terms or at all when we make the decision to proceed with a financing transaction 
outlook and subsequent events electric power supply contracts in our northeast division  we entered into a new long term supply agreement that began january  and will expire december  we executed a contract for the provider of electricity in our northwest division in december and the contract was approved by the fpsc in july this contract will be for the purchase of electricity beginning january  and will expire december  the new supply contracts have resulted in variable rates closer to market  which may cause our customers bills to double during over past fixed prices 
we are unable to precisely estimate what impact the higher rates could have on electric consumption but we expect there could be as much as a reduction in sales 
over earnings and storm reserve natural gas segment on august  the commission finalized the disposition of over earnings for the natural gas segment of  plus interest of natural gas over earnings summary dollars in thousands december  before application of psc order adjustment after application of psc order current assets other regulatory assets storm reserve current assets other regulatory assets storm reserve capitalization and liabilities over earnings liability regulatory liability storm reserve revenues natural gas revenue other income and deductions interest expense on customer deposits and other the commission ordered the over earnings to be applied against the regulatory asset storm reserve in our natural gas operations and the storm surcharge collected from customers 
the remaining over earnings was used to fund a storm reserve for future storm costs 
the storm reserve for our natural gas division as of december  is approximately  we recorded estimated over earnings for the natural gas segment of  interest accrued on this estimated over earnings as of december  is  this liability is included in the over earnings liability on our balance sheet 
the calculations supporting these liabilities are complex and involve a variety of projections and estimates before the ultimate settlement of such obligations 
estimates may be revised as expectations change and factors become known and determinable 
our estimates of our over earnings liabilities could change upon the fpsc finalization of our earnings expected during the fpsc determines the disposition of over earnings with alternatives that include refunds to customers  funding storm or environmental reserves  or reducing any depreciation reserve deficiency 
storm preparedness expenses regulators continue to focus on hurricane preparedness and storm recovery issues for utility companies 
newly mandated storm preparedness initiatives could impact our operating expenses and capital expenditures in the current forecast is not expected to exceed additional annual expenditures of approximately  it is possible that additional regulation and rules will be mandated regarding storm related expenditures over the next several years 
we requested that the fpsc allow us to recover the cost of the newly mandated storm preparedness initiatives and to defer these storm related expenditures until we receive recovery through a rate increase 
the recovery of these costs and revisions  if any  of our storm preparedness initiatives will be considered in our upcoming electric rate proceeding in the first quarter of land purchase we purchased land for million in july for a new south florida operations facility 
we are in the process of preparing plans for a building on this property and expect to begin construction in summer glen conversion in september we successfully completed the conversion of homes from propane to natural gas within a large gated community in our central florida division 
the conversion will allow customers to take advantage of lower natural gas rates and provide the company with greater customer retention 
the community is still in the process of building new homes and when completed will result in  residential natural gas accounts 
medical insurance we continue to experience increases in our medical insurance costs 
based on negotiations  management expects an increase of approximately or  in over electric base rate proceeding we filed a request with the fpsc in the third quarter of for a base rate increase in our electric segment 
this request includes recovery of increased expenses and capital expenditures since our last rate proceeding in  as well as additional storm preparedness expenditures as discussed above 
finalization of this request and approval  if any  of an electric base rate increase would not occur until the second quarter of interim rate relief for partial recovery of the increased expenditures was approved by the commission on october  interim rates which should produce additional annual revenues of approximately  went into effect for meter readings on and after november  the permanent rates may differ from the interim rates  and the interim rates are collected subject to refund with interest 
if the commission approves partial recovery instead of full recovery of the requested rate increase including recovery of increased expenses  return on capital expenditures or our requested cost of common equity  the impact to our and future net operating income in our electric segments could be lower than anticipated 
electric depreciation study on january   the commission approved new electric depreciation rates effective january  that are expected to increase depreciation expense by approximately  in management expects the commission will approve recovery of this increased depreciation expense in our electric rate proceeding 
regulatory asset liability retirement plans the company filed a petition with the florida public service commission in for approval to defer a portion of our costs associated with fasb in a regulatory asset or liability that would have otherwise been recorded in equity 
in february  the fpsc approved deferral of these costs associated with our regulated pension and retiree s medical plan 
contractual obligations table of contractual obligations dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations long term debt interest unrecognized tax benefits natural gas and propane gas purchase obligations electric purchase obligations other purchase obligations total long term debt obligations the long term debt obligations are principal amounts 
long term debt interest the long term debt interest represents the interest obligation on our mortgage bonds 
fin obligations we performed an assessment of our uncertain tax positions as of december   and recognized a fin liability for various tax positions relating solely to the timing of various tax deductions 
these tax positions relate to the through tax years 
natural gas and propane gas purchase obligations our natural gas purchase obligations consist of those contracts necessary to arrange for the purchase of natural gas to meet our demand requirements as well as those contacts necessary to arrange for the interstate and intrastate transport to our gate stations 
in addition  our propane gas purchase obligations consist of those contracts necessary to arrange for the purchase and delivery of propane gas to our storage facilities to meet demand requirements 
electric purchase obligations during we completed negotiations and executed final contracts for the supply of electricity in our northeast division beginning january  and our northwest division beginning in january  the new contracts  effective in and  significantly increased our contractual obligations over prior years due to a minimum purchase provision 
purchase obligations a purchase order is considered an obligation if it is associated with a contract or is authorizing a specific purchase of material 
the other purchase obligation amount presented above represents the amount of open purchase orders 
pension  medical postretirement and other obligations our pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations  however  under current actuarial assumptions contributions may be required as early as current projections indicate that we will make a voluntary contribution of  in for our pension plan year and will continue in future years to make contributions as required by the pension protection act funding rules 
these payments are not included in the contractual obligations table 
environmental cleanup is anticipated to require approximately million in  the remainder to be paid in following years 
these payments are not included in the contractual obligations table 
we have medical postretirement payments relating to retiree medical insurance 
these payments are not included in the contractual obligations table 
estimated future payments are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
dividends we have historically paid dividends 
it is our intention to continue to pay quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future 
our dividend policy is reviewed on an ongoing basis by our board of directors and is dependent upon our future earnings  cash flow  financial condition  capital requirements and other factors 
line of credit in march  we amended our line of credit with bank of america to allow us  upon days notice  to increase our maximum credit line to million from million 
the new agreement expires july  the amendment also reduces the interest rate paid on borrowings by or basis points

as this revision is adopted prospectively and all qualifying future business combinations would be evaluated under the new provisions  the effects on our results of operations will depend on the nature and size of any future acquisitions 
critical accounting policies and estimates regulatory accounting we prepare our financial statements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation and it is our most critical accounting policy 
in general  sfas no 
recognizes that accounting for rate regulated enterprises should reflect the relationship of costs and revenues introduced by rate regulation 
as a result  a regulated utility may defer recognition of a cost a regulatory asset or recognize an obligation a regulatory liability if it is probable that  through the rate making process  there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in revenues or expenses 
sfas no 
does not apply to our unregulated propane gas operations 
criteria that give rise to the discontinuance of sfas include increasing competition that restricts our ability to establish prices to recover specific costs  and a significant change in the manner in which rates are set by regulators from cost based regulation to another form of regulation 
we periodically review these criteria to ensure that the continuing application of sfas is appropriate 
based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery  we believe that our regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
use of estimates we are required to use estimates in preparing our financial statements so they will be in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the accruals for potential liabilities are adequate 
the estimates in our financial statements included the accrual for pensions  environmental liabilities  over earnings liability  unbilled revenues  allowances for doubtful accounts  uninsured liability claims and the regulatory deferred income tax and deferred income tax liabilities 
pension and post retirement benefits an actuary calculates the estimated pension liability in accordance with fasb  fasb as amended by fasb and fasb environmental liabilities these liabilities are subject to certain unknown future events 
the company reviews the environmental issues regularly with the geologists performing the feasibility studies and their legal counsel specializing in manufactured gas plant issues and negotiates with the environmental regulators and the other participating parties to determine the adequacy of the estimated liability for environmental reserves 
over earnings liability this liability is subject to regulatory review and possible disallowance of some expenses in determining the amount of over earnings 
unbilled revenues unbilled revenue is estimated with certain assumptions including unaccounted for units and the use of current month sales to estimate unbilled sales 
allowances for doubtful accounts this liability is estimated based on historical information and trended current economic conditions  certain assumptions  and is subject to unknown future events 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
uninsured liability claims we are self insured for the first  of each general and auto liability claim and accrue for estimated losses occurring from both asserted and unasserted claims 
the estimate for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents is based on an analysis of historical claims data and judgment 
regulatory deferred income tax and deferred income tax liabilities these liabilities are estimated based on historical data and are subject to finalization of our income tax return 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenue recognition we bill utility customers on a monthly cycle basis  however  the billing cycle periods for most customers do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting 
we accrue estimated revenue for gas and electric customers for consumption used but not yet billed for in an accounting period 
determination of unbilled revenue relies on the use of estimates and historical data 
we believe that the estimates for unbilled revenue materially reflect the unbilled gross profit for our customers for units used but not yet billed in the current period 
the fpsc approves rates that are intended to permit a specified rate of return on investment and limits the maximum amount of earnings of regulated operations 
any earnings in excess of this maximum amount are accrued for as an over earnings liability and revenues are reduced for this same amount 
the calculations supporting these liabilities are complex and involve a variety of projections and estimates before the ultimate settlement of such obligations 
the fpsc determines the disposition of any over earnings with alternatives that include refunding to customers  funding storm damage or environmental reserves or reducing any depreciation reserve deficiency 
effects of inflation our tariffs for natural gas and electric operations provide for fuel clauses that adjust annually for changes in the cost of fuel 
increases in other utility costs and expenses not offset by increases in revenues or reductions in other expenses could have an adverse effect on earnings due to the time lag associated with obtaining regulatory approval to recover such increased costs and expenses  the uncertainty of whether regulatory commissions will allow full recovery of such increased costs and expenses and any effect on unregulated propane gas operations 
environmental matters we currently use or have used in the past  several contamination sites that are currently involved in pending or threatened environmental litigation as discussed in note contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend our rights in this litigation 
we have insurance and rate relief to cover any expected losses or expenses 
we believe that the aggregate of all future contamination assessment and remedial costs  legal fees and other related expenses would not exceed the insurance proceeds received and any rate relief granted 
the final natural gas rate relief granted by the fpsc provided future recovery of million for environmental liabilities 
the remaining balance to be recovered from customers through future recovery is included on the balance sheet as other regulatory assets environmental 
forward looking statements cautionary statement this report contains forward looking statements including those relating to the following expectations based on our current expectations for cash needs  including cash needs relating to construction of the south florida operations facility  we may choose to consider an equity or debt financing 
our anticipation of continued compliance in the foreseeable future with our loc covenants 
our expectation that cash requirements will increase significantly in the future due to environmental clean up costs  sinking fund payment on long term debt and pension contributions 
storm hardening related expenditures may be necessary in and the total cost may be significant 
we may receive recovery for these expenditures 
our over earnings liability in natural gas will materialize as estimated 
we expect higher fuel costs in our electric divisions could have an impact on electric consumption 
the summer glen customer growth will occur as expected 
finalization and approval of an electric base rate increase is expected in the second quarter of medical expenses are expected to increase in management does not anticipate the housing market will rebound in these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from what is expressed in such forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those set forth above in risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial instruments held by us were entered into for purposes other than for trading 
we have market risk exposure only from the potential loss in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates 
we have no material exposure relating to commodity prices because under our regulatory jurisdictions  we are fully compensated for the actual costs of commodities natural gas and electricity used in our operations 
any commodity price increases for propane gas are normally passed through monthly to propane gas customers as the fuel charge portion of their rate 
none of our gas or electric contracts are accounted for using the fair value method of accounting 
while some of our contracts meet the definition of a derivative  we have designated these contracts as normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we have decided not to implement a hedging plan combining purchasing caps and swaps 
we had tentatively decided that on a rolling four quarter basis  we would purchase a cap on approximately one third of our forecast propane volume purchases and pre buy or hedge with a swap one third of our forecast anticipated propane purchases 
instead  we decided to use a combination of pre purchasing propane gas and purchasing at fluctuating market prices 
as of december   we had not entered into any hedging activities  and we do not anticipate entering into hedging activities in we have no exposure to equity risk  as we do not hold any material equity instruments 
our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to investments held for environmental costs  the long term notes receivable from the sale of our water division and short term borrowings on the line of credit 
the investments held for environmental costs are short term fixed income debt securities whose carrying amounts are not materially different than fair value 
the short term borrowings were approximately million at the end of december we do not believe we have material market risk exposure related to these instruments 
the indentures governing our two first mortgage bond series outstanding contain make whole provisions pre payment penalties that charge for lost interest  which render refinancing impracticable until sometime after our non interest bearing long term receivable from the sale of the water operations was discounted at 
a hypothetical basis points increase in the interest rate used would change the current fair value from million to million 
in  a hypothetical basis points decrease in the long term interest rate on million debt excluding unamortized debt discount would change the fair value from million to million 
changes in short term interest rates could have an effect on income depending on the balance borrowed on the variable rate line of credit 
we had short term debt of million on december  and million on december  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in annual earnings for by  and for by  based on year end borrowings
