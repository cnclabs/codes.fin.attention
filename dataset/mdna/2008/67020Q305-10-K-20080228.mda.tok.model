this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
for additional information regarding some of these risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  please see risk factors and forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
overview for purposes of this discussion relative to the financial and operational results and cash flows for the years ended 
table of contents december  and in comparison to the year ended december   we have combined the financial and operational results and cash flows for the period january  to may  of ntelos inc with our financial and operational results and cash flows for the period may  to december  we had no operating activities prior to the completion of our acquisition of ntelos inc on may  we believe this comparison provides the most practical way to comment on the results of operations and cash flows 
we are a leading provider of wireless and wireline communications services to consumers and businesses primarily in virginia and west virginia under the ntelos brand name 
our wireless operations are composed of an ntelos branded retail business and a wholesale business that we operate under an exclusive contract with sprint spectrum lp  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of sprint nextel corporation hereinafter collectively referred to as sprint nextel 
we believe our regional focus and contiguous service area provide us with a differentiated competitive position relative to our primary wireless competitors  all of whom are national providers 
our wireless revenues have experienced a compound annual growth rate from to and accounted for of our total revenues in we hold digital pcs licenses to operate in basic trading areas with a licensed population of approximately million  and we have deployed a network using code division multiple access technology  or cdma  in basic trading areas which currently covers a total population of approximately million potential subscribers 
as of december   our wireless retail business had approximately  ntelos branded subscribers  representing a penetration of our total covered population 
we made significant investments in our wireless network in  and  adding new wireless cell sites and increasing our total cell sites to  at the end of these investments and other initiatives  including the increased take rate of national rate plans and enhanced data service offerings  contributed to a increase in subscribers  a increase in arpu  and a basis point reduction in churn during we also amended our agreement with sprint spectrum lp during to act as their exclusive wholesale provider of network services through july  under this arrangement  which we refer to as the strategic network alliance  we are the exclusive pcs service provider in our western virginia and west virginia service area for all sprint nextel cdma wireless customers see business wireless business our strategic network alliance with sprint nextel in part i  item of this k 
under the terms of the agreement  we are committed to upgrading our wireless network to evolution data optimized revision a ev do in the territory covered by the agreement 
we expect our aggregate incremental capital expenditures for through for the upgrade to ev do in all of our markets to be approximately million  of which million was spent in and million is expected to be spent in for the year ended december   we realized wholesale revenues of million  primarily related to the strategic network alliance  representing an increase of over the same period in founded in  our wireline incumbent local exchange carrier business is conducted through two subsidiaries that qualify as rlecs under the telecommunications act 
these two rlecs provide wireline communications services to residential and business customers in the western virginia communities of waynesboro  covington  clifton forge and portions of botetourt and augusta counties 
as of december   we operated approximately  rlec telephone access lines 
we also own a  mile regional fiber optic network and participate in partnerships that directly connect our networks with many of the largest markets in the mid atlantic region 
we leverage our wireline network infrastructure to offer competitive voice and data communication services in virginia and west virginia outside our rlec coverage area 
within our competitive segment  we market and sell local and long distance  voice and data services almost exclusively to business customers through our competitive local exchange carrier  or clec  and internet service provider  or isp  operation 
as of december   we served customers with approximately  clec access line connections 
we also offer dsl services in over of our rlec service area and as of december  we operated approximately  broadband access connections in our markets  representing an increase of in in  the wireline competitive segment strategic products local phone services  broadband voice and data services and high capacity network access and transport services experienced revenue growth of over in and  our wireline operating income margins were and  respectively 
in late  we introduced ntelos video in selected neighborhoods within our two rlec service areas 
the product provides an alternative to cable and satellite tv  offering video entertainment services with more than all digital channels and high definition channels 
it is delivered via fiber to the home which allows us to deliver video  internet access at speeds up to megabits per second and local and long distance telephone services 
at december   we passed approximately  homes with fiber 
revenues from the video and high speed internet product are included in the competitive wireline segment 
we were formed in january by the cvc entities and the quadrangle entities for the purpose of acquiring 
table of contents ntelos inc on january   we entered into an agreement with ntelos inc and certain of its shareholders to acquire the common stock of ntelos inc  making an initial investment on february  on may   we acquired all of ntelos inc s remaining common shares  warrants and vested options by means of a merger at which time ntelos inc became a wholly owned subsidiary 
during the first quarter of  we completed an initial public offering the ipo of  shares of our common stock at an offering price of per share 
we received proceeds from the offering of approximately million  net of million in underwriting fees and other closing costs of million 
on april   in a secondary offering of our common stock  cvc and quadrangle and certain of their affiliates sold an aggregate of  shares priced at per share 
this resulted in their combined ownership declining from to approximately 
the company did not receive any proceeds from the offering and the company s total shares outstanding did not change as a result of this offering 
direct costs of this offering  primarily legal  printing and accounting fees  totaled million 
these costs were charged to corporate operations expense 
we used approximately million of the ipo net proceeds to terminate our advisory agreements with cvc and quadrangle and million to redeem our floating rate senior notes in full including unpaid accrued interest of million on april  the remaining proceeds  combined with available cash  were used to pay a million dividend on our  shares of class b common stock on june  the payment of the dividend represented the payment in full of the million class b distribution preference provided for in our restated certificate of incorporation 
all class b common stock was subsequently converted to common stock by the end of on september   quadrangle agreed to acquire all of the shares of ntelos common stock owned by cvc and certain affiliated limited partnerships 
with this acquisition  private equity funds affiliated with quadrangle own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
we began paying cash dividends on our common stock during the board of directors declared cash dividends in the amount of per share during  which amounted to million 
other overview discussion to supplement our financial statements presented under generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  throughout this document we reference non gaap measures  such as average monthly revenues per handset unit in service  or arpu  to measure operating performance for which our operating managers are responsible and upon which we evaluate their performance 
arpu is a telecommunications industry metric that measures service revenues per period divided by the weighted average number of handsets in service during that period 
arpu as defined below may not be similar to arpu measures of other companies  is not a measurement under gaap and should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the information contained in our consolidated statements of operations 
we closely monitor the effects of new rate plans and service offerings on arpu in order to determine their effectiveness 
we believe arpu provides management useful information concerning the appeal of our rate plans and service offerings and our performance in attracting and retaining high value customers 
the table below provides a reconciliation of operating revenue from our wireless segment note in our notes to consolidated financial statements to subscriber revenues used to calculate average monthly arpu for the years ended december   and 
table of contents dollars in thousands  other than average monthly arpu data wireless communications revenues less equipment revenues from sales to new customers less equipment revenues from sales to existing customers less wholesale revenues plus other revenues and adjustments wireless gross subscriber revenues average number of subscribers total arpu wireless gross subscriber revenues less paid in advance and prepay subscriber revenues less adjustments wireless gross postpay subscriber revenues average number of postpay subscribers postpay arpu wireless gross subscriber revenues less wireless voice and other features revenues wireless data revenues average number of subscribers total data arpu in september of  we launched a new prepay billing platform which enhanced product offerings to customers and allowed the company to separately identify certain data revenues previously bundled into blended arpu  and certain of the underlying plans were modified to offer data services 
accordingly  beginning in the fourth quarter of  this revenue is included in data revenue 
this contributed to accelerated growth in year over year data arpu 
operating revenues our revenues are generated from the following categories wireless pcs  consisting of retail revenues from network access  data services  equipment revenues and feature services  and wholesale revenues from the strategic network alliance and roaming from other carriers  rlec segment revenues  including local service  network access  toll and directory advertising  competitive segment revenues  including revenues from our key strategic products local services  broadband voice and data services  and high capacity network access and transport services  iptv based video services recently launched in selected neighborhoods within our two rlec service areas  long distance and dial up internet services  and other communications services revenues  including primarily revenues from paging and revenue from leasing excess building space 
operating expenses our operating expenses are incurred from the following categories cost of sales and services  including digital pcs handset equipment costs which  in keeping with industry practice  we generally sell to our customers at a price below our cost  and usage based access charges  including long distance  roaming charges  and other direct costs incurred in accessing other 
table of contents telecommunications providers networks in order to provide telecommunication services to our end use customers  leased facility expenses for connection to other carriers  cell sites and switch locations and engineering and other expenses for service related property  plant and equipment  customer operations expenses  including marketing  product management  product advertising  selling  billing  publication of regional telephone directories  customer care  directory services and bad debt expenses  corporate operations expenses  including taxes other than income  executive  accounting  legal  purchasing  information technology  human resources and other general and administrative expenses  including earned bonuses above target achievement levels  non cash compensation expense related to the original class a common stock and option instruments held by certain members of corporate management and secondary offering costs  depreciation and amortization  including depreciable long lived property  plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets where applicable  accretion of asset retirement obligations  or aro  capital restructuring charges associated with our acquisition of ntelos inc  and termination of advisory agreements 
other income expenses our other income expenses are generated incurred from interest expense on debt instruments  including changes in fair value of our interest rate swap instrument  our equity share of the net loss of ntelos inc from our investment in ntelos inc 
for the period february  through may   other income  which includes interest income  and gain on sale of investment 
income taxes our income tax expense and effective tax rate increases or decreases based upon changes in a number of factors  including our pre tax income or loss  net operating losses and related carryforwards  valuation allowances  alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards  state minimum tax assessments  gain or loss on the sale of assets and investments  write down of assets and investments  non deductible expenses and other tax deductible amounts 
minority interests in losses earnings of subsidiaries our minority interest relates to a rlec segment investment in a partnership that owns certain signaling equipment and provides service to a number of small rlecs and to verisign 
we also have a majority interest in the virginia pcs alliance lc  or the va alliance  that provides pcs services to a million populated area in central and western virginia 
the va alliance has incurred significant cumulative operating losses since it initiated pcs services in given that the total of minority member contributions and cumulative operating results are negative during all periods reported  we recognize a credit to minority interest only to the extent of capital contributions from the minority owners 
no such contributions were made during the years ended december   and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview operating revenues increased million  or  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  wireless pcs accounted for of the increase  with growth occurring from subscriber revenues  wholesale revenues and equipment sales 
wireline contributed the remaining revenue increase primarily from minute driven increases in rlec access revenues and increases in key strategic products in the competitive segment  partially offset by declines in other revenues from the competitive segment dial up internet services  switched access and reciprocal compensation 
operating income increased million over the comparative years  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  operating margin  before non cash compensation  advisory fees and termination of advisory agreements  increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  
table of contents net income increased million from a net loss of million for the year ended december  to net income of million for the year ended december  included in net loss for the year ended december  was a charge of million for the termination of advisory agreements and interest expense that was million higher during than  which related to interest on the floating rate notes retired in april  million of non recurring interest expense charges related to the early retirement of debt and lower interest during as a result of the refinancing transaction in june non cash compensation charges were million higher during than driven by expense recognition commensurate with the ipo 
in addition  there was a million year over year increase in income tax expense  which was primarily driven by the significant change in taxable income 
operating revenues the following table identifies our external operating revenues on a business segment basis for the years ended december  and year ended december  operating revenues variance variance dollars in thousands wireless pcs wireline rlec competitive wireline total wireline other total wireless communications revenues wireless communications revenues increased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in our ntelos branded net subscriber revenue of million  or  an million  or  increase in wholesale and roaming revenues  and a million  or  increase in equipment sales revenues related to a increase in gross subscriber additions 
subscriber revenues reflected subscriber growth of  or approximately  subscribers  from approximately  subscribers as of december  to approximately  subscribers as of december  for the comparative years  subscriber revenues reflected the subscriber growth described above and also reflect an increase in arpu of  from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase in arpu is primarily attributable to the continued growth in data services  data packages and higher priced product offerings 
total data arpu was for the year ended december   up from for the year ended december  see footnote to the arpu reconciliation table above 
gross subscriber additions were higher for  at approximately  compared to gross subscriber additions of approximately  for this increase in gross additions combined with the introduction of more feature rich handsets sold in the period as compared to the period led to an increase in equipment sales revenue of million  or  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  also contributing to the revenue increase was a basis point decrease in total subscriber churn  from for the year ended december  approximately  subscribers to for the year ended december  approximately  subscribers  due to network and service quality improvements and the continued increase in the number of national and unlimited postpay subscriber plans and other program improvements in the increase in wholesale revenues for the twelve month comparative periods was driven by increased voice and data usage under the strategic network alliance 
wholesale revenues grew for the year  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our wholesale revenues are derived primarily from the voice usage by sprint nextel customers who live in the strategic network alliance service area home minutes of use  those customers of sprint nextel who use our network for voice 
table of contents services while traveling through the strategic network alliance service area travel minutes of use and data usage by sprint nextel customers who live in or travel through the strategic network alliance service area 
in addition to volume increases experienced on existing cell sites  we have added cell sites within this wholesale service area over the last two years  improving existing service and extending this coverage area 
wholesale pricing reductions under the strategic network alliance went into effect on july  relating to travel minutes of use and data usage in accordance with the annual pricing reset provisions of this wholesale agreement 
the impact of the july pricing reductions was more than offset by increased usage 
on july   we entered into an amended and restated resale agreement agreement with sprint spectrum l 
p  which became effective as of july  the agreement supersedes and replaces the original resale agreement and extends the term of the original resale agreement  commits us to perform network upgrades and changes pricing structures  including the addition of revenue minimum guarantees 
under the terms of the agreement  we are committed to upgrading our wireless network to ev do in the territory covered by the agreement 
relative to this upgrade  we are required to be complete by january  and complete by january  failure by us to achieve these deadlines will constitute an event of default and may give sprint nextel the right to terminate the agreement 
we currently expect that the upgrade will be completed by mid year beginning in july  we are guaranteed a minimum monthly revenue of million and  upon achieving completion of the network upgrade to ev do  the monthly minimum increases to million 
the term of the agreement was extended four years over the resale agreement  to july   subject to automatic three year extensions unless certain notice provisions are exercised 
the agreement prohibits sprint nextel from directly or indirectly commencing construction of  contracting for or launching its own wireless communications network in the agreement territory until months prior to end of the agreement 
the agreement specifies a series of usage rates for various types of services 
the voice rate pricing under the agreement is fixed through july   at rates comparable to the rates in the resale agreement  but provides for greater volume discounts in the future to provide incentives for the migration of additional traffic onto the network 
after july   the voice rates will be reset semi annually based on sprint nextel s voice revenue yield 
generally  the data rate pricing is lower under the agreement compared to the rates agreed to in the resale agreement in recognition of the significant growth experience in data usage and anticipated growth from the introduction of higher speed data services as a result of the network upgrade and to also provide incentives for the migration of additional traffic onto the network 
data rates for sprint nextel in market home subscribers are on a per subscriber basis 
the data rate for sprint nextel customers that are traveling through the territory covered by the agreement and use the network are on a per kilobyte basis  reset quarterly beginning july  the strategic network alliance also permits our ntelos branded customers to access sprint nextel s national wireless network at reciprocal rates as the sprint nextel travel rates 
wireline communications revenues wireline communications revenues increased million over the comparative years 
rlec revenues 
rlec revenues  which include local service  network access  toll service  directory advertising and calling feature revenues from our rlec customers  increased million over the comparative years despite a access line decrease  with lines totaling approximately  as of december  compared to approximately  as of december  the revenue increase was due primarily to increased access revenues of million  or over the comparative years driven by an increase in carrier access minutes of from the year ended december  to the year ended december  due primarily to growth in usage by wireless carriers 
this increase was offset by a million lump sum cash receipt in september from the universal service administrative company usac pursuant to an fcc order related to our safety net support dispute for the period january through september ntelos telephone company s interstate access rates were subject to a biennial reset on july  the rate reset resulted in a million reduction of this revenue for the year 
we anticipate that continued minute growth will partially offset the net revenue reduction we are experiencing related to this reset 
the access line loss noted above is reflective primarily of residential wireless substitution  second line losses and pbx displacement of centrex lines 
these line losses  to date  do not reflect the introduction of competitive voice service offerings  such as from cable companies or clecs  in our markets 
while still uncertain  we anticipate competitive voice service competition from comcast in certain of our markets to commence in early we expect that this competition will primarily be for residential customers 
we have estimated that our access line losses may be between and in 
table of contents competitive wireline revenues 
competitive wireline revenue increased million in driven by revenues from our key strategic products local services  broadband voice and data services  and high capacity network access and transport services in the competitive wireline segment which grew million  or  over the comparative years  offset by declines in other competitive revenues dial up internet services  switched access and reciprocal compensation 
revenues from broadband  integrated access and metro ethernet services increased million  or  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  due primarily to customer growth of with the broadband products  particularly in the products with higher bandwidth 
revenues from the remaining key strategic products collectively increased million  or  over the comparative years primarily from new circuit additions with carriers and increased customers 
dial up revenue declined million from continued customer erosion  with approximately  fewer customers  or  from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december   with dial up revenues of million for on september   the virginia scc issued a final order in a rulemaking docket that capped clecs intrastate switched access charges  including the access charges of our clecs  at the higher of the clec s interstate switched access charges or the intrastate switched access charges of the ilec or the average of all ilecs providing service in the geographic area served by the clec 
the cap takes effect at the end of a transition period that began on december  and ends on march  as part of that transition  we reduced our clec access rates effective on january  we expect these lower rates to reduce our clec access revenues by a total of million in operating expenses the following table identifies our operating expenses on a business segment basis  consistent with the table presenting operating revenues above  for the years ended december  and year ended december  operating expenses variance variance dollars in thousands wireless pcs wireline rlec competitive wireline total wireline other operating expenses  before depreciation and amortization  accretion of asset retirement obligations  termination of advisory agreements  secondary offering costs and non cash compensation charges depreciation and amortization accretion of asset retirement obligations termination of advisory agreements secondary offering costs n m non cash compensation total operating expenses 
table of contents operating expenses the following describes our operating expenses by segment and on a basis consistent with our financial statement presentation 
the primary drivers of the year over year increases in our operating expenses before depreciation and amortization  accretion of asset retirement obligations  secondary offering costs  termination of advisory agreements and non cash compensation are described in detail by segment as follows wireless communications of the increase in wireless communications operating expenses noted in the table above  increased variable cost of sales and services accounted for million 
as described in the cost of sales and services cos operating expense discussion below  this increase is primarily attributable to increased roaming cos  data and features cos and equipment cos 
we expect continued growth in these expenses as our customer base grows  sales of national plans increase and usage of data features increases 
the remaining operating expense increases in wireless communications over the comparative periods were due to increased costs of improving and maintaining our network  combined with direct and indirect costs of sales and services expenses 
specifically  cell site expenses increased million related to additional capacity due to the increased subscriber base and a increase in the number of cell sites in service from december  to december  also increasing was customer retention associated with increased wireless pcs customer additions between the comparative periods  existing customer handset upgrades and the increased subscriber base 
these costs increased million over the comparative years 
compensation expenses also increased million over the comparative years reflecting inflationary growth in wages and an increase in personnel to support subscriber growth 
wireless communications experienced a million increase in bad debt expense over the comparative years primarily due to an increased level of subscriber revenues and accounts receivable 
the remaining increase is due primarily to increased advertising and marketing expense  professional fees  rent expense  repairs and maintenance expense  license and regulatory fees  collection expense and bank fees primarily related to subscriber and revenue growth 
wireline communications the increase in wireline operating expenses noted in the table above is primarily attributable to increased access expense  which increased million over the comparative years and accounted for of the total increase 
this increase in access expense was due primarily to supporting the growth of the strategic wireline competitive services  particularly broadband voice and data services 
as a percent of the related competitive revenues  competitive access expense declined from to for the years ended december  and  respectively  from improved network utilization 
also contributing to the increases over the comparative periods were increased compensation expenses of million and increased bad debt expense of million 
other as noted in the table above  operating expenses from the corporate and other communication service businesses decreased million over the comparative years primarily due to a decrease of million in advisory fees 
these costs were eliminated after the first quarterly payment in as a result of the termination of our advisory agreements in february the remaining corporate operating expenses increased million over the comparative years  primarily attributable to legal  accounting and other professional expenses 
cost of sales and services cost of sales and services increased million  or  over the comparative years 
roaming cos increased million related primarily to increased sales of national plans and other plans which contain more roaming minutes  partially offset by a decline in roaming rates and in network roaming savings related to continued cell site expansion 
the percentage of subscribers with a national plan increased from as of december  to as of december  data and other features cos increased million over the comparative years consistent with increased data usage 
access and toll cos increased million collectively over the comparative years due to volume from fixed rate plans 
equipment cos increased million over the comparative years due to approximately  more wireless gross customer additions in than  combined with sales of feature rich  more expensive handsets to new customers and upgrades by existing customers 
the remaining increase in cost of sales and services of million  or  is attributable to increased network related expenses  including cell site costs for wireless and wireline transport and access expense  as discussed above  
table of contents and increases in other support expenses  such as rent  repairs and maintenance  utilities  long distance wholesale  insurance  and personnel and contracted labor expenses 
partially offsetting the increase over the comparative periods was a decrease in non cash compensation of million related to the original class a common stock and option instruments held by certain members of operations and engineering management 
in connection with the planned network expansion and enhancements  we are planning an additional to increase in the number of cell sites in accordingly  when these and future cell sites are placed in service  we expect these costs to increase 
additionally  the ev do upgrade will result in us adding additional access expenses for every cell site just prior to their upgrade 
revenue generation related to this upgrade will lag these increased expenses 
customer operations expenses customer operations expenses increased million  or  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this increase is primarily related to the direct costs associated with increased wireless customer additions between the comparative periods and the related increase in the customer base  as discussed above 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to increased bad debt expenses  as described above  and increases in other collection and customer care driven expenses 
the increase over the comparative years was primarily offset by a decrease in non cash compensation expense of million related to the original class a common stock and option instruments held by certain members of sales  marketing and customer care executive management 
corporate operations expenses corporate operations expenses decreased million  or from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this decrease primarily relates to a decrease of million of non cash compensation charges  a decrease in advisory fee charges of million and a million reduction in operating tax reserves based on a favorable ruling from tax authorities  which was refunded in january offsetting these decreases was an increase in compensation expenses of million  or  due primarily to the increase in performance based bonus expense and inflationary wage increases  and an increase of million relating to legal  accounting and other costs associated with the secondary stock offering discussed in the overview section above 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to increases in regulatory fees  other professional fees and sponsorships 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  over the comparative years 
of this increase  million is attributable to accelerated depreciation for the period august  through december  related to g xrtt and other equipment scheduled to be replaced early related to the ev do upgrade discussed below 
this is offset by accelerated depreciation recorded in related to other network upgrades 
amortization expense for our customer relationship intangible related to our strategic network alliance with sprint nextel decreased million over the comparative years related to the re evaluation of the intangible asset s remaining useful life due to the extension of the sprint contract from april to july the remaining decrease of million over the comparative years relates to assets becoming fully depreciated  retired or whose life was extended and future depreciation reduced as they continued in service beyond the original expected life 
as discussed above in the wireless communications revenue section  we entered into the amended and restated contract with sprint spectrum lp which included a requirement for a technological upgrade of the network from g xrtt to ev do technology by in the sprint nextel overlap territory 
additionally  we are also upgrading a majority of our other coverage areas with ev do 
some of the equipment is planned for redeployment to fringe areas of the network or contiguous markets where we own spectrum but currently do not provide service 
in all cases  we will record additional accelerated depreciation on the g xrtt assets as they are planned for disposal prior to their previously planned useful lives 
the total net book value of the related equipment subject to early retirement is approximately million on august   the date we made the decision regarding the technology upgrade 
the expected incremental capital expenditures related to the upgrade to ev do are million 
based on this network upgrade plan  we expect to record approximately million and million of additional depreciation during and  respectively 
accretion of asset retirement obligations accretion of asset retirement obligations is recorded in order to accrete the estimated asset retirement obligation over the life of the related asset up to its future expected settlement cost 
this charge was million for the years ended december  and termination of advisory agreements on february   commensurate with its ipo  the company terminated the advisory agreements  paying a million termination fee on that date 

table of contents other income expenses interest expense on debt instruments decreased million  or  over the comparative years due primarily to the repayment of the floating rate notes in april prior to their repayment  we recorded million of interest on the floating rate notes 
additionally  in the second quarter of  we incurred million and million of interest charges related to the write off of the high yield floating rate notes deferred issuance costs and discount  respectively  when the notes were repaid and a million prepayment penalty recorded as an interest charge related to the second lien term loan repayment 
in addition to the factors causing the decrease in interest expense noted above  interest on our senior credit facilities decreased due to the reduced interest rates associated with the debt refinancing in june where the million second lien credit facility  which bore interest at above the eurodollar rate  was refinanced with a new first lien credit facility bearing interest at above the eurodollar rate 
the blended rate improvement realized from this refinancing is approximately  or a million annual savings at the current level of senior debt 
our swap agreement is not designated as an interest rate hedge instrument for accounting purposes and  therefore  the changes in the fair value of the swap agreement are recorded as a charge or credit to loss gain on interest rate swap 
the fair value of the current interest rate swap agreement of million at december  has been recorded as interest rate swap on the consolidated balance sheets 
the interest rate swap agreement matures in february other income primarily relates to interest income from cash and cash equivalents 
other income totaled million for the year ended december   million lower than the prior year due to lower cash balances after our ipo proceeds were used to repay obligations in the second quarter of we also recorded a gain on sale of investment totaling million during the year ended december  related to the redemption of the rural telephone bank rtb stock in april income taxes income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  representing the statutory tax rate applied to pre tax income and the effects of non deductible  non cash stock based compensation  state minimum taxes and non deductible secondary offering transaction costs 
we expect our recurring non deductible expenses to relate primarily to certain non cash stock based compensation 
the annual amounts of these charges based on equity based awards outstanding as of december  are projected to be approximately million in income tax expense for the year ended december  was million 
the primary permanent differences relate to the effects of non deductible  non cash stock based compensation  non deductible transaction costs and interest cost in excess of internal revenue code defined yields 
our unused net operating losses nols  approximately million  are subject to an annual utilization limitation of million prior to adjustment for realization of built in gains that existed as of the merger 
based on this limitation and the adjustments required for certain built in gains realized during the five year period immediately following our may  merger  we expect to use nols of approximately million per year in through  million in and million per year from through year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview operating revenues increased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  wireless pcs accounted for of this increase  with growth occurring from both subscriber revenues and wholesale revenues 
wireline contributed the remaining revenue increase primarily from minute driven increases in access revenues and increases in key strategic products from the competitive segment  partially offset by declines in revenues of other competitive segment products 
operating income increased million over the comparative years  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  net income decreased million from net income of million for the year ended december  to a net loss of million for the year ended december  included in the net loss for the year ended december  was a charge of million for the termination of advisory agreements and an increase in interest expense of million  primarily due to transaction related charges of million  million of interest on our floating rate notes  which were paid off in april  and significantly lower interest during prior to the refinancing and merger transactions in late february included in net income for the period ended december  was a gain on the interest

in addition  non cash compensation charges were million in and million in finally  income tax expense was million and million for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
operating revenues the following table identifies our operating revenues on a business segment basis for the years ended december  and december   inclusive of ntelos inc s revenues on a business segment basis for the period january  through may  year ended december  operating revenues variance variance dollars in thousands wireless pcs wireline rlec competitive wireline total wireline other total wireless communications revenues wireless communications revenues increased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  due to an increase in our ntelos branded net subscriber revenue of million  or  a million  or  increase in wholesale and roaming revenues  and a million  or  increase in equipment sales revenues 
subscriber revenues reflected subscriber growth of over the comparative years  or  subscribers  from  subscribers as of december  to  subscribers as of december  as of december   postpay subscribers represented of total subscribers  a decline of from as of december  for the comparative years  subscriber revenues reflected the subscriber growth described above and an increase in arpu of  from to for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
the increase in arpu was driven in part by increased data revenue per subscriber which increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  additionally  arpu increased due to the continued increase in higher service rate plans including the national plans 
other subscriber revenue increased related in large part to growth in data services including data bundle packages introduced during the second quarter of gross subscriber additions were higher for  at  than gross subscriber additions of  this increase in gross adds combined with the introduction of more feature rich handsets sold in the period as compared to the period led to an increase in equipment sales revenue of million  or  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  total subscriber churn decreased  from for  subscribers to for  subscribers  due to year over year improvement in both postpay and prepay churn due primarily to an increased take rate of the national plans and other program improvements in the increase in wholesale revenues for the comparative periods was driven by increased voice and data usage under the strategic network alliance 
wholesale revenues grew  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  pricing reductions went into effect on july  and july  relating to travel minutes of use minutes from sprint nextel customers from outside our region and july  relating to data usage in accordance with the annual pricing reset provisions of this wholesale agreement 
similar to this past year  the impact of the july pricing reductions was more than offset by increased usage 
our wholesale revenues are derived primarily from the voice usage or home minutes of use by sprint nextel customers who live in the strategic network alliance service area  those customers of sprint nextel who use our voice services travel minutes of use while traveling through the strategic network alliance service area and data usage by sprint nextel customers who live in or travel through the strategic network alliance service area

based on notification from sprint nextel of its retail yield for voice usage and data usage for  pursuant to the terms of our strategic network agreement  further pricing reductions are expected to go into effect on july  relating to travel minutes of use and  for the first time since entering into the contract in  for home minutes of use 
sprint nextel s proposed data revenue yield is significantly lower than the comparable rate for the prior year

rlec revenues  which include local service  access and toll service  directory advertising and calling feature revenues from our rlec customers increased over the comparative years despite a access line decrease  with lines totaling  as of december  compared to  as of december  revenues for the comparative years increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to an increase in access revenues of million  or  over the respective periods driven by an increase in carrier access minutes of from to due primarily to growth in usage by wireless carriers  coupled with a million lump sum cash receipt in september from the universal service administrative company usac pursuant to an fcc order related to our safety net support dispute for the period january through september our interstate access rates will be subject to a biennial reset reduction on july  the access line loss noted above is reflective primarily of a reduction in centrex lines  a loss of second lines due to migration away from dial up internet access  wireless substitution and the loss of pri lines serving our own and other isp operations within the rlec service area 
these line losses  to date  do not reflect the introduction of competitive voice service offerings  such as from cable companies or clecs  in our markets 
while still uncertain  we do anticipate cable competition from comcast to commence in we have estimated that our access line losses may be between and in  assuming cable competition does occur which would impact rlec revenues  principally from residential consumers
