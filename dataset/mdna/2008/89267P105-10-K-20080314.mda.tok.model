risk factors 
industry background us active trader market an active trader in the united states in equities stocks  etfs and equity and index options has been defined by celent communications in a may research report as one who trades on average at least times per month  or times per year 
celent estimated that there are approximately  active traders under that definition 
celent also defined a broader active trader market  which includes all who trade  on average  at least times per year  and estimates that broader market to include  to  traders 
that research report also offered an estimate of  individuals who trade between and  times per year  and of  individuals who trade  times or more a year 
similarly  a november research report by fox pitt  kelton characterized active equities traders as those who tend to trade from to times a month  with account balances in the  to  range  and who utilize margin to some degree in their trading 
celent s may report estimated that the top of all online securities brokerage accounts celent estimated there to be million online securities brokerage accounts in  of which equals million accounts make up of all trading and margin revenue for retail brokerage firms serving the active trader market 
the most active traders  the  or so who  celent estimated  trade at least  times a year  are often called semi professional or hyper active traders 
these traders are generally considered to be the most profitable portion of the active trader market 
bear  stearns co  in a january equity research report  defined the semi professional market as one whose participants trade  on average  nearly times per day roughly  trades per trader  per year  and estimated the size of that market at the end of to be approximately  traders 
according to the bear stearns report  those  or so semi professional traders made up an estimated of total nyse and nasdaq daily share volume and an estimated of total online trade volume 
the bear stearns report emphasized the importance to this market of multiple asset classes  stating that today  we believe that the biggest focus is on trading multiple asset classes from a single  yet global  platform  and that traders are demanding trading platforms that are capable of connecting them to the cash equities markets  the futures markets  the options markets  and the foreign exchange fx markets  among others 
the november fox pitt  kelton report added that semi professional traders use highly sophisticated software  often engage with higher stakes  and are much more likely to utilize strategies across asset classes beyond just equities and equity options  such as futures and forex  with trading on margin being prevalent 
richard bove  a research analyst for punk ziegel company  went even further in his january  research report  suggesting that the trading of common stock cash equities is no longer a growth business and that the industry is seeking to diversify outside of the equity markets 

table of contents as noted  all of the above mentioned statistics appear to relate solely to equities accounts and equities trade volume  meaning that the futures and forex online trader markets  which are a fraction of the size of the online equities market but are growing  are in addition to the estimates described above 
the vast majority of active traders who trade cash equities and  to a lesser extent  equity and index options  are believed to be with traditional online brokerage firms eg  charles schwab  e trade  fidelity and td ameritrade 
it is generally accepted in the online brokerage industry that to of each large online brokerage firm s customer base consists of active equities traders  and that those active traders are responsible for the vast majority of those firms trades 
accordingly  nearly all of the large online brokerage firms have tried over recent years to acquire electronic brokerage firms or technology  and more sophisticated trading analysis platforms  in order to retain and grow this most valuable segment of their customer bases 
with respect to equity and index options specifically  the retail business participants also include interactive brokers  optionsxpress and thinkorswim 
for retail futures  the larger firms include calyon  the fimat group  mf global formerly man financial and rj o brien each through their own divisions and or their introducing broker networks  and interactive brokers  and retail forex firms in the united states market include fxcm  gain capital  gft and interactive brokers 
we believe an online brokerage firm focused on active traders  in order to maximize its potential for successful market penetration  needs to deliver fast electronic order placement and execution  including both automated and one click manual order placement capabilities state of the art advanced orders capabilities the ability to use various order placement features limits  trailing stops  simultaneous orders  contingency orders  reserve orders  hidden orders  pegged orders  discretionary orders  etc 
intelligent smart order routing to maximize liquidity and help achieve best execution the ability to analyze and trade multiple asset classes equities  equity and index options  futures and forex using the same platform access to most  if not all  major avenues of execution the major ecns  nasdaq market center  superdot  globex  ecbot  the major electronic options exchanges  etc 
strategy testing and strategy automation capabilities  as well as advanced charting and analysis software tools competitive commission pricing structures for equities  equity and index options  futures and forex streaming  real time quotes  including meaningful market depth displays trade desk  customer account and technical support services customer training services tradestation securities offers each of the above mentioned features 
us institutional trader market we see the institutional trader market in the united states  as it relates to potential customer relationships for electronic brokerage firms like tradestation securities  consisting of buy side firms such as certain hedge funds  money managers  commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators  registered investment advisers who use short term trading strategies  and certain proprietary trading desks at large firms 
many believe that buy side institutional traders have become less and less pleased with wall street traditional sell side brokerage firms and are moving  to one degree or another  towards using execution 
table of contents management systems ems s to execute themselves their portfolio managers trading decisions 
the january bear stearns report states that the impact of financial technology on the securities markets cannot be understated  noting that the technologies originally developed to give the day trader the ability to trade with professionals is now  ironically  being targeted at institutional customers by most brokerage firms 
institutional trading currently represents a small percentage of the company s brokerage revenues and we do not expect significant revenue or account growth in this market in the foreseeable future unless we successfully acquire  or establish a successful strategic licensing or joint venture relationship with  an established ems brokerage firm or technology 
non us markets we believe there are market opportunities outside of the united states for tradestation at both the retail and institutional level 
we believe that opportunities with individual active traders  particularly in futures markets  exist in germany  italy and the pacific rim 
we believe that to compete fully and effectively for active traders in those markets  a trading platform needs to be connected to local or regional exchanges for both market data and order placement and execution  and there needs to be language translations of user materials  acceptance of local currencies to fund accounts  and local customer and technical support 
however  we also believe there may be a smaller retail market in these countries and regions that will be attracted to tradestation to trade on us futures exchanges  mainly the cme  and major forex currency pairs  without as much need for translation or local support or the ability to use their own currencies to fund accounts 
we plan  through both the efforts of our tradestation europe limited subsidiary  independent agents in local markets and potential strategic partnerships  to begin to penetrate these markets 
steps we are taking  once completed  to add eurex and euronext liffe futures markets are expected  along with our current cme and cbot offerings  to increase the attractiveness of our futures offering in europe 
we also believe tradestation is attractive to certain proprietary trading desks at large financial institutions headquartered outside of the united states that focus on rule based trading of some of the us markets that we currently offer  where the trading decisions and executions are made by the same persons or a small  close group working together 
these desks will often use tradestation on a give up basis for futures trading and a delivery versus payment receipt versus payment dvp rvp basis for equities  with settlement and clearing of the transactions remaining with their prime brokers 
we also believe that our forex offering  which is an international market  can have appeal to forex traders worldwide if we can offer accounts that may be funded in local currencies or an otherwise acceptable currency exchange mechanism for customer accounts 
given our belief that we need to add local and regional market data and order execution to increase substantially the appeal of our offering to markets outside the us  our success in these markets will  in part  be determined by the quality and timing of these enhancements  which  in turn  will depend on the speed with which we are able to increase our product development and other needed resources and the priorities we assign to those resources to focus on the us market relative to non us markets 
products and services overview tradestation our main product service offering is the tradestation electronic trading platform for self directed  active  including semi professional  traders and certain segments of the institutional buy side trader market 
tradestation does not provide investment or trading advice or recommendations  or recommend the use of any particular strategy  but rather enables the trader to design  test  optimize and automate his own  custom trading strategies 
tradestation is a registered trademark in the united states  australia  canada  the european union  indonesia  korea  singapore  south africa and taiwan 

table of contents in addition to offering the tradestation electronic trading platform to the brokerage customers of our tradestation securities subsidiary  we offer  through our tradestation technologies subsidiary  tradestation subscriptions 
the difference between the tradestation electronic trading platform and the tradestation subscription service is that the subscription service does not include order execution or account management capabilities 
tradestation has  since its initial release as a strategy trading software program in  been our flagship product 
from until october it was marketed worldwide to institutional traders on a monthly subscription basis by telerate  inc as a premium tool for the telerate data feed service 
it has also served  and continues to serve  as a strategy trading platform for numerous third party trading software applications 
its state of the art technology empowers the trader to design and develop a rule based trading strategy based upon the trader s objective rules and criteria  test the potential profitability of that trading strategy against historical data  and then computer automate it to monitor the applicable market and alert the trader in real time or instantaneously place the trade order when the criteria of the trading strategy have been met and an order should  therefore  be placed 
the principal features of tradestation that enable the trader to design and develop trading strategies are easylanguage and the powereditor 
easylanguage is a proprietary computer language we developed consisting of english like statements and trading terms which can be input by the trader to describe particular objective rules and criteria 
the powereditor is a compiler of easylanguage statements that provides the trader with considerable flexibility to modify and combine different trading rules and criteria  which ultimately result in the design of the trader s trading strategies 
easylanguage and powereditor are also registered trademarks 
brokerage services tradestation securities principal offering today is online brokerage services covering equities principally stocks and etfs  equity and index options  financial and commodities futures principally electronic financial futures contracts  such as e mini s and futures options  and spot forex transactions through the tradestation electronic trading platform 
tradestation securities targeted customer base for brokerage services includes active  including semi professional  traders and certain institutional traders  such as hedge funds  money managers  investment advisors and proprietary trading desks who use short term trading strategies  where the decision maker is also the person placing the trade orders 
in addition to providing online services through the tradestation electronic trading platform  the brokerage firm offers personal support services by its registered trade desk representatives who execute customers orders through electronic order execution systems if the customer is for some reason unable or unwilling to place the order using his or her own computer 
having or using an electronic order execution system  whether accessed directly by the brokerage customer through the tradestation electronic trading platform or by a tradestation securities broker on behalf of the brokerage customer  means that both the online services and the firm s trading desks are connected to electronic equities  equity and index options  futures and forex market centers  market makers or dealers 
this system often results in the simplest  most direct and speediest execution of orders at the best available price 
with respect to pit traded futures contracts  tradestation is directly connected to its futures clearing agent s online execution system  which sends the order directly to the trading pit 
approximately of the company s futures trades are on the electronic futures exchanges 
with respect to forex deals  the tradestation electronic trading platform is seamlessly connected to a third party forex dealer s system for the placement of forex orders directly from the tradestation platform 

table of contents tradestation securities self clears for its active trader equity securities accounts  including stock  etf  and equity and index option trades 
institutional accounts for equity securities and futures are carried on a fully disclosed basis by the brokerage s clearing agents or are given order execution services on a dvp rvp basis for equities  or a give up basis for futures  in either case with the orders cleared and settled by the client s prime brokerage firm 
all individual futures accounts are also carried on a fully disclosed basis by the brokerage s futures clearing agent 
for forex deals  an unaffiliated forex dealer firm acts as principal counterparty for  and clears  all deals with the company s forex customers 
tradestation securities executes or delivers for execution its customers securities  futures and forex transactions on an agency basis only  as opposed to a principal basis 
that is  it acts as the agent for its customers directly in the market 
when brokerage firms perform transactions on a principal basis  they are permitted to accept a customer s order to purchase  purchase the securities in the market for the brokerage firm  and then sell the securities to the customer  or otherwise act as counterparty to the customer s transaction 
tradestation securities does not do this 
it charges only an agreed upon commission and does not earn income from marking up or marking down  or sharing in spreads relating to  its customers securities  futures or forex transactions 
software products and services in december  we launched the tradestation electronic subscription service which replaced the electronic subscription services we had been offering since our october acquisition of window on wallstreet 
the tradestation electronic subscription service includes our award winning strategy trading features and functions  streaming real time charts and quotes  streaming news  state of the art analytical charting  and all other features included in the tradestation electronic trading platform other than trade order placement and other trading or brokerage related features or services 
effective may   the tradestation electronic subscription service was offered to new subscribers at the monthly rate of and to legacy customers who had upgraded at a monthly rate of 
we evaluate our approach to subscription fee pricing on an ongoing basis 
tradestation both as a subscription service and as a brokerage account trading platform also offers our optionstation and radarscreen functions and features 
optionstation  also an award winning technology  is an options trading analysis product for equity  index and futures options that enables traders to explore options trading strategies 
radarscreen enables traders to scan securities markets to identify potential buying or selling opportunities based upon the traders own trading strategies 
we ceased marketing our legacy software products in may and ceased marketing our subscription software services in december accordingly  in  and and  we expect  for the foreseeable future  our brokerage operations produced and should continue to produce most of our revenues 
in  and  revenues from brokerage services consisting primarily of brokerage commissions and fees and net interest income accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total consolidated net revenues  and software products and services accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total consolidated net revenues over that three year period 
sales and marketing our marketing in consisted principally of print advertising in active trader  futures  sfo  and technical analysis of stocks commodities magazines  direct mail and e mail  sales seminars  banner and keyword search advertising on financial web sites  our web sites  and television advertising on financial news channels 
the mix and frequency of television  print  web site  direct mail and in person marketing methods that we use to try to achieve results will likely be continually modified as we test and use such methods and mixtures and analyze and interpret the results 

table of contents revenues derived from customers outside of the united states for the years ended december   and  were approximately  and less than  respectively 
international revenues are collected in us dollars 
we conduct no marketing  sales or other operations  and maintain no assets  outside of the united states  other than relating to our operations in london via our united kingdom subsidiary  tradestation europe limited 
strategic relationships clearing services 
our brokerage firm s clearing services for institutional securities accounts  and for all futures accounts  are currently provided by bear  stearns securities corp 
and rj o brien associates  inc  respectively  pursuant to industry standard clearing agreements 
our server farms have direct connectivity with all major us equities  options and futures exchanges  so we do not  except in limited cases  such as futures pit trading  use our clearing firms for execution services 
forex deal services 
our forex deal services are currently provided through an arrangement with gain capital group  inc forex customers design  test  optimize and automate their forex strategies  including the placement of their orders  using tradestation  then  when a deal order is placed  gain capital s electronic dealer system processes the order and gain capital acts as counterparty principal with respect to the execution and clearing of each forex deal 
technology development we believe that our success depends  in large part  on our ability to offer unique  internet based trading technologies with state of the art order execution technologies  and continuously enhance those technologies  as well as develop and implement well designed and user friendly web sites 
to date  we have relied primarily on internal development of our products and services 
we currently perform all quality assurance and develop user education and other training materials internally 
in  and  technology development expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   our technology development team was comprised of people  as compared to as of december   a increase 
we plan to increase our technology development headcount significantly in  but there can be no assurance that we will succeed in significantly increasing our product development headcount or that  if we do  such increase will result in better products  services or performance financial and otherwise by the company 
we view our technology development cycle as a four step process to achieve technological feasibility 
the first step is to conceptualize in detail the defining features and functions that we believe our targeted market requires from the product or service  and to undertake a cost benefit analysis to determine the proper scope and integration of such features and functions 
once the functional requirements of the product or service have been determined  the second step is to technically design the product or service 
the third step is the detailed implementation  or engineering  of this technical design 
the fourth step is rigorous quality assurance testing to ensure that the final product or service generally meets the functional requirements determined in the first step 
several refinements are typically added and tested in the quality assurance phase of development 
once this process is completed  technological feasibility has been achieved and the working model is available for release to our customers 

table of contents the market for strategy trading software tools  streaming real time market data and news services  and online order execution services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards in computer hardware  software architecture  programming tools and languages  operating systems  database technology and information delivery systems  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements  as well as technical consolidation of products and services 
our success will depend  in part  upon our ability to develop and maintain competitive technologies and to develop and introduce new products  services and enhancements in a timely and cost effective manner that meets changing conditions such as evolving customer needs  existing and new competitive product and service offerings  emerging industry standards  changing technology  and increased capacity and stability requirements as we grow our business and as minimum customer acceptability standards for capacity and stability increase in our industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop  introduce and market  on a timely basis  if at all  products  services or enhancements that respond to changing market conditions or that will be accepted by customers 
any failure by us to anticipate or to respond quickly or effectively to changing market conditions  or any significant delays in the introduction of new products and services or enhancements  could cause customers to delay using  or decide against the use of  our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
customer services and support and training we provide customer services and support and product use training in the following ways customer services and support 
telephone account and technical support service is provided to brokerage customers through a trained customer service team 
advanced easylanguage consulting services services that technically assist customers in the use of easylanguage to write the customers own trading strategies are available from internal resources and from unaffiliated  independent easylanguage consultants 
a substantial amount of technical support information is also provided on our web sites 
in the first three quarters of  tradestation suffered increased account attrition due  in part  we believe  to customer service and support levels that required improvement 
in response  the company made some changes in departmental management and initiated certain customer service and customer retention improvements 
we believe that  as a result of these steps taken  account attrition improved in the fourth quarter and will continue to improve in the first and second quarters as compared to the account attrition peak reached in the third quarter of 
however  there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue and it is possible that account attrition will increase in the third and or fourth quarters 
product use training 
we consider user education important to try to help our customers increase their abilities to use our products and services fully and effectively  and to improve customer account retention 
the majority of our training materials consist of extensive online documentation and technical assistance information on our web sites  including online tutorials  as well as in person training seminars  so that our customers may learn to use and take full advantage of the sophisticated technology of the tradestation electronic trading platform 
the tradestation 
com support center includes access to an interactive community for active traders who engage or have interest in the development  testing and use of objective trading strategies 
the community provides numerous discussion forums on a variety of topics related to strategy development and technical trading  as well as tradestation product and service features  articles about trading from industry leaders  and a library of strategy indicators  rules and components written in our proprietary easylanguage  many of which are donated by third parties 

table of contents competition the market for online brokerage services is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving  and there appears to be substantial consolidation in the industry in three different ways 
first  there has been over the past several years and continues to be consolidation of three types of services that traditionally were offered separately online brokerage services  real time market data services  and trading analysis software products and services 
with the tradestation electronic trading platform  we have embraced this consolidation by offering all three of these services in a fully integrated  seamless manner 
second  we believe consolidation is occurring in the four major online execution markets for active traders equities  equity and index options  futures and forex meaning that  contrary to specializing in offering services for only one of those market instruments  more and more firms are offering or plan to offer three or four of those services 
with our offering of online trading services for all four of these markets  we have embraced this consolidation as well 
third  as a result of price pressure  unused infrastructure capacity at the largest online brokerage firms  and the desire of the larger firms to acquire sophisticated electronic trading technologies  there have been numerous acquisitions in our industry  mostly by larger firms that are seeking to increase their ability to compete on both quality and price 
we believe that competition  as well as consolidation  will continue to increase and intensify in the future 
we believe our ability to compete will depend upon many factors both within and outside our control  including price pressure  the timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements developed by us and our competitors  our ability to design and support efficient  materially error free internet based systems  market conditions  such as recession and volatility  the size of the active trader market today and in the future  the extent to which institutional traders are willing to use electronic brokerage services offered by firms that have traditionally served mostly retail customers  product and service functionality  data availability and cost  execution and clearing costs  ease of use  reliability  customer service and support  and sales and marketing decisions and efforts 
we face direct competition from several publicly traded and privately held companies  principally online brokerages and futures commission merchants  including providers of electronic order execution services 
our competitors include the many online brokerages currently active in the united states  some of which offer both equities including equity and index option and futures brokerage services  including banc of america investment services  charles schwab co  e trade securities  fidelity brokerage services  interactive brokers  merrill lynch direct  optionsxpress  redi products a division of spear  leeds kellogg which is owned by goldman sachs  scottrade financial services  td ameritrade  thinkorswim and townsend analytics which is owned by lehman brothers 
those brokers currently serve  in the aggregate  more than of existing online securities accounts  and many are focused on attracting and retaining active traders 
the larger firms focus mostly on equities investors 
competitors specifically or heavily focused on equity and index options traders include interactive brokers  optionsxpress and thinkorswim 
firms focused heavily on futures traders include retail divisions and or introducing broker networks of calyon  the fimat group  interactive brokers  mf global formerly man financial and rj o brien  and those heavily focused on retail forex include fxcm  gain capital  gft and interactive brokers 
of all of the competitors or potential competitors named above  interactive brokers appears to be the one that is most  like tradestation  focused on offering sophisticated electronic brokerage services for equities  equity and index options  futures and forex to the active trader market 
even though we have consistently been rated as one of the best online brokerage firms in the united states  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such ratings  be rated that highly in the future  compete effectively with our competitors  adequately educate potential customers about the benefits our products and services provide  retain customers  or continue to offer such products and services 

table of contents many of our existing and potential competitors  which include large  online discount and traditional national brokerages and futures commission merchants  and financial institutions that are focusing more closely on online services  including electronic trading services for active traders  have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base than do we 
further  there is the risk that larger financial institutions which offer online brokerage services as only one of many financial services may decide to use extremely low commission pricing or free trades as a loss leader to acquire and accumulate customer accounts and assets to derive interest income and income from their other financial services 
we do not offer other financial services  and have no plans to do so  therefore  such pricing techniques  should they become common in our industry  could have a material  adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and business model 
generally  competitors may be able to respond more quickly or effectively to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services 
we believe we need to increase our technology development resources to improve the quality of our offering  automate and improve certain account opening and customer support services  and the pace at which we release new features  enhancements  products and services 
there can be no assurance that our efforts in this regard will succeed  or that existing or potential competitors will not develop products and services comparable or superior to those developed and offered by us or adapt more quickly to new technologies  evolving industry trends or changing customer requirements  or that we will be able to timely and adequately complete the implementation  and appropriately maintain and enhance the operation  of our business model 
recently  some of our larger competitors have been adding or emphasizing rule based or strategy trading products and features to the active trader market  including comparison advertisements with our active trader offering 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins  failure to obtain any significant market share  or loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  or that competitive pressures faced by us will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property our success is and will be heavily dependent on proprietary software technology  including certain technology currently in development 
we view our software technology as proprietary  and rely  and will be relying  on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we currently have three formal patent applications pending for the tradestation trading platform  and own a patent that covers product features that have recently been incorporated into tradestation 
with respect to the pending patent applications  there can be no assurance that we will obtain patents broad enough in scope to have value  or obtain them at all 
we also have registered copyright rights in our easylanguage dictionary and documentation and tradestation software 
we have obtained trademark registrations for the tradestation mark in the united states  australia  canada  the european union  indonesia  korea  singapore  south africa and taiwan

since these licenses are not physically signed by the licensees  it is possible their enforceability is limited under certain state laws and the laws of many foreign jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties copy or otherwise obtain  use or exploit our software or technology independently 
policing unauthorized use of our software technology is difficult  and we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software technology exists 
piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem  particularly in international markets and as a result of the growing use of the internet 
in addition  effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in certain countries  including some in which we may attempt to expand sales efforts 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 
there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights 
we do not believe that we are infringing  or that any technology in development will infringe  the intellectual property rights of others 
however  there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted by our competitors or others  and  if asserted  there can be no assurance that they would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that we acquire or license a portion of the software or data included in our products or services from third parties some data and software are licensed from third parties  or market products licensed from others generally  our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon such third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of such acquired or licensed software or data technology 
software patent infringement cases in financial service industries are becoming more frequent  and we may be subject to litigation to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
in the future  litigation will likely be necessary to establish  define  enforce  defend and protect patents  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
any such litigation would likely be costly and divert management s attention  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  which could be expensive  or prevent us from selling our products or services or using our trademarks  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation our brokerage subsidiary  tradestation securities  is subject to extensive securities and futures industry regulation under both federal and state laws as a broker dealer with respect to its equities and equity and index options business and as a futures commission merchant with respect to its futures and forex business 
broker dealers and futures commission merchants are subject to regulations covering all aspects of those businesses  including sales methods  trade practices  use and safe keeping of customers funds and

to the extent tradestation securities solicits orders from customers or makes investment recommendations which it currently does not  it is subject to additional rules and regulations governing  among other things  sales practices and the suitability of recommendations to its customers 
tradestation securities mode of operation and profitability may be directly affected by additional legislation  changes in rules promulgated by the sec  finra  nyse  cftc  nfa  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  dtcc  occ  various securities and futures exchanges  and other self regulatory associations and organizations  and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and laws  particularly any changes focused on online brokerages that target an active trader customer base or market the concepts of rule based trading  strategy trading or trading systems  simulated results from historical tests or paper trading of strategies  or strategy automation 
with respect to active trading  finra has adopted rules that require firms to provide customers with a risk disclosure statement about active trading 
further  finra and nyse s margin rules impose more restrictive requirements for pattern active traders 
governmental concern is focused in two basic areas that the customer has sufficient trading experience and that the customer has sufficient risk capital to engage in active trading 
a minimum equities account balance of  is required 
tradestation securities customer account documentation specifies that being an equities brokerage customer of tradestation securities is only for traders who have experience in active trading  are willing to risk considerable amounts of capital at least  and are interested in engaging in high risk  short term  speculative trading activity 
we believe our brokerage firm s minimum account opening requirements  as well as the extensive user education documentation and tutorials offered on our web site  are consistent with both the letter and the spirit of current rules and regulations concerning active trading 
with respect to the use of investment analysis software tools generally  and simulated performance reports of trading systems or strategies in particular  finra  the nfa and nyse have specific rules regarding how a broker dealer or futures commission merchant may market those tools to the public and to existing clients

if a firm fails to maintain the required net capital it must cease conducting business and  if it does not do so  it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec or the cftc and suspension or expulsion by finra  nyse or the nfa  and it could ultimately lead to the firm s liquidation 
tradestation securities is registered as a broker dealer in every us state and the district of columbia and it is subject to regulation under the laws of those jurisdictions  including registration requirements and being subject to sanctions if a determination of misconduct is made 
tradestation securities is a member of the sipc 
sipc provides protection of up to  for each securities account brokerage customer  subject to a limitation of  for cash balances  in the event of the financial failure of a broker dealer 
for securities brokerage accounts the custody and trade clearing of and for which are handled by tradestation securities  an excess securities bond through hsbc insurance brokerage limited  as agent of lloyd s of london  provides protection for any loss of securities and or cash in excess of primary sipc protection  up to million in the aggregate and up to million per any one account 
based upon the asset size per account and in the aggregate of tradestation securities securities account customer base as of the date of this report  this excess sipc protection  combined with primary sipc protection  should be adequate to cover the loss of of those customer assets in the unlikely event that tradestation securities experienced financial failure and all customer assets were somehow lost 
to the extent tradestation securities clears its securities brokerage transactions through bear  stearns securities corp 
which  currently  it does only for institutional accounts  bear  stearns has obtained an excess securities bond that provides protection for any loss of securities and or cash in excess of the primary sipc protection 
neither sipc nor excess sipc coverage applies to fluctuations in the market value of securities or any losses other than those directly caused by the financial failure of a securities broker dealer 
sipc does not apply in any manner to futures commission merchants or to futures or forex accounts 
it is possible that other federal or state agencies will attempt to regulate our current and planned online and other electronic service activities with rules that may include compliance requirements relating to record keeping  data processing  other operation methods  privacy  pricing  content  and quality of goods and services as the market for online commerce evolves 
given the continuing growth of the electronic commerce market  federal or state authorities may enact additional laws  rules or regulations  not only with respect to online brokerage services  but to other online services we provide or may in the future provide 
such laws  rules and regulations  if and when enacted  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects

the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key personnel 
departures and additions of personnel  to the extent disruptive  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

table of contents uncertainties  including the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report 
actual results may differ materially from the results suggested in this report 
factors that may cause or contribute to such differences  and our business risks and uncertainties generally  include  but are not limited to  the items described below  as well as those described in other sections of this report  our other public filings and our press releases  conference calls and other public presentations 
there are several factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  which could result in significant volatility in our stock price quarterly revenues and operating results of tradestation group have fluctuated significantly in the past  and our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future 
causes of such significant fluctuations may include  but are not limited to general economic and market factors  including changes in the condition of the securities and futures markets  that affect active trading and brokerage revenues  including trade volume  market volatility  market direction or trends  the level of confidence and trust in the markets  and seasonality summer months and holiday seasons typically being slower periods  further changes in interest rates  most notably the federal funds target rate of interest a significant portion of our revenues is interest income  and recent and expected decreases in short term rates are expected to have a material negative impact on the interest income component of our brokerage revenues  and further decreases or increases could have a further material impact on our interest income since there are relatively few  if any  costs associated directly with interest income  such impacts  if material  will also materially impact our net income and earnings per share  the company s ability or lack thereof  based upon market conditions  the level of success of its marketing and product development and enhancement efforts  product and service quality and reliability  competition including both price and quality of offering competition  which are intense and other factors  to achieve significant  or any  net increases in daily average revenue trades darts  brokerage accounts and brokerage revenues sequentially or year over year for example  tradestation s darts decreased sequentially from second to third quarter in and in  and net revenues decreased sequentially from second to third quarter  and these items may decrease sequentially or year over year in subsequent periods  with respect to net new customer accounts  the company s ability or lack thereof to maintain or increase the rate of quarterly gross account additions and to continue to reduce the rate of quarterly account attrition which has risen in recent quarters but then declined in the fourth quarter  which may not be successful despite the company s recent and planned efforts to improve sales  marketing and customer service and retention methods and practices  and despite the reduction in attrition in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter and the company s expectations that attrition will continue to decrease in the first and second quarter of  market or competitive pressure to lower commissions and fees charged to customers which we have done several times over the years  or to reduce or eliminate monthly platform fees paid by brokerage customers we have  on more than one occasion  materially reduced the trading activity thresholds our brokerage clients need to meet to qualify for a waiver of monthly platform fees  or to reduce interest rates charged to customers for margin loans or to increase the interest rates used to credit customers account cash balances  
table of contents the quality and success of  and potential continuous changes in  sales or marketing strategies which continue to evolve and the timing and success of new product  service or marketing initiatives  technical difficulties  outages  errors and or failures in our electronic and software products  services and systems relating to market data  order execution and trade processing and reporting  and other software or system errors and failures outages or similar system errors have occurred as recently as december and january  any of which could result in a business or legal requirement to issue large credit amounts to customers  loss of accounts  reduced trading activity  loss of or diminished reputation and recognition in the industry  increased monetary costs and diversion of internal resources  regulatory inquiries  fines and sanctions  and other material adverse consequences also  we do not maintain a seamless  redundant back up system to our order execution systems  which could materially intensify the negative consequences described above  the success of our launch of a seamless forex trading platform  acquisitions of businesses  assets  accounts or similar transactions relating to company growth or business strategies  which may significantly impact future financial results  our balance sheet and our cash position depending upon the type and size of any such transaction  the effect of unanticipated increased infrastructure costs that may be incurred as the company seeks to increase its technology development headcount and resources which it intends to do as quickly as possible in and grows its brokerage firm operations  adds accounts and introduces and expands existing and new product and service offerings  or acquires other businesses  pending  potential or unforeseen third party claims or regulatory matters that turn out to be significantly more costly  in terms of both judgment or settlement amounts and legal expenses or the refusal or failure of our insurer to make payments  or fines  than we currently estimate or expect  variations from our expectations with respect to hiring and retention of personnel we intend  for example  to hire several additional people in technology development  sales and marketing expenditures  technology development costs  compliance costs  or other expense items  the ability to collect unsecured accounts receivable that may arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business or otherwise  costs  material shifts in cash requirements and or adverse financial consequences that may occur with respect to clearing organization  clearing agent and or exchange requirements  or regulatory issues  including exchange  clearing agent or clearing organization cash deposit requirements  reserve and settlement requirements and other financial requirements  if revenues are lower than budgeted expectations  the negative effects of such lower revenues to our bottom line  including our inability to make in a timely fashion commensurate expense reductions as a large amount of our expenses are fixed expenses  ie  do not vary with revenues in the short term  
table of contents the size and frequency of any trading errors or unsecured brokerage account debit balances for which we may ultimately suffer the economic burden  in whole or in part including losses from third party claims that may arise from time to time since june   we have not carried errors or omissions insurance for third party claims  the appeal of our products and services to markets outside of the united states principally europe  given our lack of experience selling to markets outside of the united states  our success or lack of success in developing or enhancing products or services that may be more attractive to non us traders  and the costs  including sales  marketing  compliance  administrative and development  that may be required to improve our chances of success in those markets and our willingness to make those cost commitments or prioritize the use of our resources to focus more on those markets  and or the effect of any decision to suspend or terminate the company s current share buyback plan or a decision to put in place additional share buyback plans or programs 
conditions in the securities and financial markets may affect our rates of customer acquisition  retention and trading activity our products and services are  and will continue to be  designed for customers who trade actively in the securities and financial markets 
to the extent that interest in active trading  or trading generally  decreases due to low trading volumes  lack of volatility  significant downward movement in the securities or financial markets  or negative market sentiment  or future tax law changes  recessions  depressions  wars  terrorism including cyberterrorism  or otherwise  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be materially  adversely affected 
unfavorable market conditions have  historically  seemed to severely negatively impact the share price of publicly held online brokerage firms  and also usually result in more losses for our customers  which could result in increases in quantity and size of errors or omissions or other claims that may be made against us by customers 
we do not currently carry any errors or omissions insurance that might cover  in part  some of those potential claims 
see the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers below 
decreases in short term interest rates or in our customer account balances reduce our interest income  which is a significant component of our brokerage revenues  net revenues and net income we derive a significant portion of our brokerage revenues from interest income on customers credit balances and account borrowings 
therefore  changes in interest rates or in the size of such balances and borrowings  depending upon the extent of the change  could materially change  positively or negatively depending upon the direction of the change the amount of our interest income 
recent and expected decreases in the federal funds target rate of interest have had  and are expected to continue to have  a negative impact on our interest income and  therefore  our brokerage revenues  net revenues and net income 
our business outlook for assumes that the federal funds target rate of interest will not fall below in while we believe this represented the consensus prediction of market analysts at the time we published our business outlook  there are several experts who believe the rate may decrease to as low as by the end of if the rate does decrease further  below our assumptions  that would result in additional negative impact  and could result in our business outlook estimates of net revenues and earnings per share being significantly higher than actual results  even if all other assumptions turned out to be correct which  of course  is unlikely 

table of contents our industry is intensely competitive  which makes it difficult to attract and retain customers the markets for online brokerage services  trading software tools  and real time market data services are intensely competitive and rapidly evolving  and there has been substantial consolidation of those three products and services in the industry  as well as consolidation of the types of financial instruments equities  equity and index options  futures and forex offered by firms 
there has also been consolidation of online brokerage firms generally  as well as intense price competition 
we believe that competition from large online and other large brokerage firms and smaller brokerage firms focused on active traders  as well as consolidation  will continue 
recently  some of our larger competitors have been adding or emphasizing rule based or strategy trading products and features to focus more on the active trader market  including comparison advertisements with our active trader offering 
competition may be further intensified by the size of the active trader market  which is generally thought to be comprised of less than of all online brokerage accounts 
we believe our ability to compete will depend upon many factors both within and outside our control 
factors outside of our control include price pressure on transactional commissions  monthly platform fees and interest rates offered to customers for both credit balances and account borrowings  the timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements developed by our competitors including strategy back testing and automation capabilities  market conditions  such as recession  the size of the active trader market today and in the future  data availability and cost  and exchange and third party execution and clearing costs 
factors over which we have more control  but which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties with respect to our ability to effectively compete  include timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements we develop  our ability to meet changing market demands for a unified  integrated trading platform that offers customers the ability to trade and manage portfolios containing multiple asset classes  our ability to design  improve and support materially error free and sufficiently robust internet based systems  ease of use of our products and services  reliability of our products and services  and pricing decisions and other sales and marketing decisions and efforts 
if rule based trading  which is the core of our brokerage service offering and selling proposition  turns out not to be as attractive to online traders as we think it will  our growth opportunities would likely be limited the foundation of our company and its growth and success to date has  we believe  been based on one core proposition  which is self directed active and serious traders are attracted to the concept of using computer software technology to use rule based or strategy trading techniques to make their trading decisions  and that the attraction to  and acceptance of  this concept by the active trader market will grow significantly over time 
if it turns out that such attraction and acceptance does not significantly grow over time  or diminishes  the size of our target market may turn out to be relatively small and  therefore  our opportunities for growth could be very limited 
attrition of customer accounts and failure to increase the rate of growth of gross new account additions could materially adversely affect our operating results 
beginning in  as a result we believe of strategic marketing initiatives in the form of price reductions implemented near the end of  we increased substantially our rate of quarterly gross customer account additions  which was accompanied by an increase in quarterly account attrition 
however  while we have generally maintained the rate of growth of our quarterly gross account additions throughout and  our account attrition continuously increased over the first nine months of  and peaked in the third quarter of due  in part  we believe  to customer service and support levels that required improvement 
we had implemented earlier in and are continuing to implement marketing and sales  and customer service and retention  plans and 
table of contents programs designed to maintain or increase gross account additions and reduce attrition 
our customer account attrition decreased  and our net accounts increased  in the fourth quarter  and we expect customer account attrition to be lower than the third quarter in the first and second quarters of however  if we are not in future periods able to maintain or increase the rate of quarterly gross customer account additions and reduce the rate of customer account attrition despite our continuing efforts to improve sales  marketing and customer service and retention methods and practices  our recurring revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected 
if we are unable to accelerate or otherwise improve our technology development schedule with respect to release or launch dates of planned product and service initiatives and enhancements  the quality of our products and services and competitiveness in the active trader market may decline we currently have several technology development projects and initiatives in progress to launch new or enhanced features  products and services we believe will increase and improve the quality of our offering  our competitiveness in the marketplace  our ability to penetrate further the active trader market in the us and abroad and certain segments of the buy side institutional trader market  and customer retention 
we believe it is important to accelerate or otherwise improve the currently planned release dates of these products and initiatives and  toward that end  are seeking to increase our technology headcount in despite our efforts  it is difficult to quickly hire qualified technology personnel who will be able to make significant positive contributions in the short term  and  if we fail to increase adequately or otherwise use effectively and efficiently our technology development resources to complete and launch these projects and initiatives  we may lose market share or suffer other material  adverse consequences 
our systems and our customers accounts may from time to time be vulnerable to security risks that could disrupt operations  harm our reputation and expose us to potential liability our online electronic trading platform includes security features that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of customer accounts 
despite these security features  our systems and our customers accounts may from time to time be vulnerable to security risks such as break ins and similar problems caused by third parties 
we have recently experienced occurrences of unauthorized intrusion and criminal activity in customer accounts by persons who unlawfully access customer accounts and then place orders or other transactions in those accounts 
although we have taken measures and are in the process of completing measures to limit or prevent similar occurrences in the future  no assurance can be made that any such measures will be successful or that future occurrences will not result in substantial account losses that will ultimately be borne by us 
such intrusions and other disruptions could also disrupt our operations  harm our reputation and subject us to potential liability 
systems failures may result in our inability to deliver accurately  on time  or at all  important and time sensitive services to our customers the online electronic trading platform we provide to our customers is based upon the integration of our sophisticated front end software technology with our equally sophisticated  internet based server farm technology 
our server farm technology is the foundation upon which online trading customers receive real time market data and place buy and sell orders 
however  in order for this technology to provide a live  real time trading platform  it requires integration with real time market data  which are currently provided directly by the exchanges or by systems of independent third party market data vendors who obtain the data directly from 
table of contents the exchanges  the electronic order book systems of ecns and electronic systems offered by the exchanges  the clearing and back office systems we license from sungard for self clearing and of the clearing agents we use for trades that we do not self clear  and the forex deal order placement  settlement and back office systems of or licensed to the forex dealer firm which is responsible for all of our customers forex trades 
accordingly  our ability to offer a platform that enables the development  testing and automation of trading strategies and the placement  execution  clearing and settlement of buy and sell orders depends heavily on the effectiveness  integrity  reliability and consistent performance of all of these systems and technologies 
in particular  the stress that is placed on these systems during peak trading times could cause one or more of these systems to operate too slowly or fail 
outages and other system failures may also be caused by natural disasters and other events and circumstances beyond our control 
we have experienced several delays and outages since we launched our online trading platform  many of which related to data vendor  clearing agent  exchange and ecn outages or issues which are beyond our control 
there have also been several market data and order execution outages recently  as well as failures to perform on our part and on the part of the brokerage firm s back office system vendor 
any major system failure or outage or series of frequent failures or outages  regardless of the cause  could result in a business or legal requirement to issue large credit amounts to customers  loss of accounts  reduced trading activity  loss of or diminished reputation and recognition in the industry  increased monetary costs and diversion of internal resources  regulatory inquiries  fines and sanctions  and other material adverse consequences 
also  we do not maintain a seamless  redundant back up system to our order execution systems  which could materially intensify these negative consequences 
additionally  as a general matter not applicable only to our company  the integrity of these types of systems may be attacked by persons sometimes referred to as hackers who intentionally introduce viruses or other defects to cause damage  inaccuracies or complete failure 
also  cyberterrorism  should it occur  may significantly affect people s willingness to use internet based services  particularly ones that involve their personal or company s assets 
see our systems and our customers accounts may from time to time be vulnerable to security risks that could disrupt operations  harm our reputation and expose us to potential liability above 
during a system outage or failure  our brokerage may be able to take orders by telephone  however  only associates with appropriate licenses  knowledge and experience can accept telephone orders  and an adequate number of associates likely would not be available to take customer calls in the event of a system outage or failure 
system delays  errors  outages and failures  depending upon how serious and how often they occur  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
see the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers below 
the loss of key employees could decrease the quality of our management and operations our success depends to a very significant extent on the continued availability and performance of a number of senior management and product development personnel 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our company 
in particular there may be adverse consequences to the company and or its operations as a result of the recent change in company senior management roles  which included the transition  in early  of william cruz and ralph cruz  the company s co founders and co chairmen  out of their day to day senior management roles as co ceos 
the causes of potential adverse consequences may include changes in management styles or decisions that produce less favorable results than would have been produced under the prior management structure 

table of contents we are exposed to credit risk we make margin loans to clients collateralized by client securities  and borrow securities to cover trades 
in fact  nearly all of our clients accounts are margin  as opposed to cash  brokerage accounts 
a portion of our net revenues is derived from interest on margin loans 
to the extent that these margin loans exceed client cash balances maintained with us  we must obtain financing from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain this financing on favorable terms or in sufficient amounts 
by permitting clients to purchase securities on margin  we are subject to risks inherent in extending credit  especially during periods of rapidly declining markets in which the value of the collateral substantially decreases in proportion to the amount of a client s indebtedness 
while we have implemented additional risk management procedures designed to reduce this risk  there can be no assurance that we will not experience periodic or frequent unsecured account debits that materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  we collateralize borrowings of securities by depositing cash or securities with lenders 
sharp changes in market values of substantial amounts of securities and the failure by parties to the borrowing transactions to honor their commitments could have a material  adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers many aspects of the securities  futures and forex brokerage business  including online trading services  involve substantial risks of liability 
in recent years there has been a high incidence of litigation involving the securities and futures brokerage industry  including both class action and individual suits and arbitrations that generally seek substantial damages  including in some cases punitive damages 
the technology we use and rely upon  in addition to offering charting  trade analysis and trade execution services of various kinds  is designed to automatically locate  with immediacy  the best available price in the appropriate market in completing execution of a trade triggered by programmed market entry and exit rules 
there are risks that the electronic communications and other systems upon which these products and services rely  and will continue to rely  or our products and services themselves  as a result of flaws or other imperfections or limitations in their designs or performance  may operate too slowly  fail  cause confusion or uncertainty to the user  or operate or produce results not understood or intended by the user 
an investor or trader using either our full electronic trading platform or our subscription service might claim that investment or trading losses or lost profits resulted from use of a flawed version of one of our trading software tools or systems  or inaccurate assumptions made by the trading software tools regarding data  or inaccurate data 
major failures of this kind may affect all customers who are online simultaneously 
any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we do not currently carry any errors or omissions insurance that might cover  in part  some of the above described risks 
while our contracts with customers are  we believe  clear that customers who do business with us must knowingly assume all of the risks described above  there can be no assurance that a judge  arbitrator or regulator would enforce or honor such contractual provisions 
see conditions in the securities and financial markets may affect our rates of customer acquisition  retention and trading activity and systems failures may result in our inability to deliver accurately  on time  or at all  important and time sensitive services to our customers above 

table of contents dependence upon outside data sources and clearing relationships creates risks outside of our control which may affect our ability to provide  and our cost to provide  market data and clearing and account services our business is currently dependent upon our ability to maintain contracts with private market and news data vendors and clearing and dealer firms in order to provide certain market data and news  and clearing and account services  respectively  to our customers 
we currently obtain nyse  amex  nasdaq  regional equities exchange  options price reporting authority opra  cme  cbot  new york mercantile exchange commodities exchange nymex comex  new york board of trade nybot  onechicago and eurex futures real time market data directly from those exchanges  and real time market depth displays directly from ecn book services  but obtain other market data such as forex data  fundamental data and news pursuant to non exclusive licenses from private data vendors who in turn obtain the data from exchanges or other sources 
clearing and back office account services for our brokerage customers are obtained from established clearing agents and  with respect to our self clearing operations  our software system licensing agreement with sungard 
for our forex services  we rely on a third party forex dealer firm for all trade activity account services 
the data and news contracts typically provide for royalties based on usage or minimums  the clearing contracts provide for transactional clearing fees and charges  and the contract with the forex dealer provides that we will not share in the spread made by the forex dealer in each deal 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or maintain contracts or acceptable clearing cost or vendor fee rates 
in fact  in we needed to quickly change our futures clearing agent in response to a substantial increase in our clearing costs imposed by our former futures clearing agent 
changes or  in some cases  the failure or inability to make changes in our relationships with one or more of these third parties  or involuntary termination of one or more of those relationships  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we may be subject to intellectual property litigation there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights 
although we do not believe that we are or will be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  there was an infringement claim asserted against us and eight other online brokerage firms by a company named datamize  inc  which could have had a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects if it was successful we settled the suit in december for an amount immaterial to our financial statements 
such a case  as well as any other infringement case that may be brought against us  could result in our being unable to use intellectual property which is integral to our business 
we may not be able to adequately protect or preserve our rights in intellectual property our success is and will continue to be heavily dependent on proprietary technology  including existing trading software  internet  web site and order execution technology  and those types of technology currently in development 
we view our technology as proprietary  and rely  and will be relying  on a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  patent protection  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
we own one patent  and also have pending patent applications covering the tradestation electronic platform  but we do not yet know for certain if the patents will be issued 
policing unauthorized use of our products and services is difficult  however  and we may be unable to prevent  or unsuccessful in attempts to prevent  theft  copying  infringement or other unauthorized use or exploitation of our product and service technologies 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect or defend our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies or products and services 

table of contents self clearing equity trades for active trader accounts has risks self clearing operations for our active trader equities accounts stocks and etfs began in september and for equity and index options trades began in march prior to the september conversion of clearing services  all of our customers equities trades were cleared through bear stearns  as our clearing agent  which also provided to our active trader clients its short sale borrowing inventory 
errors made by us related to the confirmation  receipt  settlement and delivery functions involved in securities transactions  the custody and control of client securities and other assets  or otherwise relating to the handling of our clients securities and funds  could lead to civil penalties and increased deposit and other requirements by governmental and self regulatory organizations  as well as losses and liability in lawsuits relating to client accounts affected by such errors 
also  our savings from self clearing may be more than offset by account losses or reduced trading activity if we experience difficulties in providing to our clients sufficient short sale borrowing inventory or if any self clearing mistakes or failures occur which undermine our customers or prospects confidence in our ability to conduct reliable self clearing operations 
also  our self clearing back office operations rely on the phase self clearing software licensed to us by sungard  and our business would likely suffer substantial harm if that software fails  fails to be adequately supported by sungard  or otherwise causes unintended results 
operation in a highly regulated industry and compliance failures may result in severe penalties and other harmful governmental or sro actions against us the securities and futures industries are subject to extensive regulation covering all aspects of those businesses 
regulation of forex dealer and brokerage services is increasing as well 
the various governmental authorities and industry sros that supervise and regulate our brokerage firm have broad enforcement powers to censure  fine  suspend  enjoin  expel or issue cease and desist orders to our brokerage firm or any of its officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations 
additionally  rules relating specifically to active traders have been enacted and more may be enacted which severely limit the operations and potential success of our business 
for example  about seven years ago  the nyse and finra required brokerage firms to establish systems that enabled them to identify pattern day traders and to ensure that those types of accounts maintained higher minimum account balances and stricter margin maintenance requirements 
in a more recent example  in january new short sale rules promulgated by the sec became effective that could have materially  adversely affected our ability to provide quality short sale brokerage services to our equities brokerage customers 
our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our brokerage s maintenance of compliance and reporting systems  as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other operations personnel and enter into suitable contractual relationships with appropriate vendors  lenders and counterparties 
we currently have a pending issue relating to short interest that could have negative consequences for our brokerage 
in general  our brokerage could be subject to disciplinary or other regulatory or legal actions  fines and penalties in the future due to noncompliance 
there are risks relating to our ability to maintain customer privacy and security and that increased government regulation of internet business may occur customers may refuse to transact business over the internet  particularly business  such as ours  that involves the handling of significant amounts of customers funds  due to privacy or security concerns 
this risk will grow if  as and to the extent 
table of contents cyberterrorism occurs or is perceived to be a viable  prominent threat or likelihood to occur or recur on a regular basis 
we do incorporate security measures into our privacy policies 
however  no assurances can be made that a breach of such measures will not occur  and a major breach of customer privacy or security could have serious consequences for our internet based operations  which are central to our business 
use of the internet  particularly for commercial transactions  may not continue to increase as rapidly as it has during the past few years as a result of privacy or security concerns  or for other reasons 
if this occurs  the growth of our operations would be materially hindered 
if internet activity becomes heavily regulated in these respects or otherwise  that could also have significant negative consequences for the growth of our current and planned operations 
see our systems and our customers accounts may from time to time be vulnerable to security risks that could disrupt operations  harm our reputation and expose us to potential liability above 
we may need cash in the foreseeable future while we anticipate having sufficient cash to meet our needs over the next months  our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the rate of customer acceptance of our products and services  including the number of new brokerage accounts acquired and the number and volume of trades made by our brokerage customers  the use of cash in acquisitions or other strategic ventures should any occur  significant  increased infrastructure and operating costs as our business grows through acquisition  joint venture or otherwise  large cash or security deposit requirements which were million as of march   and which are expected to increase as our business grows  and increased net capital or excess net capital requirements and unanticipated reserve and settlement requirements 
funds  if and when needed  may be raised through debt financing and or the issuance of equity securities  there being no assurance that any such type of financing on terms satisfactory to us will be available or otherwise occur 
debt financing must be repaid regardless of whether we generate revenues  net income or cash flows from our operations and may be secured by substantially all of our assets 
any equity financing or debt financing which requires issuance of equity securities or warrants to the lender would reduce the percentage ownership of the shareholders of the company 
shareholders also may  if issuance of equities occurs  experience additional dilution in net book value per share  or the issued equities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders 
our brokerage must meet net capital and other financial requirements as a broker dealer that  if not satisfied  could result in severe penalties or other negative consequences  and which at all times limit our right to use all of the brokerage s cash the sec  finra  the cftc  the nfa  the dtcc ie  nscc and dtc  the occ  certain exchanges and other regulatory and self regulatory agencies or organizations have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers and futures commission merchants  large  fluctuating cash deposit requirements  and reserve  settlement and other financial requirements 
net capital is the net worth of the regulated company assets minus liabilities  less deductions for certain types of assets as well as other charges 
if a firm fails to maintain the required net capital it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec or cftc and suspension or expulsion by finra or the nfa  and it could ultimately lead to the firm s liquidation 
if such net capital rules are changed or expanded  or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital  operations that require the use of capital would be restricted 
also  our ability to withdraw capital from our tradestation securities brokerage subsidiary is subject to sec rules  which in turn could materially impact our available working capital and materially impact or limit our ability to make acquisitions  repay debt as and when due  redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock  
table of contents if required or desirable  and pay dividends in the future 
a large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our then present levels of business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects

tradestation securities self clears most of its equities and equity options business  and uses an established futures clearing firm and an established forex dealer firm to clear its futures and forex business 
tradestation securities revenues consist primarily of transactional commissions and fees including monthly platform fees and interest derived from customer balances and margin lending to customers 
with respect to monthly platform fees a charge made to less active brokerage customers for being granted access to use the tradestation trading platform  beginning september  we launched a series of strategic marketing initiatives  the most recent as of november   which have reduced materially the trading activity thresholds that need to be met to qualify for a waiver of the monthly platform fee 
effective december   we also launched a strategic marketing initiative designed to attract high volume futures traders a change from our one price fits all futures commission structure to a tiered commission structure that rewards more active traders with lower pricing 
beginning in september  tradestation securities commenced equities self clearing operations for its active trader client base and commenced omnibus clearing of its standardized equity option trades through broadcort  a division of merrill lynch 
beginning march   following issuance of its membership in the occ  tradestation securities commenced full self clearing of its standardized equity options trades for its active trader client base and terminated broadcort s clearing services 
self clearing has provided substantial cost savings and efficiencies 
tradestation securities currently clears institutional account securities trades through bear  stearns securities corp 
on a fully disclosed basis  or provides order execution services on a dvp rvp basis with the orders cleared and settled by the client s prime brokerage firm 
futures trades are cleared through rj o brien associates on a fully disclosed basis and  for certain institutional futures accounts  order execution services are provided on a give up basis with the orders cleared and settled by the client s prime brokerage firm 
forex trades  through july   were cleared through rj o brien foreign exchange and  subsequent to july   through gain capital group  inc  each on a fully disclosed basis bear  stearns securities corp  broadcort  rj o brien associates  rj o brien foreign exchange  and gain capital group  inc are collectively referred to as clearing agents or clearing agent firms 
in an amendment dated as of october   tradestation securities and gain capital extended their agreement to december   and gain agreed to make available to tradestation s forex customers the inside quotes and spreads generally made available to gain s institutional customers that demand or seek the tightest inside spreads per currency pair  in exchange for tradestation s agreement to no longer share those spreads with gain capital 
on march   tradestation and rj o brien extended their agreement to december  the extended term provides for the payment of higher fixed monthly clearing fees for all electronic futures contracts  and incremental per contract clearing fees if tradestation s futures volume reaches a certain level far above its current volume  and continues to provide interest sharing on futures account cash balances substantially similar to the interest sharing arrangement that had been in place 

table of contents effective january   a brokerage account has been defined as an account that either has a positive asset balance of at least or has had activity within the past days 
in other words  an account is deemed inactive and is not included in counting total brokerage accounts if it has less than a balance and has had no activity within the past days 
the effect of this modified account definition was a net positive adjustment of accounts as of january  ie  a positive adjustment to the number of futures and forex accounts exceeded a negative adjustment to the number of equities accounts by 
periods prior to have not been and will not be restated to reflect the modification to the definition 
as of december   tradestation securities had  equities  futures and forex accounts the vast majority of which were equities and futures accounts  a net increase of  accounts  or  when compared to the  accounts as of january  during the year ended december   tradestation securities brokerage customer account base averaged  daily average revenue trades often called darts  an increase of when compared to  during the following table presents certain brokerage metrics and account information for the years ended december  change vs

dec  vs 
dec  dec  jan  dec  jan  client account information total brokerage accounts average assets per account equities average assets per account futures we compute darts as follows for equities and equity and index options  a revenue trade included to calculate darts is a commissionable trade order placed by the customer and executed  regardless of the number of shares or contracts included in the trade order 
for futures and forex  a revenue trade included to calculate darts is one round turn commissionable futures contract traded  or one round turn lot or forex deal traded  regardless of the number of individual orders made and executed ie  one futures or forex order may contain numerous contracts or deals  but each round turn contract and deal is counted as a separate revenue trade 
when viewing our darts  it should be taken into account that  for equities and equity and index options  we charge commissions based on share volume and number of contracts traded and not by revenue trade used to calculate darts 
for futures  we charge commissions on a per contract basis so each futures revenue trade included to calculate darts represents a round turn commissionable contract traded 
it should be noted that all darts are not equal 
the revenue we derive from each revenue trade depends on the asset in question equities  equity and index options  futures  forex each has a different per unit revenue structure and cost structure  and  within each asset class  revenue per equity  contract or deal varies to the extent higher volume traders receive more favorable pricing  which they often do 

table of contents tradestation technologies  the company s other established operating subsidiary  owns all of our intellectual property 
tradestation technologies also provides subscription services for tradestation 
the subscription version of tradestation is an institutional quality service that offers strategy trading software tools that generate real time buy and sell alerts based upon the subscriber s programmed strategies  but does not include order execution 
subscribers are charged a monthly subscription fee 
we also have a united kingdom subsidiary  tradestation europe limited  which is currently in an early phase of operations 
in february  tradestation europe became authorized by the united kingdom s fsa to act as a securities and futures firm in the united kingdom to introduce accounts to tradestation securities 
the fsa category of authorization is isd category d arranger  meaning that tradestation europe may solicit and introduce uk clients who are active  experienced traders to its us affiliate for equities  options  futures and forex account services 
in february  tradestation europe obtained its european passport pursuant to which the company may use its fsa authorization to qualify to conduct similar business throughout the european union 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
brokerage commissions and fees and net interest income brokerage commissions and fees and net interest income are the key components of our results of operations and are comprised mainly of i brokerage commissions and fees earned from securities  futures and forex transactions and  to a lesser extent  monthly platform fees earned from brokerage customers using the tradestation online trading platform  and ii net interest earned and paid from self clearing operations primarily interest earned on brokerage customer cash balances and interest earned from brokerage customer margin debit balances  interest revenue sharing arrangements with clearing agent firms  and interest on corporate cash and cash equivalents 
brokerage commission income and related clearing costs are recorded on a trade date basis as transactions occur 
platform fees are recorded on a monthly basis as services are provided 
interest revenue and interest expense are recorded as interest is earned or incurred 
income taxes we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  effective january  fin clarifies accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also prescribes guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
previously  we had accounted for tax contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
as required by fin  we recognized the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the 
table of contents consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
at the adoption date  we applied fin to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open 
the adoption of fin on january  did not require any cumulative effect adjustments to beginning retained earnings and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
as of january   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of  which was increased to  during the year 
if this tax benefit is recognized in the consolidated financial statements  it would not have a material impact to our effective tax rate because the difference is temporary in nature 
we do not anticipate any significant changes in uncertain tax positions over the next twelve months 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred income tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
management evaluates and determines on a periodic basis the amount of the valuation allowance required and adjusts the valuation allowance as needed 
as of december  and  we had no valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets 
in december  we reversed a valuation allowance of  the result of the  reversal was a reduction to the income tax provision recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the decision to reverse the valuation allowance was triggered by our continued profitability and the accelerated growth of our income before income taxes during the previous four years  as well as the expectation that we will continue to have income before income taxes in future years 
on a periodic basis  we will continue to evaluate our remaining deferred income tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements income taxes for additional discussion of income taxes 
uninsured loss reserves effective june   we decided to no longer carry errors or omissions insurance that covers third party claims made by brokerage customers or software subscribers as a result of alleged human or system errors  failures  acts or omissions 
this decision was made based upon our assessment of the potential risks and benefits  including significant increases in premium rates  deductibles and coinsurance amounts  reductions in available per occurrence and aggregate coverage amounts  and the unavailability of policies that sufficiently cover the types of risks that relate to our business 
we recently reviewed this insurance with insurance agents and our view remains unchanged 
each quarter  we continue to evaluate our accruals  if any  for settlements related to claims and potential claims 
estimates of settlements for such potential claims  including related legal fees  are accrued in the consolidated financial statements  as necessary 
during  we recorded approximately  of expenses primarily as a result of the final resolution of two unreserved customer claims one an arbitration award  one a settlement initiated in prior periods 
as of december   we had recorded  for a tentative settlement with finra regarding its investigation of our oats reporting in prior periods  and such amount was paid in january results of operations for the three years ended december   we operated in two principal business segments i brokerage services  and ii software products and services 
the brokerage services segment primarily represents the operations of tradestation securities and  to a lesser extent  the operations of tradesation europe limited 
the software products and services segment represents the operations of tradestation technologies 
we ceased marketing our legacy software products and subscription software services in 
table of contents as a result  our primary sources of consolidated revenue are currently generated from the brokerage services segment  and the brokerage services segment should continue to produce most of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
for the years ended december   and  the brokerage services segment accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total consolidated net revenues 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of net revenue from the brokerage services segment was derived from equities and standardized equity option accounts 
conversely  for the years ended december    and  approximately  and  respectively  of net revenue from the brokerage services segment was derived from futures and forex accounts 
given the size of the percentage of revenue from the brokerage services segment  other than our discussion and table in note of notes to consolidated financial statements segment and related information  we will discuss our results of operations for the overall company instead of on a segmented basis

net income was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or  due primarily to our year over year increase in net revenues and a lower effective tax rate in  partially offset by a year over year increase in total expenses 
income before income taxes was million of net revenues for the year ended december   as compared to million of net revenues for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
our improvement in income before income taxes was due primarily to our increased brokerage commissions and fees of million and increased net interest income of million  partially offset by increased clearing and execution costs of million and increased employee compensation and benefits of million 
our pre tax margin income before income taxes divided by net revenues decreased from to due primarily to the increase in employee compensation and benefits  which resulted from merit increases and increased employee headcount  and in other fixed costs associated with the growth of the company s infrastructure 
during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million  or of our income before income taxes  as compared with million  or of our income before income taxes  during the year ended december  revenues brokerage commissions and fees brokerage commissions and fees are comprised mainly of commissions for securities  futures and forex transactions and  to a lesser extent  monthly platform and other fees earned from brokerage customers using the tradestation online trading platform or other brokerage services 
for the year ended december   brokerage commissions and fees were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this million  or  increase was due primarily to increased brokerage commissions of million from higher trading volume related primarily to growing our brokerage customer account base and increased market volatility in generally  as market volatility increases our customer accounts trade volume increases and  to a lesser extent  revenue received for providing order flow of equity option trades which began in the first quarter of of million  increased platform and other fees  related to account growth  of million and exchange fee revenue of million resulting from a change in classification as revenue  beginning july   of certain exchange fees previously recorded as an offset to expenses 
this change in classification resulted from the company increasing its fees for certain exchange products in excess of the amount it is charged for such products by the vendors of those data service products 
we continuously review and assess our pricing both commissions and platform fees 
our brokerage commissions and fees in future periods will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to add new accounts and retain existing accounts  market volatility and other market conditions  success or failure of sales and marketing campaigns  and competitive price pressure 
interest income interest income is comprised of interest earned from self clearing operations primarily interest earned on brokerage customer cash balances and interest earned from brokerage customer margin debit balances  interest revenue sharing arrangements with clearing agent firms  and interest on corporate cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
most of our interest income is tied directly or indirectly to the federal funds target rate of interest 
for the year ended december   interest 
table of contents income was million as compared to million for the year ended december  this million  or  increase was due primarily to account growth  partially offset by decreases in the federal funds target rate of interest 
the weighted average rate of interest for equities accounts is based upon the federal funds daily effective rate of interest which is driven by the target rate and the direction the markets believe the target rate will move and  for futures accounts  it is based directly on the federal funds target rate of interest

table of contents involving the execution  settlement and financing of various customer securities and futures transactions 
these customer activities may expose the company to off balance sheet credit risk in the event the customers are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations

tradestation securities provides guarantees to its clearing organization and exchanges under their standard membership agreements  which require members to guarantee the performance of other members 
under the agreements  if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing organization and exchanges  other members would be required to meet shortfalls 
tradestation securities liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the cash and securities it has posted as collateral 
however  the possibility of the company being required to make payments under these arrangements is remote 
accordingly  no liability has been recorded for these potential events
