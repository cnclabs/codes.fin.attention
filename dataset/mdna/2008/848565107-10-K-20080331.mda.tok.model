these statements relate to our future plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
these statements may be identified by the use of words such as may  could  would  should  will  expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  and similar expressions 
our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results and timing described in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those factors described below and above under item a 
risk factors and item business 
readers are encouraged to carefully review those risk factors 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in light of those factors and in conjunction with  our accompanying consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
overview we develop  manufacture and market highly engineered products and services in three principal business areas i capital equipment for the pv solar industry  ii biomedical and iii optoelectronics  generally bringing to bear expertise in materials technologies  surface science and thin films across all three business areas  discussed below 
in the pv solar area  we develop  manufacture and market specialized equipment for the production of terrestrial photovoltaic modules from solar cells 
our equipment has been installed in approximately factories in countries 
in the biomedical area  we provides value added surface treatments to manufacturers of orthopedic and other medical devices that enhance the durability  antimicrobial characteristics or other material characteristics of their products  develops and markets coated and uncoated hemodialysis catheters and related devices for the treatment of chronic kidney disease  and performs sponsored research programs into practical applications of advanced biomedical and biophotonic technologies 
in the optoelectronics area  we provide custom compound semiconductor foundry and fabrication services on a merchant basis to customers involved in biomedical biophotonic instruments  telecommunications and defense applications 
services include compound semiconductor wafer growth  other thin film processes and related device processing and fabrication services 
we also provide materials testing services and perform services in support of sponsored research into practical applications of optoelectronic technologies 
operating results will depend upon revenue growth and product mix  as well as the timing of shipments of higher priced products from our solar equipment line and delivery of solar systems 
export sales  which amounted to of net sales and revenues for  continue to constitute a significant portion of our net sales and revenues 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items as a percentage of net sales and revenues for the periods presented year ended december  net sales and revenues cost of sales and revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses internal research and development expenses gain on sales of trademark loss from operations other expense  net loss before income taxes income tax benefit loss before extraordinary gain extraordinary gain  net of taxes net loss overall our total net sales and revenues for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  
the increase came primarily from our solar business unit  while our optoelectronics business unit achieved a small increase 
solar business unit sales in our solar business unit increased to  in as compared to  in  primarily due to a increase in solar equipment sales resulting from higher volume offset by a decrease in solar systems sales 
biomedical business unit revenues of our biomedical business unit increased to  in as compared to  in  as a result of a increase in revenue from our line of hemodialysis catheters and increase in biomedical services offset by a decrease in revenue from our research and development activities 
optoelectronics business unit sales in our optoelectronics business unit increased in to  as compared to  in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales and revenues the following table categorizes our net sales and revenues for the periods presented year ended december  increase sales of goods    contract research  service and license revenues    net sales and revenues    the increase in sales of goods for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a increase in solar equipment and solar systems revenues  with higher volume being the primary contributor to the increase 
biomedical product sales increased in as compared to as a result of increased demand for our expanded line of hemodialysis catheters 
we introduced a new heparin coated catheter late in the fourth quarter of the increase in contract research  service and license revenues in is primarily attributable to an increase in our optoelectronics business unit 
revenues from optoelectronic services increased in as compared to primarily due to an increase in semiconductor foundry and fabrication services 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in r d and nrel service revenue 
cost of sales and revenues the following table categorizes our cost of sales and revenues for the periods presented  stated in dollars and as a percentage of related sales and revenues caption years ended december  increase 
del cost of goods sold    cost of contract research  service and license revenues  net cost of sales and revenues    del 
cost of goods sold increased in as compared to  primarily as a result of the increase in related revenues 
as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold was of sales of goods in as compared to of sales in this change is due to increased costs in associated with higher levels of revenue along with better utilization of solar manufacturing overhead 
the overall cost of contract research  services and licenses in is up slightly as increased costs at our optoelectronics facility spire semiconductor were somewhat offset by a decrease in costs of our contract research activities due to lower volumes 
spire semiconductor s costs increased primarily due to fixed costs associated with new capital equipment that were brought into service in cost of contract research  services and licenses as a percentage of revenue increased to of revenues in from in  primarily due to the increase in spire semiconductor costs 
cost of sales and revenues also includes approximately  and  of stock based compensation in and  respectively  due to the adoption of sfas r in operating expenses the following table categorizes our operating expenses for the periods presented  stated in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and revenues caption years ended december  increase decrease 
del selling  general and administrative    internal research and development   operating expenses    del 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased costs associated with sales and marketing efforts in our solar business unit  ongoing litigation matters  increased facility related costs  sales commissions and stock based compensation costs 
selling  general and administrative expense includes approximately  of stock based compensation in versus  in internal research and development expenses the decrease in internal research and development expense in versus was primarily due to decreased development efforts within the solar equipment and biomedical services group and an allocation of certain internal research and development costs at spire semiconductor to cost of sales in in  we completed most of our three year contract with nrel to develop new solar module equipment 
the decrease in internal research and development expenses as a percentage of sales and revenues was due to the decrease in costs 
gain on sale of trademark we sold gloria solar a pv module line operated by the our solar system business along with the transfer of technology and rights to mark the modules with our trademark to build  design and sell specialty bipv and pv modules  in exchange for  in cash 
this transaction closed on september  as of december  we still had outstanding obligations to refurbish the module line and provide some additional pv module design work 
we believe the sale of the trademark and the other goods and services meets the criteria of emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple elements  paragraph a  as each element has utility on a stand alone basis 
further  question to sab topic a f was considered as guidance for determining if the trademark fee under the agreement should be recognized as a sale 
as the trademark agreement has no term and is permanent in nature  the earnings process was complete  accordingly  we recognized a gain on the sale 
we have determined the fair value of the trademark sale  the pv module line and services based on a third party appraisal 
as a result  a  gain was recognized on the sale of the trademark for the year ended december  we also recognized  in service revenue reflecting the delivery of pv technology designs to build pv modules 
we have sold and will continue to sell this technology to other customers as part of our equipment business 
as of december   the fair value of the undelivered goods and services was  which is in advance on contracts in progress 
gloria solar has further contracted with us to purchase additional pv module equipment lines at market prices 
we also provide gloria solar general and administrative services and provide space in our facility on a pass through basis 
other income expense  net we earned  and  of interest income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we incurred interest expense of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreased interest income is due to lower cash balances held by us during compared with the increase interest expense is due to higher interest payments associated with the million term loan outstanding with silicon valley bank compared with interest expenses primarily associated with interest incurred on capital leases associated with the semiconductor foundry 
we recorded a  loss on equity investment in joint venture with gloria solar for the year ended december  we recorded  currency transaction loss related to the conversion of a japanese yen account into us dollars for each of the years ended december  and income taxes we recorded a benefit for income taxes of  related to income from continuing operations for year ended december   representing the tax benefit of the continuing operation loss that is offset by the extraordinary gain 
we did not record an income tax benefit for the year ended december  a full valuation allowance has been provided against the deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding the realization of the net operating loss in the future 
a valuation allowance was provided against the deferred tax assets generated in and due to uncertainty regarding the realization of the net operating loss in the future 
at december   we had gross deferred tax assets of  against which a valuation allowance of  had been applied 
net earnings loss we reported a net losses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we recorded a gain of  from the sale of trademark and an extraordinary gain  net of taxes of  compared to no gains from trademarks and extraordinary gains in we are likely to continue to report losses unless we can increase revenues or sell additional technology licenses 
if additional sources of revenue are not identified we can take measures to reduce costs but it is unclear whether cost reductions alone can eliminate all of the potential future losses 
equity investment in joint venture on july   we entered into contractual relationship with gloria solar co  ltd 
gloria solar pursuant to which i we sold gloria solar certain assets belonging to our solar systems business for  and ii we and gloria solar formed a joint venture named gloria spire solar  llc  for the purpose of pursuing the solar photovoltaic systems market within the united states 
the joint venture will design  market  sell and manage the installation of systems for the generation of electrical power by solar photovoltaic means in primarily commercial industrial and utility segments of such market the jv systems business 
gloria solar owns of the joint venture and we own of the joint venture 
in connection with the formation of the joint venture  i we contributed to the joint venture assets primarily relating to the jv systems business  including certain intellectual property and know how  access to information technology assets and relationships  relationships with current and previous customers  contract backlog and project opportunities  certain registered trademarks  and employment relationships with staff members and ii gloria solar contributed  in cash 
this transaction closed on september  our initial investment was recorded at  we are accounting for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method  as we have significant influence over the investee  however  we lack significant control 
we will be reporting the ongoing financial results of the joint venture one quarter in arrears 
we recorded a  loss on equity investment in joint venture for the year ended december  as a result of applying the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock to the differences between the fair value of the assets contributed and the cost basis on our books  we recorded an extraordinary gain of  net of tax provision of  additional recognition of the deferential will be recorded over time to offset our ownership percentage of the amortization of the contributed intangibles assets as recorded on the joint venture s books 
if the managing board of the joint venture determines that additional capital is required to support the operations of the joint venture  the joint venture shall make a call for additional funds 
within ten days after the members have received written notice of the call  the members shall make additional capital contributions to the joint venture in proportion to each member s interest in the joint venture 
if a member fails to fund its pro rata portion of any capital call  the non defaulting member may purchase the defaulting member s shortfall  however  in no event may either member s interest in the joint venture be reduced to below 
liquidity and capital resources increase decrease december  december  cash and cash equivalents    working capital    included in working capital at december   was  of certificates of deposit with a bank  classified on the balance sheet as short term investments 
 of this short term investment was restricted as security for a letter of credit 
on april   we entered into stock purchase agreements with two accredited institutional investors in connection with the private placement of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
on april   we completed the private placement 
the net proceeds of the sale were approximately million after deducting placement fees and other closing costs 
the proceeds were used to fund additions to property plant and equipment  short term investments and operating losses 
under the terms of the stock purchase agreements  we were obligated to file a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission the sec registering the resale of the shares of common stock sold 
we filed the form s on may  and the sec declared it effective on may  in the event that this registration statement ceases to be effective and available to the investors for an aggregate period of days in any month period  we must pay liquidated damages starting on the st day in the aggregate of any suspensions in any month period  and each th day thereafter until the suspension is terminated an amount equal to of the aggregate purchase price paid by the investors 
however  we are not obligated to pay liquidation damages on shares not owned by the investors at the time of the suspension or shares that are tradable without restriction under rule we reviewed emerging issues task force eitf accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  and eitf the effect of a liquidated damages clause on a freestanding financial instrument subject to eitf issue no 
 to determine if these liquidation damages provisions require a portion of the equity raised needs to be accounted under financial accounting standards fas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we determined that the liquidated damages provisions did not require treatment under fas no 
and therefore will treat all of the funds raised under these agreements as additions to permanent equity 
we had a  loan agreement with citizens bank of massachusetts which expired on june  on may   we and our wholly owned subsidiary  spire semiconductor  llc  entered into a loan and security agreement the equipment credit facility with silicon valley bank the bank 
under the equipment credit facility  for a one year period  we and spire semiconductor could borrow up to  in the aggregate to finance certain equipment purchases including reimbursement of certain previously made purchases 
each advance made under the equipment credit facility would be due thirty six months from the date the advance is made 
advances made under the equipment credit facility would bear interest at the bank s prime rate  as determined  plus at december  and payable in thirty six consecutive monthly payments following the funding date of that advance 
at december   our outstanding borrowings from the equipment line of credit amounted to  on march   we entered into a second loan and security agreement the revolving credit facility with the bank 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  the bank agreed to provide us with a credit line up to  our obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and advances under the revolving credit facility are limited to of eligible receivables and the lesser of of the value of our eligible inventory  as defined  or  if the inventory is backed by a customer letter of credit 
interest on outstanding borrowings accrues at a rate per annum equal to the greater of prime rate plus one percent or seven percent 
in addition  we agreed to pay to the bank a collateral monitoring fee of per month in the event the we are in default of our covenants and agreed to the following additional terms i  commitment fee  ii an unused line fee in the amount of per annum of the average unused portion of the revolving line  and iii an early termination fee of of the total credit line if we terminate the revolving credit facility prior to months from the revolving credit facility s effective date 
the revolving credit facility  if not sooner terminated in accordance with its terms  expires on march  in addition our existing equipment credit facility was amended whereby the bank granted a waiver for our defaults for not meeting our december  quarter liquidity and profit covenants and for not meeting our january and february liquidity covenants 
further the covenants were amended to match the new covenants contained in the revolving credit facility 
our interest rate under the equipment credit facility was also modified from bank prime plus one half percent to the greater of bank prime plus one percent or seven percent 
under the terms of the equipment credit facility  as long as any commitment remains outstanding under the facility  we must comply with an adjusted quick ratio covenant and a minimum quarterly net income covenant 
in addition  until all amounts under the credit facilities with the bank are repaid  covenants under the credit facilities impose restrictions on our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  create or permit liens on our assets  merge  consolidate or dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business  make dividend and other restricted payments  make certain debt or equity investments  make certain acquisitions  engage in certain transactions with affiliates or change the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries 
any failure by us to comply with the covenants and obligations under the credit facilities could result in an event of default  in which case the bank may be entitled to declare all amounts owed to be due and payable immediately 
our obligations under the credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due 
we actively pursue collection of past due receivables as the circumstances warrant 
customers are contacted to determine the status of payment and senior accounting and operations management are included in these efforts as deemed necessary 
a specific reserve is established for past due accounts over days and over a specified amount  when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
we do not record an allowance for government receivables and invoices backed by letters of credit as realizeability is reasonably assured 
bad debts are written off against the allowance when identified 
there is no dollar threshold for account balance write offs 
while rare  a write off is only recorded when all efforts to collect the receivable have been exhausted and only in consultation with the appropriate business line manager 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately  compared to accumulated deficit of approximately  as of december  we have incurred significant operating losses in and loss from operations  before gain on sales of trademarks  were million and million in and  respectively 
these losses from operations have resulted in cash losses loss from operations excluding gain on sales of trademark plus or minus non cash adjustments of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
we have funded these cash losses from cash receipts of million from the sale of a solar pv module line along with the transfer of technology and rights to mark the modules with our trademark in and million from the sale of equity in as of december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million compared to unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and unrestricted short term investments of million as of december  while we believe we have inherent assets and technology that we could sell or license in the near term  there is no guarantee that we would be able to sell or license those assets on a timely basis and at appropriate values that would allow us to continue to fund our operating losses 
we have developed several plans to mitigate cash losses primarily from increased revenues and  if required  potential cost reduction efforts and outside financing 
as a result  we believe we have sufficient resources to continue as a going concern at least through december  the table below details our cash loss from operations which excludes changes in working capital during the respective periods

on may   we entered into a global consortium agreement the agreement with nisshinbo industries  inc nisshinbo for the development  manufacturing  and sales of solar photovoltaic module manufacturing equipment 
nisshinbo s prior relationship with spire was as a sub licensee of marubeni corporation with whom we had a license arrangement that was originally signed in  extended in  and terminated in may nisshinbo s role as sub licensee was to manufacture equipment for marubeni to sell to the japanese market based upon our proprietary technology 
under the terms of the agreement  nisshinbo purchased a license to manufacture and sell our module manufacturing equipment on a semi exclusive basis for an upfront fee plus additional royalties based on ongoing equipment sales over a ten year period 
in addition  we and nisshinbo agreed  but are not obligated  to pursue joint research and development  product improvement activities and sales and marketing efforts 
the companies may share market costs such as product collateral and trade show expenses 
each company may also collaborate on sales leads and have the other company manufacture and service its equipment in the field 
both companies have reciprocal rights to participate in the other company s r d efforts on a going forward basis 
nisshinbo can request us to further develop a technology but nisshinbo must a share in the costs of these development efforts equally with us and thereafter have joint ownership otherwise we will own the technology under a partial contribute or no participation by nisshinbo with us receiving a royalty from nisshinbo if it utilizes the technology 
at the end of the license all non jointly owned technology developed under the agreement will revert back to the owner  with the other party being required to purchase a new license based upon the fair market value of that technology in order to continue to utilize the technology 
on june   we received jpy  from the sale of this permanent license 
we determined that the nisshinbo agreement contains multiple elements consisting of the granting of a license to utilize our technology and the semi exclusive right to utilize the technology for a period of years 
we believe the granting of the license meets the criteria of emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple elements  paragraph a  as the license to utilize the technology has value to nisshinbo on a stand alone basis 
further  question to securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin topic a f nonrefundable up front fees  was directly considered as guidance for determining if the upfront fee under the nisshinbo agreement should be recognized upon the signing of contract or recognized over the term of the license 
it is our belief that a separate earnings process was complete as nisshinbo was purchasing access to utilize technology it already had in its possession  therefore  recognition of the gain on the sale was appropriate 
we have determined the fair value of the license and royalty based on an appraisal 
as a result  a  gain was recognized as a gain on sale of license in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  the balance of  was determined to represent an advanced royalty payment and was recorded as an advance on contracts in progress 
this amount is being credited as royalty income over the ten year license period on a straight line basis 
we maintain a japanese yen account approximately jpy  as of december  
as of december   approximately  has been reflected in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet utilizing the closing yen dollar exchange rate as of december  total currency translation loss of  for each of the years ended december  and  is reflected in other expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
outstanding letters of credit totaled  at december  the letters of credit secure performance obligations and purchase commitments  and allow holders to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit if we do not perform as contractually required 
these letters of credit expire through and are secured by cash and short term investments 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements fas 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  on february   the fasb announced it will issue a fasb staff position fsp to allow a one year deferral of adoption of fas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a nonrecurrng basis 
fas provides a common fair value hierarchy for companies to follow in determining fair value measurements in the preparation of financial statements and expands disclosure requirements relating to how such fair value measurements were developed 
fas clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions that the marketplace would use when pricing an asset or liability  rather than company specific data 
we are currently assessing the impact that fas will have on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
fas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas allows companies to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the changes in fair value are recognized in earnings and the assets and liabilities measured under this methodology are required to be displayed separately in the balance sheet 
the main intent of the statement is to mitigate the difficulty in determining the reported earnings caused by a mixed attribute model or reporting some assets are fair value and others using a different valuation attribute such as amortized cost 
the project is separated into two phases 
this first phase addressed the creation of a fair value option for financial assets and liabilities 
a second phase will address creating a fair value option for selected non financial items 
fas is effective for all financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are evaluating the impact that this issuance will have on our financial position  results of operation and cash flow 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r fas r  business combinations  which revises fas and changes multiple aspects of the accounting for business combinations 
under the guidance in fas r  the acquisition method must be used  which requires the acquirer to recognize most identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and non controlling interests in the acquiree at their full fair value on the acquisition date 
goodwill is to be recognized as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of the non controlling interest over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as a liability are to be recognized in earnings  while contingent consideration classified as equity is not to be re measured 
costs such as transaction costs are to be excluded from acquisition accounting  generally leading to recognizing expense  and  additionally  restructuring costs that do not meet certain criteria at acquisition date are to be subsequently recognized as post acquisition costs 
fas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we are evaluating the impact that this issuance will have on our financial position  results of operation and cash flow 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
fas  non controlling interest in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
fas requires that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary ie minority interest be reported in the equity section of the balance sheet instead of being reported as a liability or in the mezzanine section between debt and equity 
it also requires that the consolidated income statement include consolidated net income attributable to both the parent and non controlling interest of a consolidated subsidiary 
a disclosure must be made on the face of the consolidated income statement of the net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest 
also  regardless of whether the parent purchases additional ownership interest  sells a portion of its ownership interest in a subsidiary or the subsidiary participates in a transaction that changes the parent s ownership interest  as long as the parent retains controlling interest  the transaction is considered an equity transaction 
fas is effective for annual periods beginning after december  we are evaluating the impact that this issuance will have on our financial position  results of operation and cash flow 
impact of inflation and changing prices historically  our business has not been materially impacted by inflation 
manufacturing equipment and solar systems are generally quoted  manufactured and shipped within a cycle of approximately nine months  allowing for orderly pricing adjustments to the cost of labor and purchased parts 
we have not experienced any negative effects from the impact of inflation on long term contracts 
our service business is not expected to be seriously affected by inflation because its procurement production cycle typically ranges from two weeks to several months  and prices generally are not fixed for more than one year 
research and development contracts usually include cost escalation provisions 
foreign currency fluctuation we sell only in us dollars  generally against an irrevocable confirmed letter of credit through a major united states bank 
accordingly  we are not directly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations on our current orders 
however  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates do have an effect on our customers access to us dollars and on the pricing competition on certain pieces of equipment that we sell in selected markets 
we received japanese yen in exchange for the sale of a license to our solar technology 
in addition  purchases made and royalties received under our consortium agreement with our japanese partner will be in japanese yen 
we have committed to purchase certain pieces of equipment from european vendors  these commitments are denominated in euros 
we bear the risk of any currency fluctuations that may be associated with these commitments 
we do not believe that foreign exchange fluctuations will materially affect our operations 
related party transactions we subleased  square feet in a building leased by mykrolis corporation  who in turn leased the building from spi trust  a trust of which roger little  our chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president  is the sole trustee and principal beneficiary 
the sublease  originally for a period of ten years  was extended for a five year period expiring on november  and was further extended for a five year period expiring on november  the sublease agreement provided for minimum rental payments plus annual increases linked to the consumer price index 
effective december   we entered into a two year extension of lease agreement the lease extension directly with spi trust 
we assumed certain responsibilities of mykrolis  the tenant under the former lease  as a result of the lease extension including payment of all building and real estate related expenses associated with the ongoing operations of the property 
we have allocated a portion of these expenses to spi trust based on pre established formulas utilizing square footage and actual usage where applicable 
these allocated expenses were invoiced monthly and be paid utilizing a spi trust escrow account of which we have sole withdrawal authority 
spi trust is required to maintain three months of its anticipated operating costs within this escrow account 
on december   we and spi trust amended the lease extension to include the lease of an additional  square feet from spi trust for a one year term 
the additional space was leased at a rate of per square foot on annual basis 
the additional space was used to expand our solar operations 
on november   we entered into a new lease agreement the new lease with spi trust  with respect to  square feet of space comprising the entire building in which we have occupied space since december  the term of the new lease commenced on december  and continues for five years until november  we have the right to extend the term of the new lease for an additional five year period 
the annual rental rate for the first year of the new lease is per square foot on a triple net basis  whereby the tenant is responsible for operating expenses  taxes and maintenance of the building 
the annual rental rate increases on each anniversary by per square foot 
if we exercise our right to extend the term of the new lease  the annual rental rate for the first year of the extended term will be the greater of a the rental rate in effect immediately preceding the commencement of the extended term or b the market rate at such time  and on each anniversary of the commencement of the extended term the rental rate will increase by per square foot 
we believe that the terms of the new lease are commercially reasonable 
rent expense under the new lease and the lease extension  as amended  for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively 
in connection with the lease extension  as amended  we were invoiced and paid certain spi trust related expenses  including building maintenance and insurance 
we invoiced spi trust on a monthly basis and spi trust reimbursed us for all such costs 
approximately  was due from spi trust as of december  for building related costs and no amounts due as of december  in conjunction with our acquisition of bandwidth now known as spire semiconductor in may  spi trust purchased from stratos lightwave  inc spire semiconductor s former owner the building that spire semiconductor occupies in hudson  new hampshire for million 
subsequently  we entered into a lease for the building  square feet with spi trust whereby we agreed to pay million to the spi trust over an initial five year term expiring in with our option to extend for five years 
in addition to the rent payments  the lease obligates us to keep on deposit with spi trust the equivalent of three months rent  as of december  
the lease agreement does not provide for a transfer of ownership at any point 
interest costs were assumed at 
interest expense was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this lease has been classified as a related party capital lease and a summary of payments including interest follows rate per annual monthly security year square foot rent rent deposit june  may     june  may     june  may     june  may     june  may      at december    reflected the current portion of capital lease obligation related party  with no long term portion  in the consolidated balance sheet 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to revenue recognition  reserves for doubtful accounts and sales returns and allowances  reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  and warranty reserves 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
refer to footnote of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from three primary sources commercial products including  but not limited to  solar energy manufacturing equipment  solar energy systems and hemodialysis catheters  biomedical and semiconductor processing services  and united states government funded research and development contracts 
we generally recognize product revenue upon shipment of products provided there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor  unless a consignment arrangement exists 
revenue from consignment arrangements is recognized based on product usage indicating sales are complete 
we utilize a distributor network to market and sell its hemodialysis catheters domestically 
we generally recognize revenue when the catheters are shipped to our distributors 
gross sales reflect reductions attributable to customer returns and various customer incentive programs including pricing discounts and rebates 
product returns are permitted in certain sales contracts and an allowance is recorded for returns based on our history of actual returns
