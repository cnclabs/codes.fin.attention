item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in other places in this annual report 
such statements may be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  expect  believe  estimate  anticipate  intend  continue  or similar terms  variations of such terms or the negative of such terms 
such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based 
factors that could cause such results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements include those set forth below 
risks relating to our business we have incurred significant and continuing net losses since our inception and may continue to incur losses 
we incurred net losses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve net income on a quarterly or annual basis 
if our revenues do not increase  or if our operating expenses exceed expectations or cannot be reduced  we will continue to incur substantial losses  which would materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
if search engines alter their algorithms or methods or otherwise restrict the flow of users visiting our web properties  our business and financial results could suffer 
search engines serve as origination web properties for users in search of information  and our topic pages often appear as one of the top links on the pages returned by search engines in response to users search queries 
as a result  we rely heavily on search engines for a substantial portion of the users visiting our web properties 
according to our internal estimates traffic to our web properties originating from search engines during the fourth quarter of  excluding google directed definition link traffic  was approximately of the overall traffic to our web properties  the majority of which originated from google and  to a lesser but still significant extent  yahoo 
our wikianswers search engine traffic during the same period was even more significant  amounting to approximately of its overall traffic 
if our traffic from search engines declines for any reason  we would suffer a significant decline in overall traffic and revenue 
for example  in july  a search engine algorithm adjustment by google led to a drop in google directed traffic to answers 
com 
this adjustment reduced our overall traffic by approximately based on the average traffic directed to answers 
com from google for the week prior to the adjustment as compared to the week after 
as a result  our revenue declined proportionately 
we have not been able to reverse the impact of this adjustment  and we do not anticipate that we will recover the lost traffic and revenue 
in response to the google algorithm adjustment  we reduced our headcount and related compensation costs  reducing our base payroll expenses by approximately 
in september  yahoo dropped our content from its search index  which led to a drop in our yahoo directed traffic 
this action was reversed within a week  and we have recovered all of our yahoo directed traffic 
search engines  at any time and for any reason  could change their algorithms that direct search queries to our web properties or could restrict the flow of users visiting our web properties specifically 
in fact  as illustrated above  on occasion our web properties have experienced decreases in traffic  and consequently in revenue  due to these search engine actions 
we cannot guarantee that we will successfully react to these actions in the future and recover the lost traffic 
accordingly  a change in algorithms that search engines use to identify web pages towards which traffic will ultimately be directed  or a restriction on the flow of users visiting our web properties from the search engines  could cause a significant decrease in traffic and revenues  which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
we depend on google to direct traffic to answers 
com through its definition link  and the loss of this source of traffic could significantly reduce our ad revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results 
a significant percentage of our direct traffic is directed to answers 
com by the definition link appearing on google s website result pages 
as an additional result of this arrangement  a significant number of secondary users visit web properties via the definition link and perform additional searches 
we refer to these users as secondary traffic 
the definition link traffic is the result of a unilateral decision by google to link certain definitions to answers 
com  and not any contractual relationship 
google may change these links at any time  in its sole discretion 
according to our internal estimates  for the fourth quarter of  the primary and secondary traffic from the google definition link accounted for approximately of the traffic to our web properties 
if google stops directing traffic to answers 
com through its definition link  we would experience a significant reduction in our traffic and the corresponding ad revenues  which would adversely affect our business and financial results 
if our gsa is terminated by google  we would have to seek an alternative provider of listings and advertisements  which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
our business is dependent on the gsa  under which we obtain most of the advertisements displayed on our web properties and earn most of our ad revenues 
google may terminate the gsa with no advance notice if we take certain prohibited actions including  among other things editing or modifying the order of search results  redirecting end users  producing or distributing any software which prevents the display of ads by google  modifying  adapting or otherwise attempting to obtain source code from google technology  content  software and documentation or engaging in any action or practice that reflects poorly on google or otherwise disparaging or devaluing google s reputation or goodwill  breach the grant of a license to us by google of certain trade names  trademarks  service marks  logos  domain names and other distinctive brand features of google  breach the confidentiality provisions of the gsa  breach the exclusivity provisions of the gsa  or materially breach the gsa more than two times  irrespective of any cure to such breaches 
the gsa is scheduled to expire on january   unless renewed upon mutual written consent 
google s termination of the gsa would result in our need to replace this relationship and obtain listings and advertisements from alternative providers  and we may not succeed in receiving equally favorable terms as those provided in the gsa 
termination of the gsa and our failure to replace it on equally favorable terms could result in a material reduction in our ad revenues and could adversely affect our business and financial results 
if in the interest of improving user experience and user satisfaction  we decide to decrease the number of ad elements displayed on our web properties  our advertising revenues will decline and our financial results will be adversely impacted 
we closely monitor the ratio between ad elements and actual content appearing on our web pages 
in the future we may decide that in order to enhance the user experience and increase user satisfaction  our pages should display fewer ad elements 
displaying less ad intensive web pages is likely to result in faster page load and offering more content per page is likely to appeal more to the user 
a better user experience may result in more stickiness on our web properties and a higher rate of user relention and return visits 
however  there is no assurance that reducing advertising on our web properties will result in better user retention and return visits and there can be no guarantee that the short term reduction in ad revenues will pay off in the long term in the form of increased traffic 
a decrease in the number of ad elements displayed on our web properties will result in a short term drop in rpm and a reduction in advertising revenues which will have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
the failure of wikianswers to grow in accordance with our expectations could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 
wikianswers is currently our primary growth driver 
we estimate that in the second half of  wikianswers will exceed answers 
com in both traffic and revenue 
wikianswers is experiencing a growth phenomenon that we refer to as a network effect 
the site s growth facilitates further growth 
as a result  we are spending increasing amounts of money and devoting greater resources to the development of wikianswers 
if  for whatever reason  wikianswers fails to perform as well as we anticipate  and the growth we are experiencing falters or ceases  our business and financial results could be adversely affected 
if internet users do not interact with our wikianswers web property frequently or if we fail to attract new users to the service  our business and financial results will suffer 
the success of our wikianswers web property is largely dependent upon users constantly interacting with the community by asking questions  posting answers and improving upon both 
we have seen a very high correlation between growth in questions and answers and growth in the site s page views 
we need to attract users to register as community members  visit the web property frequently and spend increasing amounts of time on the web property when they visit 
in addition  only a very small number of users actually post information on the site on a regular basis and are engaged in improving the information it contains 
if we are unable to encourage users to interact more frequently with our wikianswers web property and to increase the amount of user generated content they provide  our ability to attract new users to the web property  increase the number of registered users loyal to the community and attract advertisers to wikianswers will be diminished and adversely affected 
as a result  our business and financial results will suffer  and we will not be able to grow our business as planned 
if we are unable to improve and maintain the quality of content being contributed to wikianswers  the web property will become less valuable to the users  less popular as a destination for obtaining answers to questions and its growth will be negatively affected  which in turn could adversely impact our financial results 
it is critical that we ensure that the quality of content being posted on wikianswers  both questions and answers  is maintained and improved over time 
the better the quality of the content generated on the web property  the more valuable the web property will be for users in search of answers  which in turn will lead to stronger growth in the community size 
we will need to closely monitor the content being contributed by users and constantly be on the alert for and filter out content that does not add value  or even worse  damages the user experience 
if we fail to maintain and improve the quality of the web property s content  the appeal of wikianswers to users may diminish and the growth of the web property may be negatively affected  which in turn could cause our financial results to suffer 
if we are unable to attract and retain dedicated supervisors for wikianswers for the administration of the web property and the encouragement of the community s expansion  our plans for growing wikianswers may fail and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
much of the effort of administering wikianswers  monitoring its activity and ensuring its steady growth and development is borne by a large group of external supervisors  the vast majority of whom are not employed by us and not compensated for their efforts 
the supervisors are in charge of monitoring questions and answers in specific categories in an effort to ensure questions are being answered timely  prevent vandalism  improve consistency and encourage high quality contributions 
as of december   the community enjoyed the benefit of approximately such supervisors 
the success of wikianswers is dependant  to a certain extent  on the continued attention of these supervisors to wikianswers 
if we are not able to attract and maintain enough supervisors  the wikianswers web property will suffer and the web property will become less attractive to users  which in turn will adversely affect the site s growth and our business and financial results 
our direct ad sales efforts may suffer if advertisers do not find our web properties to be effective for promoting their products and services  which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 
in late  our advertising sales team began marketing directly to advertisers 
however  we cannot assure you that these advertisers will find our web properties to be as effective as other web properties or traditional media for promoting their products and services 
in fact  while our direct advertising efforts have the potential to be a driver of future monetization improvements  the results of our direct ad sales team have not reached desired levels 
failure on our part to convince advertisers of the suitability of our web properties for their needs  or our inability to generate the advertisers desired levels of traffic  could make it difficult to attract new advertisers and may cause us to lose relationships with existing advertisers  which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 
components of our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth 
if we fail to effectively manage our growth  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we have experienced rapid growth in our headcount and operations over the past several years  which has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on our management  operational and financial infrastructure 
if we do not effectively manage our growth  the quality of our products and services could suffer  which could negatively affect our brand and operating results 
to effectively manage this growth  we will need to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures 
these systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and management resources 
failure to implement these improvements could hurt our ability to manage our growth and our financial position 
we have a short operating history and a relatively new business model in an emerging and rapidly evolving market 
this makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risks that we will not continue to be successful and that our financial results could suffer 
there are two primary categories of internet advertising  pay per performance  or most commonly cost per click  or cpc  and pay per impression  or cost per  impressions  or cpm 
in the case of performance based advertising  the advertiser only pays when a user clicks on an ad  as opposed to viewing the ad  as in impression based advertising 
we first derived advertising revenue in the first quarter of  and we have only a short operating history with our cpc and cpm advertising model 
as a result  we have very little operating history to aid in assessing our future prospects 
also  we derive nearly all of our revenues from online advertising  which is an immature industry that has undergone rapid and dramatic changes in its short history 
we will encounter risks and difficulties as a growing company in a new and rapidly evolving market 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties  which could materially harm our business and operating results 
we may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms  if at all  or without dilution to our stockholders 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our current needs for general corporate purposes for at least the next months 
however  we may need or desire additional financing to execute on our current or future business strategies  including to improve traffic monetization and expand content on our web properties  enhance our operating infrastructure  acquire businesses or technologies  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted  and these newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  when we desire them  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance our services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
we generate our revenue almost entirely from advertising so uncertainties in the internet advertising market and our failure to increase advertising inventory on our web properties could adversely affect our ad revenues 
although worldwide online advertising spending is growing steadily  it represents only a small percentage of total advertising expenditures 
our advertisers can generally terminate their contracts with us at any time 
advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in internet advertising with us does not generate sales leads  and ultimately customers  or if we do not deliver their advertisements in an appropriate and effective manner 
if the internet does not continue to be as widely accepted as a medium for advertising and the rate of advertising on the internet increase  our ability to generate increased revenues could be adversely affected 
we believe that growth in our ad revenues will also depend on our ability to increase the number of pages on our web properties to provide more advertising inventory 
if we fail to increase our advertising inventory at a sufficient rate  our ad revenues could grow more slowly than we expect  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
new technologies could block internet ads  which could harm our financial results 
technologies have been developed  and are likely to continue to be developed  that can block the display of internet ads 
most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of their ads 
ad blocking technology may cause a decrease in the number of ads that we can display on our web properties  which could adversely affect our ad revenues and our financial results 
we face significant competition from search engines  destination portals and other free reference and industry specific web properties that could adversely impact our competitive position 
we face significant competition from a wide variety of web properties  including traditional search engines  such as google  yahoo and ask 
com  destination portals and other free online answer engines  such as about 
com  thefreedictionary 
com and wikipedia 
org 
we also compete with industry specific web properties  such as bankrate 
com and webmd 
com  as well as with other popular question and answer sites  such as yahoo answers  askville owned by amazon  yedda owned by aol and answerbag 
com owned by demand media  inc 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  more extensive management experience  an employee base with more extensive experience  better geographic coverage  larger consumer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resource than we do 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
if our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or attracting and retaining users or advertisers  then our competitive position and financial results could be adversely affected 
our failure to generate direct traffic to our web properties could adversely affect our business and financial results 
in addition to search engine traffic and traffic directed by the google definition link  our traffic also originates from internet users arriving at our web properties directly by typing our website address directly into their web browser  bookmarking our web properties  using answertips and visiting sites that direct users to our web properties 
given the wide availability of free search engines and reference content sites  we may not be able to retain current internet users or attract new internet users in this direct fashion 
if we are unable to retain our direct internet users or attract new direct internet users  our ability to generate revenues would be adversely impacted  which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
traffic to our web properties and advertising demand fluctuates significantly on a seasonal basis  which impacts our operations from quarter to quarter 
many of our users are students that utilize our web properties as reference sources 
our traffic fluctuates with the academic school year  rising from february through may  falling to its lowest levels during the summer months  rising again in september and falling again in december through january 
we expect traffic to our web properties to continue to fluctuate seasonally in the future 
this seasonal fluctuation in traffic results in a fluctuation in our quarterly revenues  since fewer users to our web properties translates into fewer users viewing or clicking on the advertisements on our web properties 
in addition  the demand for our advertising inventory fluctuates during the year based on the seasonal needs of our advertisers  rising to its highest levels during the fourth quarter and falling to its lowest levels in the first quarter 
accordingly  our revenue fluctuates based on the seasonality of our traffic and advertising demand 
the effect of this seasonality makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific quarter 
as a result  we may be unable to forecast our revenue accurately  and a failure to meet our revenue or expense forecasts could have an immediate and negative impact on the market price of our common stock 
our operating results may fluctuate  which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations 
our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  many outside of our control 
as a result  comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful  and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance 
our quarterly  year to date and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates 
our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations 
any of these events could cause our stock price to fall 
our partnerships and revenue sharing arrangements with third parties may not be renewed or continued  which could impact our credibility in the marketplace  which could adversely affect our traffic and revenues 
we have entered into revenue sharing and other arrangements with third parties that direct traffic to our web properties and license our online answer engine services  and we plan to enter into similar arrangements in the future 
although these arrangements have not had a substantial impact on our revenues to date  they have provided us with third party validation of our product offerings 
we believe these arrangements and similar arrangements may result in significant revenues in the future 
these arrangements may be terminated or discontinued by the third parties upon varying notice periods 
if these arrangements and similar arrangements impact our revenues substantially in the future  then termination of any of these arrangements would result in the loss of ad revenue and adversely affect our financial condition 
further  termination of any of these arrangements could impact our credibility in the marketplace  which could adversely affect our traffic and revenues 
we may not be successful in expanding our business through acquisitions  business combinations and other transactions  and  even if we are successful  our operations may be adversely affected as a result of these transactions 
we intend to pursue acquisitions  business combinations and joint ventures  which we refer to as extraordinary transactions 
our ability to implement this business strategy depends in large part on our ability to compete successfully with other entities for acquisition candidates and joint venture partners 
factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include our financial condition and resources relative to the financial condition and resources of competitors  our ability to issue common stock as potential consideration  the attractiveness of our common stock as potential consideration relative to the common stock of competitors  our ability to obtain financing  and our available cash  which depends upon our results of operations and our cash demands 
in addition  we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms  if at all 
if we do complete acquisitions  we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals  or such acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers  financial markets or investors 
in addition  any acquisitions that we make could lead to difficulties in integrating personnel and operations from the acquired businesses and in retaining and motivating key personnel from these businesses 
acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations  divert management from day to day responsibilities  increase our expenses or adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  we experienced such disruption  diversion and increased expenses during the course of our recent failed attempt to acquire lexico publishing group  llc 
future acquisitions may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses and could result in an increase in amortization expense related to identifiable assets acquired  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
if we fail to maintain and enhance awareness of our web properties  our business and financial results could be adversely affected 
we believe that maintaining and enhancing awareness of our web properties is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services and to the success of our business 
we also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry in our market 
maintaining and enhancing our web properties may require us to spend increasing amounts of money on  and devote greater resources to  advertising  marketing and other brand building efforts  and these investments may not be successful 
further  even if these efforts are successful  they may not be cost effective 
if we are unable to continuously maintain and enhance our web properties  our traffic may decrease and we may fail to attract advertisers  which could in turn result in lost revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results 
our failure to offer compelling content and provide our users with quality information could result in lost revenue  as a result of a loss of users and advertisers 
we believe our future success depends in part upon our ability to deliver valuable content through our web properties 
we are heavily dependent on licensed content 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to enter into new or renew current or future content agreements on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to maintain and enhance our existing relationships with content providers or develop new relationships with alternative providers of content  our answers 
com service may become less attractive to internet users  resulting in decreased traffic to answers 
com  which could have an adverse effect on our ad revenues and a negative impact on our business 
if we are unable to maintain and expand our computer and communications systems  then interruptions and failures in our services could result  making our services less attractive to consumers and subjecting us to lost revenue from the loss of users and advertisers 
our ability to provide high quality user experience depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
over time  our web properties have experienced significant increases in traffic  and we continuously seek to further increase our user base 
accordingly  our internet servers must accommodate spikes in demand for our web pages in addition to potential significant growth in traffic 
delays and interruptions could frustrate users and reduce traffic on our web properties  adversely affecting our operations and growth prospects 
we currently outsource our web hosting services to data return llc  recently acquired by terremark worldwide  inc we believe the economic justification of outsourcing our web hosting services has diminished  thus  we are in the process of migrating our web properties to co location facilities and managing the operations with our own staff 
this change may be technologically challenging to implement  take time to test and deploy  cause us to incur substantial costs or data loss  and cause users  advertisers  and affiliates to experience delays or interruptions in our service 
these changes  delays or interruptions in our service could cause users and advertisers to become dissatisfied with our service and move to competing providers of online services  reducing the traffic on our web properties and adversely affecting our business and financial results 
if we were to lose the services of our key personnel  we may not be able to execute our business plan and our business could be adversely affected 
our ability to execute our business plan depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key technology  marketing  sales and support personnel 
our employment agreements with our executive officers and key employees are terminable by either party upon days notice 
if we lose the services of one or more of our key employees  or if one or more of our executive officers or key employees joined a competitor or otherwise competed with us  our business could be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain or replace our key personnel  and the services of key members of our research and development team  in particular  would be difficult to replace 
if we do not succeed in retaining or replacing our key personnel  we may be unable to execute our business plan and  as a result  our stock price may decline 
our business depends on increasing use of the internet by users searching for information  advertisers marketing products and services and web properties seeking to earn revenue to support their web content 
if the internet infrastructure does not grow and is not maintained to support these activities  our business will be harmed 
our success will depend on the continued growth and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security for providing reliable internet services 
internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it if the number of internet users continues to increase  or if existing or future internet users access the internet more often or increase their bandwidth requirements 
in addition  viruses  worms and similar programs may harm the performance of the internet 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as our ability to provide our solutions 
rules established by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  require us to expense equity compensation given to our employees and may impact our ability to effectively utilize equity compensation to attract and retain employees 
the fasb has adopted changes that require companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives effective january   which we have adopted 
these accounting changes may cause us to reduce the availability and amount of equity incentives provided to employees  which may make it more difficult for us to attract  retain and motivate key personnel 
additionally  it may be difficult for us to estimate the impact of such compensation charges on future operating results because they will be based upon the fair market value of our common stock and other assumptions at future dates 
we may be subject to liability for online services  which may not be limited by the safe harbors in the digital millennium copyright act  or dmca  the communications decency act  or cda  or the us children s online privacy protection act  or coppa 
if we do not meet the safe harbor requirements  or if it is otherwise determined that our web properties contain actionable content  we could be subject to claims  which could be costly and time consuming to defend 
we host certain services that enable individuals to generate content and engage in various online activities 
the law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the united states and internationally 
claims have been threatened and may in the future be brought against us for defamation  invasion of privacy  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  unlawful activity  tort  including personal injury  fraud  or other theories based on the nature and content of information to which we provide links  or that may be posted online or generated by the users of our web properties 
our defense of any of these actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources 
the dmca is intended  among other things  to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third party web properties that include materials that infringe copyrights or rights of others 
additionally  portions of the cda are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third party content 
a safe harbor for copyright infringement is also available under the dmca to certain online service providers that provide specific services  if the providers take certain affirmative steps as set forth in the dmca 
important questions regarding the safe harbor under the dmca and the cda have yet to be litigated  and we can not guarantee that we will meet the safe harbor requirements of the dmca or of the cda 
if we are not covered by a safe harbor  for any reason  we could be exposed to claims  which could be costly and time consuming to defend 
in addition  coppa was enacted in october coppa imposes civil and criminal penalties on persons distributing material harmful to minors over the internet to persons under the age of or collecting personal information from children under the age of we do not knowingly collect and disclose personal information from minors 
the manner in which coppa may be interpreted and enforced cannot yet be determined 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright  defamation  obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain 
we may be subject to claims that our content violates such laws  which could damage our business and cause our stock price to decline 
we also periodically enter into arrangements to offer third party products  services or content under the answers brand or through our web properties 
we may be subject to claims concerning these products  services or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing  branding  broadcasting or providing access to them  even if we do not ourselves host  operate  provide  or provide access to them 
it is also possible that  if any information provided directly by us contains errors or is otherwise negligently provided to users  third parties could make claims against us 
while it is our belief that the terms of use governing the use of our web properties covers us against these types of claims  there are no assurances as to the final determination of these types of claims by any court of law 
furthermore  investigating and defending any of these types of claims is expensive  even to the extent that the claims are without merit or do not ultimately result in liability 
third parties may claim that we are infringing on their patents  trademarks or copyrights  which could result in substantial costs  diversion of significant managerial resources and significant harm to our reputation 
the industry in which we operate is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
we expect that internet technologies  software products and services may be increasingly subject to third party patent infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
from time to time  third parties may assert patent infringement claims against us in various jurisdictions that are important to our business 
additionally  third parties may assert trademark infringement claims with respect to brand names we use from time to time and content we display on our web properties 
for example  a third party may make claims against us over the display of search results triggered by search terms that include trademark terms 
furthermore  we may be faced with copyright infringement claims 
we have received  and are likely to continue to receive  cease and desist letters demanding that we remove infringing content from our web properties based on a theory of copyright and trademark infringement 
a successful patent  trademark or copyright infringement claim against us by any third party  could subject us to substantial liability for damages and litigation costs  including attorneys fees  lawsuits that prevent us from further use of intellectual property and require us to permanently cease and desist from selling or marketing products that use the intellectual property  licensing intellectual property from a third party  which could include significant licensing and royalty fees not presently paid by us  adding materially to the our costs of operations  developing new intellectual property  as a non infringing alternative  that could delay projects  add materially to our costs of operations and be unacceptable to our users  which in turn could adversely affect our traffic and revenues  and indemnifying third parties who have entered into agreements with us with respect to losses they incurred as a result of the infringement  which could include consequential and incidental damages that are material in amount 
regardless of the merit of third party infringement claims  these claims could result in substantial costs  diversion of significant resources and management attention  termination of customer contracts  loss of customers and significant harm to our reputation 
finally  many of our agreements with advertisers  distribution partners  and other third party partners require us to indemnify these partners for certain third party intellectual property infringement claims  which could increase our costs as a result of defending the claims and may require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling in any of the claims 
an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our products and services to others and may require that we procure substitute products or services  which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our reputation  adversely affecting our competitive position and financial results 
our ability to compete depends in part upon the strength of our proprietary rights in our technologies  brands and content 
we rely on a combination of us and foreign patents  copyrights  trademark  trade secret laws and license agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective at stopping unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
in addition  effective trademark  patent  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available or cost effective in every country in which our services are made available through the internet 
there may be instances where we are not able to fully protect or utilize our intellectual property in a manner that maximizes competitive advantage 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights from unauthorized use  the value of our web properties may be reduced  which could negatively impact our business 
in addition  protecting our intellectual property and other proprietary rights is expensive and diverts critical managerial resources 
if any of the foregoing were to occur  or if we are otherwise unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights  our business and financial results could be adversely affected 
new government regulation and legal uncertainties could require us to incur significant expenses 
the laws and regulations applicable to the internet  and to our products and services  are evolving and unclear and could damage our business 
in addition  we will be subject to any new laws and regulations directly applicable to our products and services 
it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted covering issues such as user privacy  pricing  taxation  content regulation  quality of products and services  and intellectual property ownership and infringement 
this legislation could expose us to substantial liability as well as dampen the growth in use of the internet generally  decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications and commercial medium  or require us to incur significant compliance expenses 
compliance with these laws and regulations may also cause us to change or limit our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 
increased regulation or the imposition of access fees could substantially increase the costs of communicating on the internet  potentially decreasing the demand for our products 
a number of proposals have been made at the federal  state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the internet 
such proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of electronic commerce and could adversely affect us 
due to the global nature of the internet  it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate its transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws 
we might unintentionally violate these laws 
such laws may be modified  or new laws may be enacted  in the future 
our business may be negatively affected by a variety of new or existing laws and regulations  which may expose us to substantial compliance costs and liabilities and may impede the growth in use of the internet generally 
risks related to our common stock we have a limited number of common shares available for future issuance which could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or consummate acquisitions 
we are authorized to issue  shares of common stock 
we currently have outstanding  shares of common stock or approximately  shares of common stock after giving effect to the exercise of all outstanding warrants and options 
due to the limited number of authorized shares available for issuance and because of the significant competition for acquisitions  we may not able to consummate an acquisition until we increase the number of shares we are authorized to issue 
to facilitate the possibility and flexibility of raising of additional capital or the completion of potential acquisitions  we will seek shareholder approval to increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock 
we can provide no assurance that we will succeed in amending our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue 
our common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and may fluctuate significantly 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global market 
although an active trading market has developed for our common stock  there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will be sustained 
failure to maintain an active trading market for our common stock may adversely affect our shareholders ability to sell our common stock in short time periods  or at all 
our common stock has experienced  and may experience in the future  significant price and volume fluctuations  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
there may be substantial sales of our common stock  which could cause our stock price to fall 
all of our issued and outstanding shares are immediately available for sale in the public market without registration under rule sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause the price of our securities to fall and could impair our ability to raise capital by selling additional securities 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we could issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting then current stockholder interests 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without stockholder approval  to issue a series of preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights  which could dilute the interest of  or impair the voting power of  our stockholders 
the issuance of a series of preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control 
although we do not presently intend to issue any shares of preferred stock  we may do so in the future 
provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes  with one class being elected each year by our stockholders  which generally makes it more difficult for stockholders to replace a majority of directors and obtain control of our board 
in addition  stockholder meetings may be called only by our board of directors  the chairman of the board and the president  advance notice is required prior to stockholder proposals and stockholders may not act by written consent 
furthermore  we have authorized preferred stock that is undesignated  making it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of our company 
delaware law also could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
specifically  section of the delaware general corporation law  to which our company is subject  may have an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors  including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by our stockholders 
we are at risk of securities class action litigation 
securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially relevant for us because internet companies often experience significant stock price volatility 
if we faced such litigation  it could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 
we have determined that we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm our business and trading price of our stock 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations of the sec require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm attesting to and reporting on these controls 
we have dedicated significant amounts of time and resources to ensure compliance with this legislation for the year ended december  and will continue to do so for future fiscal periods 
based on their evaluation  our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that  as of december   our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in our internal controls over i access to  and changes in  our information technology financial applications and underlying financial data  and ii the authority of our officers to obligate the company 
because of these material weaknesses  our management concluded that  as of december   we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
additionally  somekh chaikin  a member of kpmg international  issued an adverse opinion with respect to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of december  as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm our business and trading price of our stock 
further  if we do not successfully remediate the material weaknesses identified as of december   or should we determine in future fiscal periods that we have additional material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  investor confidence may be further eroded  which may also adversely affect our stock price 
material weaknesses in our internal controls may impede our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements  which could cause us to fail to file our periodic reports timely  result in inaccurate financial reporting or restatements of our financial statements  subject our stock to delisting and materially harm our business reputation and stock price 
as a public company  we are required to file annual and quarterly periodic reports containing our financial statements with the securities and exchange commission within prescribed time periods 
as part of the nasdaq global market listing requirements  we are also required to provide our periodic reports  or make them available  to our shareholders within prescribed time periods 
if we are required to restate our financial statements in the future  any specific adjustment may be adverse and may cause our operating results and financial condition  as restated  on an overall basis to be materially and adversely impacted 
as a result  we or members of our management could be the subject of adverse publicity  investigations and sanctions by such regulatory authorities as the securities and exchange commission and subject to shareholder lawsuits 
any of the above consequences could cause our stock price to decline materially and could impose significant unanticipated costs on us 
if we are not able to issue our financial statements in a timely manner  we will not be able to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the securities and exchange commission and the listing requirements of the nasdaq global market 
if these events occur  our common stock listing on the nasdaq global market could be suspended or terminated and our stock price could materially suffer 
in addition  we or members of our management could be subject to investigation and sanction by the securities and exchange commission and other regulatory authorities and to shareholder lawsuits  which could impose significant additional costs on us  divert management attention and materially harm our operating results  financial condition  business reputation and stock price 
risks related to our location in israel conditions in israel may limit our ability to produce and sell our product  which would lead to a decrease in revenues 
because most of our operations are conducted in israel  our operations are directly affected by economic  political and military conditions affecting israel 
specifically  we could be adversely affected by any major hostilities involving israel  a full or partial mobilization of the reserve forces of the israeli army  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners  risks associated with the fact that a certain number of our key employees and one officer reside in what are commonly referred to as occupied territories  risks associated with outages and disruptions of communications networks due to any hostilities involving israel  and a significant downturn in the economic or financial conditions in israel 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
despite negotiations to effect peace between israel and its arab neighbors  the future of these peace efforts is uncertain 
since october  there has been a significant increase in violence  civil unrest and hostility  including armed clashes between the state of israel and the palestinians  and acts of terror have been committed inside israel and against israeli targets in the west bank and gaza strip 
in addition  the recent armed conflict with hezbollah on the northern border of israel negatively affected business conditions in israel 
there is no indication as to how long the current hostilities will last or whether there will be any further escalation 
any further escalation in these hostilities or any future conflict  political instability or violence in the region may have a negative effect on our business  harm our results of operations and adversely affect our share price 
furthermore  there are a number of countries that restrict business with israel or with israeli companies  which may limit our ability to promote our products and services those countries 
we may not be able to enforce covenants not to compete under current israeli law that might result in added competition for our products 
we have non competition agreements with all of our employees  almost all of which are governed by israeli law 
these agreements prohibit our employees from competing with or working for our competitors  generally during and for up to months after termination of their employment 
however  israeli courts are reluctant to enforce non compete undertakings of former employees and tend  if at all  to enforce those provisions for relatively brief periods of time in restricted geographical areas and only when the employee has obtained unique value to the employer specific to that employer s business and not just regarding the professional development of the employee 
if we are not able to enforce non compete covenants  we may be faced with added competition 
the israeli government tax benefits program in which we currently participate and from which we receive benefits requires us to meet several conditions 
these programs or benefits may be terminated or reduced in the future  which may result in an increase in our tax liability 
our israeli subsidiary receives tax benefits authorized under israeli law for capital investments that are designated as approved enterprises 
to be eligible for these tax benefits  we must meet certain conditions 
if we fail to meet such conditions  these tax benefits could be cancelled  and we could be required to pay increased taxes or refund the amount of tax benefits we received  together with interest and penalties 
israeli governmental authorities have indicated that the government may in the future reduce or eliminate the benefits of such programs 
the termination or reduction of these programs and tax benefits could increase our israeli tax rates  and thereby reduce our net profits or increase our net losses 
us and israeli tax authorities may interpret tax issues in manners other than those which we have adopted  which may expose us to tax liabilities 
we operate in the us and in israel and our earnings are subject to taxation in both jurisdictions  at different rates 
relevant tax authorities may disagree with our interpretation and application in practice of tax laws and may dispute various assumptions we make during our tax planning process 
further  the tax authorities in the us and or israel may take exception with the transfer price of transactions between answers corporation and its wholly owned israeli subsidiary 
if there is a successful tax challenge of our tax position  our interpretation and or application of tax laws in practice  we may be forced to recognize additional tax liabilities  which may include interest and penalties 
this may harm our results of operations and adversely affect our financial condition 
our unrecognized tax benefits disclosed in the notes to our financial statements for the period ending december   include amounts relating to this risk factor 
our business may be impacted by nis exchange rate fluctuations  which may negatively affect our earnings 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the nis may negatively affect our earnings 
our revenues and most of our expenses are denominated in us dollars 
however  a significant portion of the expenses associated with our israeli operations  including personnel and facilities related expenses  are incurred in nis 
consequently  a devaluation of the us dollar in comparison to the nis will have the effect of increasing the dollar cost of our operations in israel 
in   and the first three months of  the us dollar depreciated against the nis by   and  respectively 
we cannot predict any future trends in the rate of devaluation or appreciation of the nis against the us dollar or of the us dollar against the nis 
despite the fact that we often use various hedging tools  including forward contracts and options  to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on our income  if the us dollar cost of our operations in israel increases  our dollar measured consolidated results of operations will be adversely affected

as a result of this settlement agreement  we paid tover  including tover s legal fees  and on july   the claim was dismissed without prejudice 
from time to time  we receive various legal claims incidental to our normal business activities  such as intellectual property infringement claims and claims of defamation and invasion of privacy 
although the results of claims cannot be predicted with certainty  we believe the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

overview we are a leading online answer engine 
our web properties currently consist of answers 
com and wikianswers 
com 
we offer information related to over million topics based on content from brand name publishers  our wikianswers community and our proprietary natural language search technology  which we refer to as answers from the web 
answers 
com combines and presents targeted information from disparate sources and delivers answers to users questions in a single consolidated view 
wikianswers 
com is a user generated content  or ugc  community based question and answer site 
according to comscore  a global internet information provider  our web properties had approximately million unique visitors in february  which ranks answers corporation number in the top us web properties 
our goal is to become the premier online provider of and leading destination for answers on any topic 
prior to january  we sold subscriptions to our reference based product  gurunet 
after the launch of answers 
com in january  we ceased offering new subscriptions to gurunet 
in february  we terminated the gurunet service 
termination of lexico acquisition on july   we entered into a purchase agreement that we subsequently amended on july  and november   and on january  we entered into an amended and restated purchase agreement  which we subsequently amended on february   to acquire all of the outstanding limited liability interests of lexico publishing group  llc for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash  subject to adjustments for closing net working capital 
consummation of the acquisition of lexico was subject to our ability to secure financing for the acquisition 
on july   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission which was declared effective on august  the registration statement covers up to an aggregate of  of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  debt securities  units or any combination thereof 
on january   we filed a prospectus supplement for a proposed public offering which we later amended on february  on february  we canceled our proposed public offering due to unfavorable market conditions 
on march   the members of lexico terminated the purchase agreement  due to our inability to finance the acquisition 
as a result of the termination of the purchase agreement and in accordance therewith  we reimbursed  of the sellers out of pocket transaction related legal and accounting expenses 
additionally  in connection with the lexico transaction  on january   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor  or the senior notes investor  for the optional purchase and sale of million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured convertible notes due  or the senior secured convertible notes 
our intent was to close the senior secured convertible notes financing in conjunction with our follow on offering  if we needed such funds to close the lexico acquisition 
since our purchase agreement with lexico was terminated  the securities purchase agreement has also terminated and pursuant to the securities purchase agreement we have paid the senior notes investor a termination fee of thousand 
the payments to lexico and the senior notes investor  aggregating  will be charged to operations in the first quarter of additionally  in connection with the proposed acquisition of lexico and follow on offering  we incurred approximately  of costs  which are reflected as deferred costs on our december  balance sheet  for various matters including legal  accounting  banking  consulting and travel 
further  we incurred an additional  of such costs in the first quarter of those additional costs and the aforesaid payments to lexico and the senior notes investor  which  in aggregate  amount to  will be charged to operations in the first quarter of acquisitions wikianswers on november   we acquired wikianswers and certain other assets for an aggregate of million in cash 
in connection with the allocation of the purchase price  we recorded goodwill of approximately thousand and intangible assets  with estimated useful lives of three to ten years  of approximately  thousand 
since the date of the acquisition the revenues and operating expenses of wikianswers have been included in our results of operations 
brainboost on december   we acquired brainboost  developer of the brainboost answer engine which we have integrated into our answers from the web technology  an artificial intelligence technology enabling natural language search on the web 
as consideration for the acquisition  we paid million in cash and issued  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately million at the time of the acquisition 
in connection with the allocation of the purchase price  we recorded an intangible asset related to the brainboost technology  of approximately million  with an estimated useful life of six years  and recognized compensation expense of approximately million 
under the terms of the acquisition  and of the shares of common stock were held in escrow for and months after the purchase date  respectively 
release from escrow was contingent upon our continued employment of one of the principals of the general partnership that formerly owned brainboost 
the escrowed shares were deemed to be compensation for services to be performed by the principal of the seller over the six month period ending may  because the escrow criteria were met  the shares were released from escrow  as scheduled  on march  and june  as a result  we recorded a compensation expense charge of approximately million  which represented the value of these shares  on a straight line basis  over the requisite six month employment commitment period 
the stock component of the consideration was subject to a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we agreed that if our registration statement was not effective with the sec by april   we would pay the sellers a penalty of  per month  pro rated daily 
our registration statement was declared effective on june   consequently  we paid the sellers thousand in the second quarter of in june  we completed our initial beta integration of the brainboost technology into answers 
com as answers from the web 
the company plans to evaluate further developing this technology through enhancements to its accuracy  range and speed 
revenue traffic our revenue is primarily driven by the traffic generated by our web properties and our ability to effectively monetize that traffic 
our current sources of traffic include the following search engines users submit queries and algorithm search engines respond by generating a list of web pages that are likely to offer the most relevant content 
when our pages rank high in the algorithmic systems of search engines  our results are more likely to be accessed by users 
for the fourth quarter of  according to our internal estimates  this source of traffic represented approximately of our traffic 
google s definition link we have an informal  non contractual relationship with google under which google links search results related to certain definitional queries to answers 
com 
for the fourth quarter of  according to our internal estimates  this source of traffic represented approximately of our traffic 
direct users users visiting and returning to our home pages  and to a far lesser extent  arriving from web properties that send us traffic  or via click answers and answertips 
for the fourth quarter of  according to our internal estimates  direct users represented approximately of our traffic 
since most of our traffic originates from search engines  we expend considerable resources improving the volume and optimizing the monetization of this traffic 
the industry commonly refers to such efforts as search engine optimization  or seo 
our web properties have at times experienced decreases in traffic  and consequently decreases in revenue  due to these search engine actions  including recent actions by google and yahoo that are discussed in the revenue discussion below 
we continuously seek to improve the user experience of visitors to our web properties  which we believe leads to increased pages per visit  or stickiness  and return visits  or user retention 
we seek to increase stickiness and user retention by adding new features  enhancing user interfaces and adding new content to our web properties 
monetization advertising revenue 
we earn most of our revenue from advertising 
there are two primary categories of internet advertising  pay per performance  or most commonly cost per click  or cpc  and pay per impression  or cost per  impressions  or cpm 
in the pay for performance model we earn revenue based on the number of clicks associated with an ad  in the paid for impression model we derive revenue from the display of ads 
we work with third party ad networks that we believe optimize the average amount of revenue we earn per page view 
third party ad networks generally compensate us by paying us a portion of the revenue they earn from advertisers for our provision of promotional space on our web properties 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we began marketing directly to advertisers and generating direct advertising revenue 
while our direct advertising efforts has the potential to be a driver of future monetization improvements  the results of our direct ad sales team have not reached desired levels 
we gauge the effectiveness of our monetization efforts and trends by measuring our rpm 
in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations prior to our quarterly report on form q for the quarterly period ended june   we reported rpm based on website queries  or traffic  directly to one of our answers 
com topic pages 
beginning with the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in our quarterly report on form q for the quarterly period ended june   we refer to rpm based on page views 
page views include traffic directly to the answers 
com home page  but exclude lookups conducted through click answers  answertips and traffic from partners who pay us for providing them our answer based services 
page views are the more widely recognized industry standard traffic metric 
based upon our internal analysis  we estimate the number of answers 
com page views to be approximately higher than the number of our previously reported answers 
com queries 
this difference is primarily attributable to home page visits in the page view traffic estimates 
historical rpm in this annual report  have been modified to conform to the new methodology and are approximately lower than amounts reported prior to our quarterly report on form q for the quarterly period ended june  our answers 
com rpm increased significantly since we launched the web property  due to the implementation of various optimization methods  including modifying the user interface  modifying the color  background and placement of ads displayed  modifying the size of ads  changing the number of ads per page  adding or switching third party ad networks  increasing the revenue share percentage offered by third party ad networks  modifying the types of ads introduced  modifying the content displayed  and introducing direct advertising sales 
we continue to monitor and adjust these  and potentially other  optimization techniques to maximize our rpm 
while we plan to continue focusing on optimizing our monetization  utilizing and expanding on many of the techniques we have used in the past  we believe that the primary factor that will improve our web properties rpm  if any  is selling ads directly through our own sales force 
excluding expected growth in direct ad sales revenue  we anticipate that our rpm will fluctuate around current levels 
in the second half of  we hired our vice president of advertising sales 
during the second quarter of  we hired three additional salespersons 
while our direct advertising efforts has the potential to be a driver of future monetization improvements  the results of our direct ad sales team have not reached desired levels 
two of our third party ad networks  google and shopping 
com  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue in and approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue in in addition to google and shopping 
com  we utilize the services of other third party ad networks that provide us with ads 
although there are many companies that provide third party ad networks  the loss of google as a third party ad network could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  as we may not succeed in receiving terms and ad services as favorable as those provided under our gsa with google 
while the drop in traffic due to the july google search engine algorithm adjustment impacted our aggregate advertising revenue  it did not affect our contractual relationship with google under the gsa 
licensing revenue 
we also earn revenues from partners that pay us for providing them with our answer based services that they then use in their own products  via co branded web pages 
revenue from these arrangements are based on various formulas  including a percentage of the revenues these parties earn by delivering our services to their users  fees based on the number of user queries and fixed periodic fees 
subscription revenue 
prior to december  we sold lifetime subscriptions to gurunet  generally for per subscription 
in december  we decided to alter our pricing model and moved to an annual subscription model  for which we generally charged our subscribers per year 
we have not sold subscriptions since our launch of answers 
com in january as of february  we terminated the gurunet service 
subscription revenue in periods subsequent to january reflects the recognition of revenue from subscriptions that we sold prior to our launch of answers 
com in january costs and expenses cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of fees to third party providers of content  web search service fees  ad serving fees  amortization of the cost of acquired software used in our products  data center costs including depreciation of information technology assets  contractual revenue sharing fees to various web property operators for visitors directed to our web properties  or traffic acquisition costs  as well as the compensation  travel and overhead costs relating to personnel who are responsible for content editing and integration  production operations and customer support 
as revenue increases  we expect our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to decrease  however  we may experience an increase in our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue  during the transition period  in the first half of  related to our anticipated shift to a co location facility for hosting our web properties  rather than our current managed hosting facility  since we will need to operate both facilities during the transition period 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of compensation  travel and overhead costs of personnel conducting research and development of our products and services  and consulting costs 
our research and development team works primarily on projects to improve and enhance user interface  product functionality  disambiguation  scalability and performance 
we generally expect that our research and development expenses will decline as a percentage of revenue as we grow our revenue 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of compensation  travel and overhead costs of sales and marketing and product management personnel  public relations  marketing and market information services  and advertising and promotional costs 
we generally expect that our sales and marketing expenses will decline as a percentage of revenue as we grow our revenue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  travel and overhead costs for financial  legal and administrative personnel  insurance fees  fees for professional services  including investor relations  legal  accounting and other consulting fees  investment banking fees  amortization of domain names  and other general corporate expenses 
overhead costs consist primarily of rent  telecommunications  utilities and depreciation expenses 
we generally expect that our general and administrative expenses will decline as a percentage of revenue as we grow our revenue 
however  in the first quarter of  we will be recording a charge of approximately million to reflect various costs we incurred in connection with the termination of the acquisition of lexico and the follow on offering of securities 
stock based compensation new employees typically receive stock option awards within three months of their start date 
we also grant additional stock option awards to existing employees and directors  usually once a year 
as of january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payments  or sfas r  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period awards are expected to vest 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors under the intrinsic value method  which followed the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
the intrinsic value method of accounting resulted in compensation expense for stock options to employees and directors to the extent option exercise prices were set below the market value of the company s stock on the date of grant 
costs resulting from stock based compensation are part of our compensation expense and are included in the operating expense categories in our statement of operations 
other compensation charges in connection with our purchase of brainboost  we issued shares of common stock  valued at approximately million  which were deemed to be compensation for services 
accordingly  million was charged to compensation expense over the six month period ending may  other interest income net interest income  net primarily consists of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalent and investment securities balances 
other expenses other expenses consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
in  other expenses included a payment of thousand to the sellers of brainboost as a result of our delay registering with the sec shares we issued as consideration in the transaction 
income tax expense our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate due to differences between income and expense recognition prescribed by income tax regulations and generally accepted accounting principles 
we utilize different methods and useful lives for depreciating and amortizing property  equipment and intangible assets and different methods and timing for calculating and recording stock compensation expense and other accruals 
furthermore  permanent differences arise from certain income and expense items recorded for financial reporting purposes but not recognizable for income tax purposes 
in addition  our income tax expense has been adjusted for the effect of state and local taxes and foreign income from our wholly owned subsidiary 
our deferred tax assets are primarily offset by a valuation allowance because realization depends on generating future taxable income  which  in our estimation  is not more likely than not to transpire 
our israeli subsidiary had income in  and  resulting from the services agreement we entered into with such israeli subsidiary 
pursuant to this agreement  the israeli subsidiary charges us for research and development services it provides us  plus 
however  the subsidiary is an approved enterprise under israeli law  which means that income arising from the subsidiary s approved activities is subject to zero tax under the alternative benefit path for a period of ten years 
currently  the subsidiary operates under two separate approved enterprise plans  ending december  and december   respectively 
in the event of distributions by the subsidiary to the parent  the subsidiary would have to pay a corporate tax on the amount distributed  and the recipient would have to pay a tax to be withheld at source on the amounts of such distribution received 
at present  we do not plan on having the subsidiary distribute a dividend to answers corporation

income tax expense benefit we had net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  for federal income tax purposes of approximately million at december   approximately million at december   and approximately million at december  the federal net operating losses will expire if not utilized on various dates from through because we have experienced one or more ownership changes  within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  an annual limitation is imposed on our ability to use million of these carryforwards 
our best estimate at this time is that the annual limitation on the use of million of our nols is approximately million per year 
any unused portion of the million annual limitation applicable to our restricted nols is available for use in future years until such nols are scheduled to expire 
our remaining nols are not currently subject to such limitations

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents  and investment securities which were  thousand as of december  in we used thousand in cash from our operations 
we have used cash in our operations in every year since our inception

cash flow provided by financing activities in and relates to the net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
future operations as a result of the cancellation of our proposed public offering on february  and the termination of the lexico purchase agreement on march   we will have to make cash payments of approximately  thousand in the first quarter of  in addition to the thousand we already expended in  for fees and costs relating to the unsuccessful acquisition and public offering 
these payments will have a material impact on the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities 
additionally  we expect that the collocation hosting facility we are establishing in will require an outlay of approximately million in capital expenditures in notwithstanding  we believe we have sufficient cash to meet our planned operating needs for the next twelve months  based on our current cash levels and expected cash flow from operations in however  our business strategy includes growth through additional business combinations and licensing or acquiring products and technologies complementary to our business  which could require use of a significant amount of our available cash and raising additional capital 
we may therefore need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to finance such initiatives 
however  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience significant dilution

our revenue is denominated solely in us dollars 
most of our expenses are also based in us dollars  however  we have a significant amount of expenses that are denominated in new israeli shekels  or nis

if the value of the us dollar further weakens against the value of nis  there will be a negative impact on our results of operations 
in addition  to the extent we hold cash and cash equivalents that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  we are subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
we use various hedging tools  including forward contracts and options  to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on our income 
other market risk 
as of december   almost all of our excess cash was invested in money market accounts that we believe has no material exposure to the principal amount nor to interest rate risk 
however  prior to then  we did invest much of our excess cash in various highly liquid investments including auction rate  investment grade  corporate and municipal debt instruments  and auction rate preferred shares of closed end investment funds that invest in long term fixed income securities  with auction reset periods ars s of days 
recently  many holders of ars instruments have experienced a liquidity crisis due to the lack of sufficient demand for the securities on the reset dates 
while we did hold some ars s as of december   we did not experience a loss upon the sale of those securities in the first quarter of currently  we do not own any ars s  and we are monitoring the situation  but in the interim we have ceased making any investments in ars s 
critical accounting estimates while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets we account for our purchases of acquired companies in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  or sfas  and for goodwill and other identifiable definite and indefinite lived acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas additionally  we review our long lived assets for recoverability in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas the identification and valuation of intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition are based on various valuation methodologies including reviews of projected future cash flows 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets  and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 
further  changes in business strategy and or market conditions may significantly impact these judgments thereby impacting the fair value of these assets  which could result in an impairment of the goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
we evaluate our long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  with the annual impairment testing date set at september  and in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
while we use available information to prepare our estimates and to perform impairment evaluations  the completion of annual impairment tests requires significant management judgments and estimates 
in response to the search engine algorithm adjustment by google in july  we examined what impact this event might have on the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with the guidance contained in sfas and as a result of our analysis  we concluded that the carrying value of our assets has not been impaired 
however  while we use available information to prepare our estimates and to perform impairment evaluations  our recoverability calculations and impairment tests require significant management judgment and estimates 
these estimates include our projections of undiscounted cash flows and assumptions used in calculating projected rpm growth  page views  and expenses 
in addition  a certain degree of judgment was exercised in determining asset groups in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
had our estimates and assumptions differed  the accounting treatment might have resulted differently 
future actual results could differ significantly from the anticipated results as reflected in our analysis 
accounting for stock based compensation as of january   we adopted sfas no 
r which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest  using the modified prospective method 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider various factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including historical experience 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
with the exception of stock options granted to employees prior to may   the date of our first filing with the us securities and exchange commission in connection with our initial public offering  or ipo  we determine the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the black scholes valuation model  which considers the exercise price relative to the market value of the underlying stock  the expected stock price volatility  the risk free interest rate and the dividend yield  and the estimated period of time option grants will be outstanding before they are ultimately exercised 
we also determine the fair value of stock options and warrants granted to non employees  for accounting purposes  using the black scholes valuation model 
prior to our ipo  in october  the market value of the underlying stock was based on estimates  including volatility estimates that are inherently highly uncertain and subjective  since prior to our ipo there had been no public market for our stock 
subsequent to our ipo  we did not have sufficient history to actually predict our volatility  therefore  our assumptions about stock price volatility were based on the volatility rates of comparable publicly held companies 
these rates may or may not reflect our actual stock price volatility 
beginning  our assumptions about our stock price volatility are based on a rate that we derived by taking into consideration the volatility rates of comparable publicly held companies as well as our own historical volatility rates 
in future periods and as we accumulate our own volatility history over longer periods of time  we will increase the weighting of our own volatility history in calculating expected volatility 
had we made different assumptions about the market value of our stock  stock price volatility or the estimated time option and warrant grants will be outstanding before they are ultimately exercised  the related stock based compensation expense and our net loss and net loss per share amounts could have been significantly different  in and  as well as in periods prior to our adoption of sfas r 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have almost fully offset our us net deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance 
our lack of earnings history and the uncertainty surrounding our ability to generate us taxable income prior to the expiration of such deferred tax assets were the primary factors considered by management in establishing the valuation allowance 
in july  fasb released fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  or fin  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fin prescribes how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
additionally  for tax positions to qualify for tax benefit recognition under fin  the position must have at least a more likely than not chance of being sustained upon a challenge by the respective taxing authorities 
we adopted the provisions of fin as of january  and it has not had a material impact on our financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  in february  the fasb approved fsp fas b which grants a one year deferral of sfas s fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
effective for  we will adopt sfas except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in fsp fas b 
the partial adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which allows an entity to choose to measure certain financial instruments and liabilities at fair value 
subsequent measurements for the financial instruments and liabilities an entity elects to fair value will be recognized in earnings 
sfas also establishes additional disclosure requirements 
sfas is effective beginning january  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of sfas on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas  which broadly affect the accounting for business combinations 
both statements are effective for periods beginning on or after december   and earlier adoption is prohibited 
sfas r will be applied to business combinations occurring after the effective date and sfas will be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests  including any that arose before the effective date 
the adoption of sfas r and sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

com rpm wikianswers rpm the and quarterly financial results as previously presented by us in reports and sec filings  have been modified to account for an immaterial error in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations and deferred taxes on the consolidated balance sheets involving an over accrual of deferred income taxes relating to our subsidiary s accumulated earnings  as a result of applying the distributed tax rate as opposed to the undistributed tax rate 
we define adjusted ebitda as net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  foreign currency exchange rate differences and certain non recurring revenues and expenses 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors because these measures enhance their overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects of our ongoing business operations 
by reporting adjusted ebitda  we provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between current  past and future periods 
adjusted ebitda is used by our management team to plan and forecast our business because it removes the impact of our capital structure interest expense  asset base amortization and depreciation  stock based compensation expenses  taxes  foreign currency exchange rate differences and certain non recurring revenues and expenses from our results of operations 
more specifically  we believe that removing these impacts is important for several reasons adjusted ebitda disregards amortization of intangible assets and other specified costs resulting from acquisitions 
specifically  we exclude a amortization of acquired technology from our acquisition of brainboost technology  llc  or brainboost  developer of the brainboost answer engine  which has been integrated into our answers from the web technology  b compensation expense resulting from the portion of the stock component of the brainboost purchase price that was deemed compensation expense  c penalty payments to the sellers of brainboost resulting from failure to timely register the common stock they received in connection with the acquisition  and d amortization of intangible assets relating to our acquisition of wikianswers 
we believe that excluding these expenses is helpful to investors  due to the fact that they relate to prior acquisitions and are not necessarily indicative of future operating expenses 
while we exclude these expenses from adjusted ebitda we do not exclude the revenue derived from the acquisitions 
the revenue attributable to wikianswers 
com in and was  thousand and thousand  respectively 
the revenue attributable to our acquisition of the brainboost technology is not quantifiable due to the nature of its integration 
we believe that  because of the variety of equity awards used by companies  the varying methodologies for determining stock based compensation expense  and the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations  excluding stock based compensation from adjusted ebitda enhances the ability of management and investors to compare financial results over multiple periods 
we believe that  excluding depreciation  interest  foreign currency exchange rate differences and taxes from adjusted ebitda provides investors with additional information to measure our performance  by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense  asset composition  and tax positions 
prior to december  we sold lifetime subscriptions to our gurunet service  generally for per subscription 
in december  we decided to alter our pricing model and moved to an annual subscription model  for which we generally charged our subscribers per year 
we have not sold subscriptions since our launch of answers 
com in january in february  we terminated the gurunet service and recognized thousand of deferred revenue as revenue during the quarter ended march  we believe that the recognition of the thousand of revenue is a one time  non cash event and is not reflective of our core business and core operating results  and we have therefore excluded this amount from adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of liquidity or financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  a measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
investors are cautioned that there are inherent limitations associated with the use of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool 
some of these limitations are non gaap financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles  many of the adjustments to adjusted ebitda reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future  other companies  including other companies in our industry  may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than us  thus limiting its usefulness as a comparative tool  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the periodic costs of certain tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in our cash and investment securities and the results of our investments  adjusted ebitda excludes taxes  which is an integral cost to most businesses  and because adjusted ebitda does not include stock based compensation  it does not reflect the cost of granting employees equity awards  a key factor in management s ability to hire and retain employees 
we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information in the reconciliation to the gaap amounts excluded from adjusted ebitda

based on our investment policy  such instruments are highly rated by rating agencies and therefore we believe that there is no material exposure to the principal amount nor to interest rate risks arising from these longer term investments
