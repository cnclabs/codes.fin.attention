item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly in risk factors 
overview we have developed the first and only commercially available intelligent robotic radiosurgery system  the cyberknife system  designed to treat solid tumors anywhere in the body as an alternative to traditional surgery 
the cyberknife system combines continuous image guidance technology with a compact linear accelerator that has the ability to move in three dimensions according to the treatment plan 
our image guidance technology continuously acquires images to track a tumor s location and transmits any position corrections to the robotic arm prior to delivery of each dose of radiation 
our compact linear accelerator  or linac  is a compact radiation treatment device that uses microwaves to accelerate electrons to create high energy x ray beams to destroy the tumor 
this combination  which we refer to as intelligent robotics  extends the benefits of radiosurgery to the treatment of tumors anywhere in the body 
the cyberknife system autonomously tracks  detects and corrects for tumor and patient movement in real time during the procedure  enabling delivery of precise  high dose radiation typically with sub millimeter accuracy 
the cyberknife procedure requires no anesthesia  can be performed on an outpatient basis and allows for the treatment of patients that otherwise would not have been treated with radiation or who may not have been good candidates for surgery 
in addition  the cyberknife procedure avoids many of the potential risks and complications that are associated with other treatment options and is more cost effective than traditional surgery 
in july  we obtained k clearance from the fda to market the cyberknife system for the treatment of tumors and certain other conditions in the head  neck and upper spine 
in august  we received fda clearance for the treatment of tumors anywhere in the body where radiation treatment is indicated 
in september  we received a ce mark for the sale of the cyberknife system in europe 
we received approval for full body treatment in japan in june  previously our cyberknife regulatory approvals in japan were limited to treatment for indications in the head and neck 
the cyberknife system has also been approved for various indications in korea  taiwan  china and other countries 
our customers have reported that over  patients worldwide have been treated with the cyberknife system since its commercial introduction 
in the united states  we sell to customers  including hospitals and stand alone treatment facilities  directly through our sales organization 
outside the united states  we sell to customers in over countries directly and through distributors 
we have sales and service offices in paris  france  hong kong  china  tokyo  japan  madrid  spain  new delhi  india and singapore 
as of june   we had sales personnel in our sales organization 
our cyberknife systems are either sold to our customers or placed with our customers pursuant to our shared ownership program 
as of june   we had cyberknife systems installed at customer sites  including sold and three pursuant to our shared ownership program 
of the systems sold and installed  are in the americas  are in asia and are in europe 
under our shared ownership program  we retain title to the cyberknife system while the customer has use of the system 
our shared ownership contracts generally require a minimum monthly payment from the customer  and we may earn additional revenue through the use of the system at the site 
generally  minimum monthly payments are equivalent to the revenue generated from treating three to four patients per month  and any revenue received from additional patients is shared between us and the customer 
we expect to continue to offer our shared ownership program to new customers and believe the number of installed units pursuant to and revenue from our shared ownership program to increase in future periods  but to decrease as a percentage of total revenue as we recognize more revenue from cyberknife systems sold to customers 
the shared ownership program typically has a term of five years  during which the customer has the option to purchase the system at pre determined prices 
at june   we had three systems installed under our shared ownership program 
during the years ended june  and  million and million  respectively  of total revenue was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the sale of and one cyberknife system units  respectively  that were formerly under our shared ownership program 
at june  and  million and  respectively  of amounts for extended warranty and training services related to these sold shared ownership units remained recorded as deferred revenue  and will be recognized over the life of the extended warranty service period and as training service obligations are fulfilled 
we manufacture and assemble our cyberknife systems at our manufacturing facility in sunnyvale  california 
we purchase major components  including the robotic manipulator  the treatment table or robotic couch  the magnetron  which creates the microwaves for use in the linear accelerator  the imaging cameras and the computers  from outside suppliers  some of which are single source 
our reliance on single source suppliers could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely and cost effective manner 
however  in most cases  if a supplier were unable to deliver these components  we believe that we would be able to find other sources for these components subject to any regulatory qualifications  if required 
we manufacture certain other electronic and electrical subsystems  including the linear accelerator 
we then assemble and integrate these components with our proprietary software and perform testing prior to shipment to customer sites 
we generate revenue by selling the cyberknife system and by providing ongoing services and upgrades to customers following installation of the cyberknife system 
the current united states list price for the cyberknife system ranges from approximately million to million depending upon system configuration and options purchased by the customer 
the list price typically includes initial training  installation  and a one year warranty 
we also offer optional hardware and software  technical enhancements and upgrades to the cyberknife system  as part of our multiyear service plans 
currently  our most comprehensive service plan is our diamond elite multiyear service plan  or diamond plan 
under our diamond plan  customers are eligible to receive up to two upgrades per year  when and if available 
through june   the diamond plan listed for  per year and provided for annual renewals for four years including the one year warranty period 
effective july   the diamond plan lists for  per year and provides for annual renewals for five years including the one year warranty period 
the customer may cancel the service plan at any time 
as of june   of our customers had purchased service plans 
prior to introducing our diamond plan  we offered legacy service plans  some of which continue to have future upgrade obligations 
in these cases  revenue  including cyberknife product revenue  is recognized ratably over the remaining life of the contract once all upgrade obligations have been satisfied 
the cyberknife procedure is currently covered and reimbursed by medicare and other governmental and non governmental third party payors 
medicare coverage currently exists in the hospital outpatient setting and in the free standing clinic setting 
for  the cms issued a final rule that resulted in a downward adjustment to the reimbursement rates for treatments using our technology in the hospital outpatient department 
for  under the finalized medicare payment rules  the national payment rates for procedures billed using medicare billing codes for treatments using the cyberknife system are  for the first treatment and  for each treatment thereafter  up to a maximum of five treatments  which is an approximately to percent reduction as compared to payment rates 
the implementation of this reimbursement reduction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for the year ended june  for the calendar year  cms has published increased payment rates as compared to the published rates for the calendar year are  for the first treatment and  for each treatment thereafter 
in july  cms issued proposed payment rates under these codes for the proposed payment rate under hcpcs code g for is  and the proposed payment rate under code g for is  we do not anticipate a significant impact of this rule on our business or results of operations 
our total net revenue was million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
our net income loss was million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
our net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
as of june   our backlog as discussed under backlog  was approximately million 
the contingent portion of backlog was million at june  contingent backlog consists of backlog under contracts that are subject to the satisfaction of contingencies prior to the customer becoming legally bound to proceed with the acquisition of a cyberknife system 
the non contingent portion of backlog was million at june  our future success will depend in large part on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in the market 
to compete successfully  we will need to continue to demonstrate the advantages of our products and technologies over alternative procedures  products and technologies  and convince physicians and other healthcare decision makers of the advantages of our products and technologies 
our business and sales and installation cycle does not immediately create recognizable revenue 
as such  we must invest in sales and marketing activities up to months prior to realizing the revenue from those activities 
our ability to achieve and maintain long term profitability is largely dependent on our ability to successfully market and sell the cyberknife system and to control our costs and effectively manage our growth 
material weakness in internal controls in connection with our evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting  we identified a material weakness relating to accounting for revenue transactions 
our efforts to remediate this material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting consist of the following corrective actions i hiring and training additional  qualified finance and accounting personnel  and ii strengthening our processes and procedures related to complex revenue recognition transactions 
however  even after these corrective actions are implemented  the effectiveness of our controls and procedures may be limited by a variety of risks 
although we have taken measures to remediate previously reported material weaknesses as well as other significant deficiencies and control deficiencies  we cannot assure you that we have identified all  or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses  significant deficiencies and control deficiencies 
financial operations sales and installation cycle the cyberknife system has a relatively long sales and installation cycle because it is a major capital item and requires the approval of senior management at purchasing institutions 
the typical sales and installation cycle is up to months in duration and involves multiple steps 
initial steps may include pre selling activity followed by sales presentations and other sales related activities 
after the customer has expressed an intention to purchase a cyberknife system  we typically negotiate and enter into a terms agreement setting forth the business and economic terms for the sale or acquisition of the cyberknife system and multiyear service plan 
after execution of a terms agreement  the customer typically has a specified time window in which to complete final negotiation of legal terms for the sale or acquisition of the cyberknife system 
we bifurcated the process of negotiating agreements on business and legal terms in order to reduce the level of sales force involvement in negotiation of legal terms and improve the efficiency of our customer contracting process 
nevertheless  many customers  particularly in international markets  opt to negotiate a full purchase agreement at the time of sale 
the last step in the sales and installation cycle is installation of the cyberknife system 
prior to installation  a purchasing institution must typically obtain a radiation device installation permit  and in some cases  a certificate of need  or con  both of which must be granted by state and local government bodies 
recently  as a result of healthcare cost considerations and sensitivity to the cost of major capital equipment items  some state con boards have become more aggressive in the evaluation of con applications 
this trend  if it continues  may make the con process more protracted and uncertain 
in addition  the purchasing institution must build a radiation shielded facility or upgrade an existing facility to house the cyberknife system 
we typically receive a deposit at the time the terms agreement or full purchase agreement is entered into  or shortly thereafter  and the remaining balance for the sale of the cyberknife system upon delivery and installation 
the customer also typically selects a service plan at the time of signing a cyberknife system terms agreement and enters into the service plan agreement prior to installation of the system 
upon installation  we typically recognize the cyberknife system sale price less the fair value of one year of service 
we recognize the fair value of the first year of service as revenue pro rata over the twelve months following installation 
in addition  if the customer has purchased our diamond plan and assuming annual renewals  we would receive payment at the beginning of each of the second  third and fourth years of the multiyear service plan and recognize that revenue pro rata over each year 
legacy service plans prior to introducing our diamond plan  we offered a platinum elite multiyear service plan  or platinum plan 
these legacy service plans were structured so that we have an obligation to deliver two upgrades per year over the course of the multiyear service plan 
if we fail to deliver the upgrades  our customers are entitled to receive a refund of up to  for each upgrade not offered 
beginning in november  we phased out offering these legacy service plans to new customers 
the platinum plan obligates us to deliver two upgrades per year during the term of the contract 
we have not established fair value for those future obligations  hence  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires that we cannot begin to recognize any of the revenue derived from the sale of the cyberknife system or the associated service plans until all upgrade obligations have been fulfilled 
therefore  the payments made by our customers who have our legacy platinum plan are categorized as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue after we fulfill all obligations to deliver upgrades 
once we fulfill all upgrade obligations with respect to a specific platinum plan  we ratably recognize the revenue from the sale of the cyberknife system and the platinum plan over the remaining life of the contract 
upgrades customers may purchase additional upgrades as optional extras prior to the delivery of all originally specified upgrade obligations 
such additional upgrades are considered elements of the original arrangement and associated revenues are deferred until the earlier of delivery of all elements  or establishment of vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements 
sales of additional upgrades after delivery of all specified upgrade obligations  as stated in the original contract  are considered separate arrangements and are recognized once all revenue recognition criteria applicable to the separate arrangements are met 
warranty all customers purchasing a cyberknife system receive a one year warranty 
in circumstances where we have vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements  we recognize the cyberknife system purchase price minus the fair value of one year of support upon installation  and we recognize the value of one year of support ratably over the twelve months following installation 
shared ownership program revenue as of june   our shared ownership program involved us sites only 
we recognize revenue monthly from our shared ownership program that consists of a minimum monthly payment 
we also recognize usage based revenue in excess of the monthly minimum based on usage reports from our customers 
we recognized revenue from our shared ownership program of million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
in limited cases  we received nonrefundable upfront payments from shared ownership program customers which are treated as deferred revenue and recognized over the term of the contract 
the cyberknife system shared ownership systems are recorded within property and equipment and are depreciated over their estimated life of ten years 
depreciation and warranty expense attributable to shared ownership systems are recorded within cost of shared ownership program as they are incurred 
japan customized service revenue in may and december  we entered into separate contractual arrangements to deliver customized upgrade services to our distributor in japan for cyberknife systems previously sold 
these customized upgrade services consist of two upgrade levels and are being delivered over an extended period concurrent with the distributor s efforts to coordinate delivery with their end user customers 
once the obligations under the upgrade programs for these systems are complete  we do not plan to offer this customized service program and will instead be offering our standard multiyear service plans 
international sales revenue for international sales  we recognize revenue once we have met all of our obligations associated with the purchase agreement  other than for undelivered service elements for which we have vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value 
in most cases  this occurs after the distributor has shipped the unit to the end user  assuming all of our remaining obligations have been satisfied 
payments are sometimes secured through letters of credit 
in situations where we are directly responsible for installation  we recognize revenue once we have installed the cyberknife system and have confirmed performance against specification 
in situations with legacy plans where we have future obligations related to software upgrades that are subject to potential refunds  we defer revenue from the sale and service of the cyberknife system until the final upgrade has been delivered and accepted 
after we have delivered all upgrades associated with a service plan and thus eliminated any contractual right to a refund  we ratably recognize the revenue from the sale of the cyberknife system and the plan over the remaining life of the contract or until we have vsoe of the fair value of remaining undelivered elements 
net revenue from international customers was million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
backlog backlog consists of the sum of deferred revenue  future payments that our customers are contractually committed to make and signed contingent contracts that we believe have a substantially high probability of being booked as revenue from cyberknife system sale agreements  service plans and minimum payment requirements associated with our shared ownership program 
contingencies associated with contingent contracts that are included within backlog may include state or local government approval of a certificate of need for the installation of a radiosurgery system  approval by the board of directors of the hospital or other purchaser of the system and establishment of financing and formation of legal entities by purchasers of systems and  in the case of terms agreements  final negotiation and agreement upon our legal terms for the purchase or acquisition of the cyberknife system 
in addition  in some cases in which customers negotiate full purchase agreements  these agreements are also subject to certain contingencies 
we review  on a quarterly basis with respect to each contingent contract included in backlog  whether customer engagement and progress toward satisfaction of contingencies warrant continued inclusion of the contract within backlog 
as of june   our backlog  as defined above  was approximately million 
of the total backlog  million represented cyberknife system sales  and million represented revenue from service plans and other recurring revenues 
the contingent portion of backlog was million at june  contingent backlog consists of backlog under contracts that are subject to the satisfaction of contingencies prior to the customer becoming legally bound to proceed with the acquisition of a cyberknife system 
the non contingent portion of backlog was million at june  we anticipate that this backlog will be recognized over the next five years as installations occur  upgrades are delivered and services are provided 
although backlog includes contractual commitments from our customers  we may be unable to convert this entire backlog  including the entire non contingent backlog  into recognized revenue due to factors outside our control 
results of operations overview our results of operations are divided into the following components net revenue 
our net revenue consists primarily of product revenue revenue derived primarily from the sale of cyberknife systems and the sale of linacs for other uses  shared ownership program revenue revenue generated from our shared ownership program  services revenue revenue generated from sales of service plans and training and other revenue revenue from specialized upgrade services for units previously sold in japan and other specialized services 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of material  labor and overhead costs 
in future periods we expect cost of revenue to decrease as a percentage of total net revenue due to anticipated higher margin product sales and increased absorption of manufacturing overhead costs associated with increased production volumes  improved efficiencies for supplies and materials and improved labor and manufacturing efficiencies 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs for personnel and costs associated with participation in medical conferences  physician symposia  and advertising and promotional activities 
in future periods  we expect selling and marketing expenses to grow in absolute terms as we increase headcount and further increase participation in trade shows and symposia and invest in other marketing and promotional activities  but to decrease as a percentage of total net revenue as we leverage our existing infrastructure and realize economies of scale 
marketing expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of major marketing events  such as significant trade shows 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of activities associated with our product development  regulatory  and clinical study arrangements 
in future periods  we expect research and development expenses to grow in absolute terms as we continue our investment in new technologies  enhancements to the cyberknife system  increased clinical studies  and as we increase headcount and development activities 
our objective is to manage growth in these expenditures such that they will decrease as a percentage of total net revenue as we leverage our existing infrastructure and realize economies of scale 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for finance  legal  and human resources  and external expenses related to accounting  legal and other consulting fees 
in future periods  we expect general and administrative expenses to grow in absolute terms as we incur additional costs related to the overall growth of our business 
our objective is to manage growth in these expenditures such that they will decrease as a percentage of total net revenue as we leverage our existing infrastructure and realize economies of scale 
interest and other income 
interest and other income consist primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 
we expect interest income to decrease in the near future in response to the recent decline in interest rates and lower invested cash balances 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense consist primarily of losses from the disposal of property and equipment  state and local sales and use taxes  interest payments and foreign currency transaction losses 
deferred revenue legacy multiyear service plans we are required to defer all of the revenue associated with our legacy multiyear service plans  including our platinum and gold service plans  until we have satisfied all of the specified obligations related to the delivery of upgrades to the cyberknife system during the life of the service plan 
this includes deferring the cash received for the purchase of the cyberknife system and multiyear service plans until we have delivered all upgrades which the customer is eligible to receive 
once we have satisfied our obligations for delivery of upgrades under the plans  we recognize revenue ratably over the remaining life of the service plan 
we have not offered these legacy multiyear service plans to new customers since we phased them out when we introduced our diamond plan in november  but continue to provide service for legacy plans as of june  therefore  our deferred revenue has been higher in certain periods where we have installed more units with legacy contracts  and it should decrease in future periods as we satisfy the contractual obligations and recognize the revenue associated with those installed units 
however  we do not anticipate receiving significant incremental cash flow from operations related to these legacy contracts 
years ended june   and net revenue 
years ended june  in thousands net revenue products shared ownership program services other total net revenue for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  during the year ended june   cyberknife system units were installed  including units sold and four attributable to our shared ownership program  compared to units installed  including units sold and two attributable to our shared ownership program in the year ended june  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy and reflecting the terms of our service plans  we recognized revenue associated with the sale of cyberknife system units  including units that had been in our shared ownership program  for the year ended june   compared to cyberknife system units  including one unit that had been in our shared ownership program  for the year ended june  product revenue for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to the sale of cyberknife systems that had been in our shared ownership program for an aggregate purchase price of million 
also  during the year ended june   we satisfied all revenue recognition criteria for seven units previously sold to a distributor in china and recognized million of non recurring product revenue related to these units 
as of june   revenue associated with these units was recorded in deferred revenue 
in addition  we recognize revenue ratably over the remaining lives of the service plans for those legacy multiyear service plans where we have satisfied our upgrade delivery obligations

we have recognized all of the product revenue attributable to these legacy multiyear plans for one system during each of the years ended june  and service revenue for the year ended june  increased approximately million from the year ended june   primarily attributable to an increase in the number of customer sites under service plans 
shared ownership program revenue for the year ended june  increased approximately  from the year ended june  we anticipate revenue from our shared ownership program will decrease in future periods due to the sale of units that had been in our shared ownership program through the year ended june  revenue from upgrade services in japan  classified as other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended june   increased approximately million from the year ended june  due to an increase in upgrade services provided to our installed systems in japan

in addition  we recognize revenue ratably over the remaining lives of the service plans for those legacy multiyear service plans where we have satisfied our upgrade delivery obligations 
during the years ended june  and  we recognized product revenue attributable to these legacy multiyear plans for units and one unit  respectively 
we had recognized all of the product revenues attributable to these legacy multiyear plans for one system during the year ended june  no units attributable to the legacy multiyear plans were fully recognized during the year ended june  shared ownership revenue for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june   primarily due to an increase in patient treatment volume at the existing sites as well as an increase in the number of shared ownership sites 
services revenue for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june   primarily attributable to an increase in the number of customer sites under service plans 
revenue from upgrade services in japan  classified as other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations  for the year ended june  decreased by  from the year ended june   due to a decrease in upgrade services provided to our installed systems in japan

years ended june  dollars in thousands cost of revenue of net revenue gross margin total cost of revenue for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to the sale of cyberknife system units that had been in our shared ownership program and an increased number of customer sites under service plans during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  as a percentage of total net revenue  total cost of revenue for the year ended june  increased to as compared to for the year ended june  the increase in total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue was due primarily to the sale of cyberknife systems previously in our shared ownership program  an increase in cyberknife system shipments through our distributor channel  and to a lesser extent  upgrade services provided to our installed systems in japan  which all typically have lower gross margins than conventional cyberknife unit sales 
total cost of revenue for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of cyberknife systems installed and recognized as revenue during fiscal year compared to fiscal year as a percentage of total net revenue  total cost of revenue for the year ended june  decreased to as compared to for the year ended june  the decrease in total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue from fiscal year to fiscal year was a result of improved absorption of manufacturing overhead costs associated with increased production volumes of cyberknife systems and the significant increase in product revenue from cyberknife unit sales  which typically has a lower cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue than other revenue streams 
selling and marketing expenses 
years ended june  dollars in thousands sales and marketing of net revenue selling and marketing expenses for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in salary and related costs  including stock based compensation  largely due to increased headcount and an increase of million in facility and operational costs as a result of the continuing expansion of our international sales presence 
selling and marketing expenses for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in salary and related costs  including stock based compensation  largely due to increased headcount  an increase of million in consulting expenses due to an increase in promotional activities  an increase of million in marketing and promotional activities  an increase of million in travel expense  and an increase of  in sales commissions expenses resulting from increased sales volume

interest and other income 
years ended june  dollars in thousands interest and other income of net revenue interest and other income for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to higher average daily balances kept in interest bearing accounts  as a result of receiving proceeds from our initial public offering  or ipo  in february  for months during the year ended june  compared to only five months during the year ended june  interest and other income for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from our ipo in february which resulted in higher average daily balances kept in interest bearing accounts for the five months following our ipo during the year ended june  interest and other expense 
years ended june  dollars in thousands interest and other expense of net revenue interest and other expense for the year ended june  was consistent with a slight decrease of  compared with year ended june  interest and other expense for the year ended june  increased  from the year ended june  the increase in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in loss from the disposal of property and equipment and an increase in loss from foreign exchange transactions  offset by a decrease in interest expense on advance payments received from third party financing arrangements in connection with our shared ownership program 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
for the year ended june   we recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  related to our adoption effective july   of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
r  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements nos 
and  or sfas r  related to our accounting for stock based compensation 
we had previously accounted for our stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  which permitted us to either estimate forfeitures in determining our stock based compensation expense or to adjust the expense at the time forfeitures occurred 
sfas r requires that we estimate forfeitures 
since we had previously adjusted our stock based compensation expense at the time forfeitures occurred  we have included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the adjustment to reflect forfeitures related to compensation expense recorded in prior periods 
provision for income taxes 
years ended june  dollars in thousands provision for income taxes of net revenue the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  decreased  from the year ended june  in fiscal  we recorded a decrease in foreign taxes of  as compared to the prior year as the result of the recognition of tax benefits associated with the utilization of foreign net operating losses 
we also recorded a decrease in federal and state alternative minimum taxes  or amt  of  primarily due to a decrease in taxable income resulting from an increase in stock option deductions available under sfas r in the current year and decreased recognition of revenue for tax purposes 
the provision for income taxes increased million from fiscal year to fiscal year we recorded an increase in foreign taxes of  as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased activity and higher net income in our foreign jurisdictions 
we also recorded an increase in federal and state amt of  primarily due to the increased recognition of revenue for tax purposes while such revenue was deferred for financial statement purposes 
as of june   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
these federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are available to offset against future taxable income  if any  in varying amounts and will begin to expire beginning in and for federal and state purposes  respectively 
such net operating loss carryforwards include excess tax benefits from employee option exercises that have not been recorded in our deferred tax assets  which is in accordance with sfas r 
we will record approximately million as a credit to additional paid in capital if and when such excess benefits are ultimately realized 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal tax credit carryforwards will expire in  while the state tax credits have no expiration date 
in addition  among other matters  realization of the entire deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforwards 
while we had taxable income in  based on the available objective evidence and the history of losses  we cannot conclude that the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our domestic and foreign net deferred tax assets 
at june   there was no provision for us income tax for undistributed earnings as it is currently our intention to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the us if repatriated  these earnings could result in a tax expense at the current us federal statutory tax rate of  subject to available net operating losses and other factors 
subject to limitation  tax on undistributed earnings may also be reduced by foreign tax credits that may be generated in connection with the repatriation of earnings 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  on july  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a detail description 
stock based compensation expense effective july   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date and b based on the previous requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under previous literature 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
stock based compensation expense was recorded net of estimated forfeitures for the years ended june  and such that expense was recorded only for those stock based awards that are expected to vest 
for the years ended june  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  for stock options  employee stock purchase plan  or espp  options and restricted stock units granted to employees 
for the year ended june   we recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  related to the adoption of sfas r since we had previously adjusted stock based compensation expense at the time forfeitures occurred in accordance with sfas the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle reflects estimated forfeitures related to periods prior to july  as of june   there was approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures  of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options  espp options and restricted stock units which we expect to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
prior to july   stock based compensation expense was reflected on our statement of operations in accordance with sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  or sfas in accordance with the requirements of sfas  we recorded deferred stock based compensation for the estimated fair value of options awarded on the date of grant 
this deferred stock based compensation was amortized to expense over the period during which the options become exercisable  generally four years 
during the year ended june  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense for stock options granted to employees 
during the years ended june   and  we recognized   and  of stock based compensation expense  respectively  for stock options granted to non employees 
for certain stock option grants  we made modifications to the option terms 
these modifications included extensions of the vesting period and acceleration of vesting 
during the years ended june   and  we recognized  and  of stock based compensation expense  respectively  for modifications of stock options granted 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended june   cash and cash equivalents decreased by million 
this decrease was primarily attributable to cash used in operating activities of million  stock repurchases of million and the investment of our excess cash and cash equivalents in higher yielding investment accounts 
short term investments amounted to million and none at june  and  respectively 
long term investments amounted to million and none at june  and  respectively 
we believe that we have sufficient cash resources and anticipated cash flows to continue in operation for at least the next months 
in february  we completed our initial public offering in which a total of  shares were sold  including  shares sold by selling stockholders at an initial public offering price of per share 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of million 
years ended june   and cash flows from operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended june  our net income of million during fiscal year was offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  of million  and an increase in inventories of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily a result of the timing difference between the shipment of products and the receipt of customer payment 
the decrease in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  was primarily a result of the timing of differences between invoicing customers under service contracts and the recognition of revenue over the contractual service period  the continued satisfaction of specified obligations to begin revenue recognition for units covered by our legacy service plans and the recognition of revenue and cost of revenue for units previously shipped to a distributor in china 
the increase in inventories was due primarily to an increase in our business volume 
non cash charges included million of stock based compensation and million of depreciation and amortization expense 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended june  our net loss of million during fiscal year was offset by non cash charges of million of depreciation and amortization expense  and million of stock based compensation offset by the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  due to the adoption of sfas r 
other significant working capital changes that contributed to positive cash flows provided by operations in fiscal included an increase in accounts payables of million  an increase in accrued liabilities of million and an increase in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue of million 
the increase in accounts payable was due to increases in the volume of our business and the increase in accrued liabilities was due to increases in compensation related accruals due to increased headcount 
the increase in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  was primarily a result of the timing differences between invoicing customers under service contracts and the recognition of revenue over the contractual service period  and the continued satisfaction of specified obligations to begin revenue recognition for units covered by our legacy service plans 
offsets to positive cashflow included an increase in inventories of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  and a decrease in customer advances of million due to an increase in the number of systems shipped 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended june  our net loss of million during fiscal was offset by a million increase in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  non cash charges of million related to stock based compensation charges and million of depreciation and amortization expense on purchases of property and equipment 
the increase in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  was primarily a result of the timing differences between invoicing customers under service contracts and the recognition of revenue over the contractual service period  and the continued satisfaction of specified obligations to begin revenue recognition for units covered by our legacy service plans 
other significant working capital changes that contributed to positive cash flow in fiscal year included an increase in customer advances of million due to increased payments made by customers in advance of product shipments and an increase in accrued liabilities of million primarily due to increases in accrued commissions on higher revenues and other compensation related accruals due to increased headcount 
significant working capital changes that offset positive cash flows in fiscal year included an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in inventory of million as a result of increased revenues and volumes of orders from our customers 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended june  and was attributable to net investment of our excess cash and cash equivalents in higher yielding investment accounts of million  which consisted of million of purchases and million of sales and maturities of marketable securities  million of purchases of property and equipment  and million of restricted cash activity 
the increase in investment activity during the year ended june  is due primarily to the january investment of proceeds from our initial public offering in february the increase in restricted cash is due to arrangements in contracts with customers requiring that deposited cash amounts be secured via letter of credit until delivery of the cyberknife unit occurs 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended june   which was primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended june  the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of million 
purchases of property and equipment in all periods were due to the expansion of our facilities and operations 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended june  and was primarily attributable to stock repurchases of million  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of million and proceeds from our espp of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended june  and was primarily attributable to net proceeds from our initial public offering of million and proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended june  and was primarily due to the payment of a note payable of million offset by proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and common stock warrants of  operating capital and capital expenditure requirements our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following revenue generated by sales of the cyberknife system  our shared ownership program and service plans  costs associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities  rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities  costs of obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances of the cyberknife system  effects of competing technological and market developments  and number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
if these sources of cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
additional financing may not be available at all  or in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table is a summary of our non cancelable contractual cash obligations  net of sublease income as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years in thousands operating leases sublease income total off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business and operating results during the periods presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies including the more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we earn revenue from the sale of our products  our shared ownership program  and the provision of related services  which can include installation services  post contract customer support  or pcs  training and consulting 
our products and upgrades to those products include software that is essential to the functionality of the products and accordingly  we account for the sale of our products pursuant to statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  or sop  as amended 
we recognize product revenues for sales of the cyberknife system  replacement parts and accessories when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable and delivery has occurred as prescribed by sop payments received in advance of product shipment are recorded as customer advances and are recognized as revenue or deferred revenue upon product shipment or installation 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate arrangement consideration to services and pcs based upon vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the respective elements 
vsoe of fair value for the services element is based upon our standard rates charged for the products or services when such products or services are sold separately or based upon the price established by management having the relevant authority when that service is not yet being sold separately 
when contracts contain multiple elements  and vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements  principally the cyberknife system  based upon the residual method as prescribed by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions  or sop if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all the undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until the earlier of delivery of all elements  or establishment of vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements 
cyberknife sales with legacy service plans for sales of cyberknife systems with pcs arrangements that include specified or committed upgrades for which we have not established vsoe of fair value  all revenue is deferred until the specified or committed upgrades are delivered 
in such cases  once all upgrade obligations have been delivered  all deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the remaining life of the pcs arrangement 
sales of additional upgrades as optional extras prior to the delivery of all originally specified upgrade obligations are considered additional elements of the original arrangement and associated revenues are deferred and accounted for as described above 
sales of additional upgrades after delivery of all specified upgrade obligations  as stated in the original contract  are recognized once all revenue recognition criteria applicable to those arrangements are met 
cyberknife sales with nonlegacy service plans in fiscal year  we began selling cyberknife systems with pcs contracts that only provide for upgrades when and if they become available 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of pcs in these circumstances 
for arrangements with multiple elements that include the cyberknife system  installation services  training services and a pcs service agreement  we recognize the cyberknife system and installation services revenue following installation and acceptance of the system by application of the residual method as prescribed in sop no 
when vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements in the arrangement  including pcs 
other revenue japan upgrade services other revenue primarily consists of upgrade revenues related to the sale of specialized services specifically contracted to provide current technology capabilities for units previously sold through a distributor into the japan market 
the upgrade programs include elements where vsoe of fair value has not been established for the pcs 
as a result  associated revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the pcs arrangement  generally four years 
pcs and maintenance services service revenue for providing pcs  which includes warranty services  extended warranty services  unspecified when and if available product updates and technical support is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period  generally one year  until no further obligation exists 
at the time of sale  we provide for the estimated incremental costs of meeting product warranty if the incremental warranty costs are expected to exceed the related service revenues 
training and consulting service revenues  that are not deemed essential to the functionality of the cyberknife system  are recognized as such services are performed 
costs associated with providing pcs and maintenance services are expensed when incurred  except when those costs are related to units where revenue recognition has been deferred 
in those cases  the costs are deferred until the recognition of the related revenue and are expensed over the period of revenue recognition 
distributor sales sales to third party distributors are evidenced by distribution agreements governing the relationships together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
we record revenues from sales of cyberknife systems to distributors based on a sell through method where revenue is only recognized upon shipment of the product to the end user customer and once all revenue recognition criteria are met including completion of all our obligations under the terms of the purchase order 
for sales of upgrades and accessories to distributors  revenue is recognized on either a sell through or sell in basis  depending upon the terms of the purchase order and once all revenue recognition criteria are met 
these criteria require that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and there is no right of return 
our agreements with customers and distributors generally do not contain product return rights 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we will defer the fee and recognize revenue upon receipt of cash 
shared ownership program we also enter into arrangements under our shared ownership program with certain customers 
under the terms of such program  we retain title to our cyberknife system  while the customer has use of the product 
we generally receive a minimum monthly payment and earn additional revenues from the customer based upon their use of the product 
we may provide unspecified upgrades to the product during the term of each program when and if available 
upfront  non refundable payments from the customer are deferred and recognized as revenue over the contractual period 
revenues from our shared ownership program are recorded as they become earned and receivable and are included within shared ownership program revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
the cyberknife systems associated with our shared ownership program are recorded within property and equipment and are depreciated over their estimated useful life of ten years 
depreciation and warranty expense attributable to the cyberknife shared ownership systems are recorded within cost of our shared ownership program 
long term manufacturing contracts we also recognize revenue and cost of revenue related to long term manufacturing contracts using contract accounting on the percentage of completion method in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize any loss provisions from the total contract in the period such loss is identified 
during the years ended june    and  contract revenue of million  and  respectively  was recorded in other revenue with related costs of  and  respectively  recorded in cost of other revenue 
as of june  and  costs of million and  respectively were recorded in deferred cost of revenue related to the contract manufacture of non medical linacs 
deferred revenue and deferred cost of revenue deferred revenue consists of deferred product revenue  deferred shared ownership revenue  deferred service revenue and deferred other revenue 
deferred product revenue arises from the timing differences between the shipment of products and satisfaction of all revenue recognition criteria consistent with our revenue recognition policy 
deferred shared ownership revenue results from the receipt of advance payments of monthly minimum lease payments  which will be recognized ratably over the term of the shared ownership program 
deferred service revenue results from the advance payment for services to be delivered over a period of time  usually one year 
service revenue is recognized ratably over the service period 
deferred other revenue results primarily from the japan upgrade services programs and is due to timing difference between the receipt of cash payments for those upgrades and final delivery to the end user customer 
deferred cost of revenue consists of the direct costs associated with the manufacture of units  direct service costs and deferred costs associated with the japan upgrade services for which the revenue has been deferred in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
deferred revenue  and associated deferred cost of revenue  expected to be realized within one year are classified as current liabilities and current assets  respectively 
stock based compensation prior to adoption of sfas r effective july   we began to account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with sfas and sfas under sfas  stock based compensation expense is measured on the date of grant based on the fair value of the award 
upon adoption of this standard  we elected to use the retrospective restatement method of transition 
we believe that the fair value of the stock options is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the services received 
we determined the estimated fair value of our common stock in light of the expected completion of its initial public offering 
we engaged an unrelated third party appraisal firm to assist management in this process by providing a valuation analysis 
the estimated fair value of stock options granted is calculated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  as prescribed by sfas  using fair values of common stock between and per share and the following weighted average assumptions during the year ended june  year ended june  risk free interest rate dividend yield expected life expected volatility in accordance with the requirements of sfas  we recorded deferred stock based compensation for the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant 
this deferred stock based compensation was amortized to expense over the period during which the options become exercisable  generally four years 
during the year ended june   we reversed million of deferred stock based compensation related to cancellations of unvested options of certain employees who had been granted stock options and subsequently terminated their employment with the company 
during the year ended june   we amortized million of stock based compensation expense for stock options granted to employees 
for certain stock option grants  we made modifications to the option terms 
those modifications included extensions of the vesting period and acceleration of vesting 
the company recognized  and  during the years ended june    and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense for modifications of stock options granted 
adoption of sfas r effective july   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date and b based on the previous requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under previous guidance 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
stock based compensation expense was recorded net of estimated forfeitures for the years ended june  and such that expense was recorded only for those stock based awards that are expected to vest 
for the year ended june   we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  net of tax of  related to the adoption of sfas r since we had previously adjusted stock based compensation expense at the time forfeitures occurred in accordance with sfas the cumulative effect of this change in accounting reflects estimated forfeitures related to periods prior to july  under sfas r  we estimated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using the assumptions noted in the table below 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly traded companies 
the expected term of options is based upon the vesting term ie  on the first anniversary of the vesting start date and equal monthly installments thereafter and on its partial life history 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury constant maturity rate 
during the years ended june  and  the estimated fair values of the stock options granted were calculated at each date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  using fair values of common stock between and per share 
following our ipo  the fair value of our common stock is determined by its closing market price as published by the nasdaq global market 
during the years ended june  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense for stock options granted to employees 
the weighted average assumptions used to value options granted during the years ended june  and were as follows years ended june  risk free interest rate dividend yield expected life expected volatility stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to non employees is recognized as the stock options are earned in accordance with sfas and emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
we believe that the fair value of the stock options is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the services received 
the estimated fair value of the stock options granted is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  as prescribed by sfas  using fair values of common stock and weighted average assumptions during the year of grant 
we recognized   and  during the years ended june    and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense for stock options granted to non employees 
in january  in connection with our ipo  the board of directors approved the incentive award plan  or plan  and the espp 
the espp is deemed compensatory and compensation costs are accounted for under sfas r 
under the espp  qualified employees are entitled to purchase common stock at of the fair market value on specified dates 
the estimated fair value of espp shares was calculated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  using a fair value of common stock between per share and per share for the year ended june  and per share for the year ended june  expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly traded companies 
the expected term is based upon the offering period of the espp 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the espp option is based on the us treasury constant maturity rate 
for the years ended june  and  we recognized million and  of compensation expense related to our espp  respectively 
the following weighted average assumptions were used during the years ended june  and years ended june  risk free interest rate dividend yield expected life expected volatility in connection with the plan  we issued restricted stock units  or rsu s  and recognized million and million of stock based compensation expense  net of forfeitures for restricted stock units granted during the years ended june  and  at a weighted average grant date fair value of and  respectively 
excess tax benefits from tax deductions for exercised options and disqualifying dispositions  in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock compensation costs for such options are credited to additional paid in capital 
realized excess tax benefits for the years ended june  and were  and  respectively 
at june    of capitalized stock based compensation costs were included as components of inventory and deferred cost of revenue 
no significant costs were capitalized at june  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
excess and obsolete inventories are written down based on historical sales and forecasted demand  as judged by management 
we determine inventory and product costs  which include allocated production overheads  through use of standard costs which approximate actual average costs 
investments our investments include short term securities which include fixed income securities  commercial paper  term notes and marketable debt securities 
all investments are designated as available for sale and are therefore reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are recorded in other income expense 
investments with original maturities greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short term investments 
long term investments include us corporate debt securities with maturities beyond one year and auction rate securities for which auctions were recently unsuccessful 
we continue to hold these auction rate securities until a future auction for these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process  which may occur beyond one year 
short term investments amounted to million and none at june  and  respectively 
long term investments amounted to million and none at june  and  respectively 
as of june   we held million in interest bearing auction rate securities  or ars  that represented investments in student loan obligations 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our holdings in ars investments and multiple auctions for these securities have been unsuccessful 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we may not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
all of the ars investments are aaa rated and were in compliance with our investment policy at the time of acquisition 
we currently have the ability and intent to hold these ars investments until a recovery of the auction process or until maturity  which is generally greater than months 
as of june   the entire ars investment balance is classified as long term investments on our consolidated balance sheet because of our inability to determine when our investments in ars would settle 
in may  we modified our investment policy with the objective of increasing our investments in more liquid money market investments and to preclude any additional exposure to auction rate securities 
typically the fair value of ars investments approximates par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of these investments no longer approximates par value 
we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of june  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of june  we determined there was a temporary decline in the fair value of its ars investments of million  which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheet at that date 
we review impairments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance issued by the fasb and sec in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations and reduces net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
in evaluating the impairment of any individual ars  we classified such impairment as temporary 
if our assessment of the fair value in future periods is other than temporary  we would record an impairment charge through our statement of operations 
provision for income taxes estimates and significant management judgment are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards 
due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize our deferred tax assets  we record a valuation allowance equal to the amount of our net deferred tax assets 
if we subsequently determine that it is more likely than not we will be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets  we will record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a credit to earnings in the period such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb staff position  or fsp  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas   determination of the useful life of intangible assets  which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of intangible assets under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets

item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions 
for direct sales outside the united states it is likely we will sell in the local currency 
for the year ended june   all of our executed sales contracts were denominated in us dollars  with the exception of three sales contracts denominated in euros 
future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products outside the united states 
some of our commissions related to sales of the cyberknife system are payable in euros 
to the extent that management can predict the timing of payments under these contracts  we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate such risks in the future 
at june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million invested in other financial instruments 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances 
we believe that while the instruments we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  and except as described below  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
however  should interest rates increase  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell before scheduled maturity 
if overall interest rates had risen by basis points  the fair value of our net investment position at june  would have decreased by approximately  assuming consistent levels 
at june   we held approximately million of ars instruments whose underlying assets are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
in february  auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed 
at june   we determined the fair market values of these securities using a discounted cash flow methodology 
significant inputs that went into the model were estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and the probability of the auction succeeding or the security being called 
changes in the assumptions of our model based on dynamic market conditions could have a significant impact on the valuation of these securities  which may lead us in the future to take an impairment charge for these securities
