these agreements expire between and these long term liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension  postretirement and other compensation related plans  some of which are discounted in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments 
in the table  we have not included amounts related to future pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions  as such required funding amounts have not been determined

the variable portion of the rate at december  excluding the margin and facility fees was between and for substantially all of our variable rate debt

future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity under this revolving credit facility 
this table excludes million of unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
a potential significant future use of cash would be the payment to computer sciences corporation  or csc  if it were to exercise its option to sell its credit reporting business to us at any time prior to the option exercise price would be determined by agreement or by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within days after the exercise of the option 
we estimate that if the option had been exercised at december   the price range would have been approximately million to million 
this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business  current market conditions and other factors  all of which are subject to constant change 
therefore  the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than our estimate 
our agreement with csc  which expires on july   also provides us with an option to purchase its credit reporting business if it does not elect to renew the agreement or if there is a change in control of csc while the agreement is in effect 
if csc were to exercise its option  or if we were able to and decided to exercise our option  then we would have to obtain additional sources of funding 
we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the capital markets for debt and or equity financing 
however  the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors  including credit market conditions  the state of the equity markets  general economic conditions  our credit ratings and our financial performance and condition 
off balance sheet transactions other than facility leasing arrangements  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities

this million lease expires in lease payments for the remaining term totaled million at december  under this synthetic lease arrangement  we have guaranteed the residual value of the leased property to the lessor 
in the event that the property were to be sold by the lessor at the end of the lease term  we would be responsible for any shortfall of the sales proceeds  up to a maximum amount of million  which equals of the value of the property at the beginning of the lease term 
the liability for this shortfall  which was million and million at december  and  respectively  is recorded in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
letters of credit and guarantees we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit  performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business 
the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december   and all have a maturity of one year or less 
guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units 
in connection with the sale of our risk management collections business to rma holdings  llc  or rma  in october  we guaranteed the operating lease payments of a partnership affiliated with rma to a lender of the partnership pursuant to a term loan 
the operating lease  which expires december   has a remaining balance of million  based on the undiscounted value of remaining lease payments  including real estate taxes  at december  on september   rma sold substantially all of its assets to nco group  inc  or nco 
in conjunction with this sale  nco agreed to assume the operating lease obligations discussed above  which we will continue to guarantee 
we believe that the likelihood of demand for payment by us is minimal and expect no material losses to occur related to this guarantee 
accordingly  we do not have a liability on our consolidated balance sheets at december  or related to this guarantee 
other contingencies there are other matters which we are involved in  such as legal proceedings  claims and litigation  for which the final outcome and impact to our consolidated financial statements is uncertain at december  pension plans at december   our us retirement income plan  or usrip  and the equifax inc pension plan  or eipp  met or exceeded erisa s minimum funding requirements 
we do not expect to have to make any minimum funding contributions under erisa for with respect to the usrip or the eipp  based on applicable law 
in january and  we made discretionary contributions of million and million  respectively  to the eipp 
we also made a million discretionary contribution in to fund certain other post retirement benefit plans 
in the future  we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions  depending on certain circumstances  including market conditions and liquidity needs 
for our non us  tax qualified retirement plans  we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations 
for the non qualified supplementary retirement plans  we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants  but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 
related party transactions we engage in various transactions and arrangements with related parties 
we believe the terms of the transactions and arrangements do not differ from those that would have been negotiated with an independent party 
seasonality we experience seasonalities in certain of our revenue streams 
revenue generated from the work number and tax and talent management business units within the talx operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year 
revenue from our ocis and mortgage reporting solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions  most commonly the second and third calendar quarters 
inflation we do not believe that the rate of inflation has had a material effect on our operating results 
however  inflation could adversely affect our future operating results 
recent accounting pronouncements for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results 
for additional information about these policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the time 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured  the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed 
if at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
if there is uncertainty as to the customer s acceptance of our deliverables  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
if at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we have certain information solution offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements 
to account for each of these elements separately  the delivered elements must have stand alone value to our customer  and there must exist objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for any undelivered elements 
judgments and uncertainties each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables 
these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value  concluding when the element will be delivered  and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services 
in addition  the determination of certain of our marketing information services revenue requires the use of estimates  principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears 
in these instances  we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past 
differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 
effects if actual results differ from assumptions for certain contracts containing multiple elements  the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their relative fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method 
if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate elements for accounting or fair value is not known for any undelivered elements  arrangement consideration may only be recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer 
we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past 
we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates  revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future  we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
judgments and uncertainties in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment  we use projections of future discounted cash flows from our reporting units to determine whether the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value 
these projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates  anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values 
our estimates of fair value for each reporting unit are corroborated by market multiple comparables 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our projected discounted cash flows could result in different values and could result in a goodwill impairment charge 
additionally  a change in our reporting unit structure would result in the requirement to test goodwill for impairment at different reporting units 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
additionally  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
indefinite lived intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets consist of contractual territorial rights representing the estimated fair value of rights to operate in certain territories acquired through the purchase of independent credit reporting agencies in the us and canada 
our contractual territorial rights are perpetual in nature and  therefore  the useful lives are considered indefinite 
in accordance with sfas  we are required to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances change that would indicate the asset might be impaired 
judgments and uncertainties we perform the impairment test for our indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing the asset s fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of our contractual territorial rights based on projected discounted future cash flows 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our contractual territorial rights  or using a methodology other than a discounted cash flow model  could result in different values for our contractual territorial rights and could result in an impairment charge 
the most significant assumptions within our discounted cash flow model are the discount rate  growth rate and charge for contributory assets 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
additionally  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
loss contingencies we are subject to various proceedings  lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we determine whether to disclose and or accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable  reasonably possible or remote 
judgments and uncertainties we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability in our consolidated balance sheet for the estimated settlement costs 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible  but not probable  we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency 
our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies 
however  if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates  we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid 
we periodically assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 
our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities 
we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are probable of being sustained under such examinations 
regularly  we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 
judgments and uncertainties we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income  mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions  and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material 
pension and other postretirement plans our pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  for the years ended december  and we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  which include discount rates  salary growth  expected return on plan assets  interest cost and mortality rates 
judgments and uncertainties we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is primarily based on the expected equity returns based on assumptions such as dividend yield and growth rate  and estimated risk premium for various asset categories 
these assumptions are projected using an asset liability forecasting model  which produces a range and distribution of values for the assumed rate of return 
we determine our discount rates primarily based on high quality  fixed income investments and yield to maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material 
adjusting our expected long term rate of return at december  by would have changed our estimated pension expense in by approximately million 
adjusting our weighted average discount rate at december  by would have changed our estimated pension expense in by approximately million 
stock based compensation we have stock based compensation plans which provide that qualified and non qualified stock options and nonvested stock may be granted to officers and other employees 
in accordance with sfas r we recognize the cost of share based payment transactions over the requisite service period 
that cost is measured based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
we use the binomial model to calculate the fair value of stock options granted on or after january  the fair value of options granted prior to was determined using the black scholes model 
nonvested stock is valued based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant  reduced for expected dividends during the requisite service period 
we reassess all assumptions used in calculating fair value each grant date 
judgments and uncertainties the fair value of our stock options is calculated using the binomial model which incorporates assumptions regarding anticipated employee exercise behavior  expected stock price volatility  dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
the fair value of nonvested stock is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
however  since our nonvested stock does not pay dividends during the vesting period  the fair value on the date of grant is reduced by the present value of the expected dividends over the requisite service period 
sfas r requires us to estimate forfeitures at the grant date 
accordingly  compensation cost is recognized based on the number of awards expected to vest 
there may be adjustments in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation that could be material 
a change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   would have reduced our net income by approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of our business  we are exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  that could impact our results of operations and financial position 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities  and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to hedge certain of these exposures 
we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do transact business in other currencies  primarily the british pound  the euro  the canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
for most of these foreign currencies  we are a net recipient  and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
we are required to translate  or express in us dollars  the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable year end rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year 
we record the resulting translation adjustment  and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a long term investment nature within other comprehensive income  as a component of our shareholders equity 
other immaterial foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
we do not  as a matter of policy  hedge translational foreign currency exposure 
we may  however  hedge transactional foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 
at december   a weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during would have increased our revenue by million and our pre tax operating profit by million 
at december   a weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during would have increased our revenue by million and our pre tax operating profit by million 
a stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pre tax operating profit for and interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variable rate  long term senior credit facility and commercial paper borrowings 
we attempt to achieve the lowest all in weighted average cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt  and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt 
at december   our weighted average cost of debt was and weighted average life of debt was years 
at december   of our debt was fixed rate  and the remaining was variable rate 
occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps 
a change in the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt would not have materially impacted our net income 
based on and the amount of outstanding variable rate debt  we have material exposure to interest rate risk 
in the future  if our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing variable rate credit facilities or new variable rate debt instruments  we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt  as well as the proportionate amount of fixed rate and variable rate debt  can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors
