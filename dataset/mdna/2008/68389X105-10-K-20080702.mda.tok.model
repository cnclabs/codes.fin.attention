item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations supplemental disclosure related to certain charges and gains for additional information about charges to earnings associated with our recent acquisitions 
we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with combining the operations of our acquired companies  which may be substantial 
additional costs may include costs of employee redeployment  relocation and retention  including salary increases or bonuses  accelerated stock based compensation expenses and severance payments  reorganization or closure of facilities  taxes  and termination of contracts that provide redundant or conflicting services 
some of these costs may have to be accounted for as expenses that would decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those adjustments are made 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
revised  business combinations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of statement r 
statement r is effective for us beginning in fiscal we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of statement r on our consolidated financial statements 
we currently believe that the adoption of statement r will result in the recognition of certain types of expenses in our results of operations that we currently capitalize pursuant to existing accounting standards and may also impact our financial statements in other ways 
we may be unable to hire enough qualified employees or we may lose key employees 
we rely on the continued service of our senior management  including our chief executive officer  members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees 
in the software industry  there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business  product development  technical and other personnel 
in addition  acquisitions could cause us to lose key personnel of the acquired companies or at oracle 
we may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices 
we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel 
with rare exceptions  we do not have long term employment or non competition agreements with our employees 
members of our senior management team have left oracle over the years for a variety of reasons  and we cannot assure you that there will not be additional departures  which may be disruptive to our operations 
we continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs 
when we make adjustments to our workforce  we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure 
we may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention efforts and or increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program 

table of contents part of our total compensation program includes stock options 
stock options are an important tool in attracting and retaining employees in our industry 
if our stock price performs poorly  it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees 
in addition  because we expense all stock based compensation  we may in the future change our stock based and other compensation practices 
some of the changes we consider from time to time include the reduction in the number of employees granted options  a reduction in the number of options granted per employee and a change to alternative forms of stock based compensation 
any changes in our compensation practices or changes made by competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel 
our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues  and have significant operations  outside of the united states 
our international operations include software development  sales  customer support  consulting  on demand and shared administrative service centers 
we are subject to a variety of risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries  including those related to general economic conditions in each country or region  regulatory changes  political unrest  terrorism and the potential for other hostilities  public health risks  particularly in areas in which we have significant operations  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  overlapping tax regimes  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
in addition  compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions 
these laws and regulations include data privacy requirements  labor relations laws  tax laws  anti competition regulations  import and trade restrictions  export requirements  us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act  and local laws which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials 
violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines  criminal sanctions against us  our officers or our employees  and prohibitions on the conduct of our business 
any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries  could delay or prevent potential acquisitions  and could also materially damage our reputation  our brand  our international expansion efforts  our ability to attract and retain employees  our business and our operating results 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties 
as the majority shareholder of i flex solutions limited  a publicly traded indian software company focused on the banking industry  we are faced with several additional risks  including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control or obtain financial and other information on a timely basis 
we may experience foreign currency gains and losses 
we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than the us dollar 
our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens 
our revenues and operating results have recently been favorably affected by the weakening us dollar relative to other major foreign currencies 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies  particularly the euro  japanese yen and british pound relative to the us dollar can significantly affect revenues and our operating results 
our foreign currency transaction gains and losses  primarily related to sublicense fees and other agreements among us and our subsidiaries and distributors  are charged against earnings in the period incurred 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain transaction and translation exposures in major currencies  but we will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances where it is not possible or cost effective to hedge foreign currencies 

table of contents our periodic workforce restructurings can be disruptive 
we have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce  including our direct sales force on which we continue to rely heavily  in response to management changes  product changes  performance issues  acquisitions and other internal and external considerations 
in the past  sales force and other restructurings have generally resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity 
these effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues could be negatively affected 
oracle on demand and crm on demand may not be successful 
we offer oracle on demand outsourcing services for our applications and database technology  delivered either at our data center facilities  at select partner data centers or at customer facilities 
we also offer crm on demand  which is a subscription service offering that provides our customers with our crm software functionality delivered via a hosted  web based solution that we manage 
these business models continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively  generate significant revenues or develop them into profitable businesses 
we incur expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our oracle on demand and crm on demand businesses in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings 
these businesses are subject to a variety of risks including demand for these services may not meet our expectations  we may not be able to operate these businesses at an acceptable profit level  we manage critical customer applications  data and other confidential information through oracle on demand and crm on demand  accordingly  we face increased exposure to significant damage claims and risk to future business prospects in the event of system failures  inadequate disaster recovery or loss or misappropriation of customer confidential information  we may face regulatory exposure in certain areas such as data privacy  data security and export compliance  as well as workforce reduction claims as a result of customers transferring their it functions to us  the laws and regulations applicable to hosted service providers are unsettled  particularly in the areas of privacy and security and use of global resources  changes in these laws could affect our ability to provide services from or to some locations and could increase both the costs and risks associated with providing the services  demand for these services may be affected by customer and media concerns about security risks  international transfers of data  government or other third party access to data  and or use of outsourced services providers more generally  and our offerings may require large fixed costs such as for data centers  computers  network infrastructure and security and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to offset these costs and generate acceptable operating margins from these offerings 
we might experience significant errors or security flaws in our products and services 
despite testing prior to their release  software products frequently contain errors or security flaws  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
the detection and correction of any security flaws can be time consuming and costly 
errors in our software products could affect the ability of our products to work with other hardware or software products  could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
if we experience errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products  we could lose revenues 
in addition  we run our own business operations  oracle on demand  crm on demand and other outsourcing services  support and consulting services  on our products and networks and any security flaws  if exploited  could affect our ability to conduct internal business operations 
end users  who rely on our products and services for applications that are critical to their businesses  may have a greater sensitivity to product errors and security vulnerabilities than customers for software products generally 
software product errors and security flaws in our products or services could expose us to product liability  performance and or warranty claims as well as harm our reputation  which could impact our future sales of products and services 
in addition  we may be legally required to publicly report security breaches of our services  which could adversely impact future business prospects for those services 
we may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years  if at all 
developing and localizing software is expensive and the investment in product development often involves 
table of contents a long return on investment cycle 
we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities 
accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases 
we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 
however  we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years if at all 
our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination  audits  investigations  sanctions and penalties 
we derive revenues from contracts with the united states government  state and local governments and their respective agencies  which may terminate most of these contracts at any time  without cause 
there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies  both domestically and internationally  to reduce spending 
our federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the united states congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts 
similarly  our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations 
additionally  government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  refund of a portion of fees received  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 
business disruptions could affect our operating results 
a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas 
we are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services  including some of our on demand offerings 
a major earthquake  fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
there are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness 
as of may   we had an aggregate of billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between and  and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations  generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 
we may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures 
there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt 
furthermore  if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase 
in addition  changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities 
these risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
adverse litigation results could affect our business 
we are subject to various legal proceedings 
litigation can be lengthy  expensive and disruptive to our operations  and results cannot be predicted with certainty 
an adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to income taxes as well as non income based taxes  in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
our intercompany transfer pricing is currently being reviewed by the irs and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future 
we previously negotiated three unilateral advance pricing agreements with the irs 
table of contents that cover many of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the irs from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements 
these agreements are effective for fiscal years through may  we have submitted to the irs a request for renewal of this advance pricing agreement for the years ending may  through may  however  these agreements do not cover all elements of our transfer pricing and do not bind tax authorities outside the united states 
we have finalized one bilateral advance pricing agreement  which was effective for the years ending may  through may  and we have submitted a renewal for the years ending may  through may  we currently are negotiating an additional bilateral agreement to cover the period from june  through may  there can be no guarantee that such negotiations will result in an agreement 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we are also subject to non income based taxes  such as payroll  sales  use  value added  net worth  property and goods and services taxes  in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non income based tax liabilities 
our acquisition activities have increased our non income based tax exposures 
peoplesoft s customer assurance program may expose us to substantial liabilities if triggered 
in june  in response to our tender offer  peoplesoft implemented what it referred to as the customer assurance program or cap 
the cap incorporated a provision in peoplesoft s standard licensing arrangement that purports to contractually burden us  as a result of our acquisition of peoplesoft  with a contingent obligation to make payments to peoplesoft customers should we fail to take certain business actions for a fixed period of time after this acquisition 
the payment obligation  which typically expires four years from the date of the contract  is fixed at an amount generally between two and five times the license and first year support fees paid to peoplesoft in the applicable license transaction 
we concluded that  as of the date of the peoplesoft acquisition  the penalty provisions under the cap represented a contingent liability of ours 
the aggregate potential cap obligation as of may  was billion 
some of the cap provisions have expired or have been removed from these license arrangements 
we expect the significant majority of the remaining cap provisions to expire by the end of calendar while we have taken extensive steps to assure customers that we intend to continue developing and supporting the peoplesoft and jd edwards product lines and  as of may   we have not received any claims for cap payments  peoplesoft customers may assert claims for cap payments 
our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value 
all of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price 
the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products  product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us  and any announcements by us of acquisitions  major transactions  or management changes could also affect our stock price 
our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts  changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock  our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance 
a significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business

over the last four fiscal years  we have invested billions of dollars  including billion in fiscal  for our acquisitions of a number of companies including peoplesoft  bea  siebel and hyperion

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends 
this overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
we then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition 
we are the world s largest enterprise software company 
we are organized into two businesses  software and services  which are further divided into five operating segments 
each of these operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges 
although we report our actual results in us dollars  we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than us dollars 
therefore  we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
an overview of our five operating segments follows 

table of contents software business our software business is comprised of two operating segments new software license revenues and software license updates and product support revenues 
we expect that our software business revenues will continue to increase due to continued demand for our products and due to our acquisitions  which should allow us to improve margins and profits and continue to make investments in research and development 
new software licenses we license our database and middleware as well as our applications software to businesses of many sizes  government agencies  educational institutions and resellers 
the growth in new software license revenues is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions  governmental budgetary constraints  the competitive position of our software products and acquisitions 
our new software license business is also characterized by long sales cycles 
the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues 
since our new software license revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions  we believe that analysis of new software license revenues on a trailing quarter period as provided in our quarterly reports on form q provides additional visibility into the underlying performance of our new software license business 
new software license revenues represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
our new software license margins have been and will continue to be affected by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies we have acquired 
competition in the software business is intense 
our goal is to maintain a first or second position in each of our software product categories and certain industry segments as well as to grow our software revenues faster than our competitors 
we believe that the features and functionality of our software products are as strong as they have ever been 
we have focused on lowering the total cost of ownership of our software products by improving integration  decreasing installation times  lowering administration costs and improving the ease of use 
in addition  our broad portfolio of product offerings many of which have been acquired over the past four fiscal years helps us to offer customers the ability to gain efficiencies by consolidating their it software stack with a single vendor  which reduces the number of disparate software vendors with which customers interact 
reducing the total cost of ownership of our products provides our customers with a higher return on their it investments  which we believe creates more demand for our products and services and provides us with a competitive advantage 
we have also continued to focus on improving the overall quality of our software products and service levels 
we believe this will lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty and help us achieve our goal of becoming our customers leading technology advisor 
software license updates and product support customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period  as well as technical support assistance 
in addition  we offer oracle unbreakable linux support  which provides enterprise level support for the linux operating system and  in fiscal  we introduced support for oracle vm server virtualization software 
substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually 
the growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors the renewal rate of the support contract base  the amount of new support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses  and the support contract base assumed from companies we have acquired 
software license updates and product support revenues  which represented of our total revenues in fiscal  and  is our highest margin business unit 
support margins during fiscal were  and accounted for of our total margins over the same period 
we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will continue to grow for the following reasons substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their support contracts when eligible for renewal 
substantially all of our customers purchase license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses  resulting in a further increase in our support contract base 
even if new software license revenue growth was flat  software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow assuming renewal and cancellation rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transactions add to our support contract base 

table of contents our acquisitions have increased our support contract base  as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed 
we record adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in business acquisitions to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates 
as a result  as required by business combination accounting rules  we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amount of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
to the extent underlying support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition  we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods  the majority of which are one year 
services business our services business consists of consulting  on demand and education 
our services business  which represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  has significantly lower margins than our software business 
consulting consulting revenues have increased primarily due to an increase in application implementations resulting from higher sales of new software applications over the past year and our recent acquisitions 
we expect consulting revenues to continue to grow as consulting revenues tend to lag software revenues by several quarters since consulting services  if purchased  are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses and our new software license growth rates have generally increased over the last several quarters in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods 
on demand on demand includes oracle on demand  crm on demand  as well as advanced customer services offerings 
we believe that our on demand offerings provide our customers flexibility in how they manage their it environments and an additional opportunity to lower their total cost of ownership and can therefore provide us with a competitive advantage 
we have made and plan to continue to make investments in our on demand business to support current and future revenue growth  which has negatively impacted on demand margins and may continue to do so in the future 
education the purpose of our education services is to further the adoption and usage of our software products by our customers and to create opportunities to grow our software revenues 
education revenues have been impacted by personnel reductions in our customers information technology departments  tighter controls over discretionary spending and greater use of outsourcing solutions 
however  education revenues and expenses have increased in recent periods in comparison to the corresponding periods of the prior year as a result of additional education offerings related to our acquired products 
acquisitions an active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy 
over the last four fiscal years  we have invested billions of dollars  including billion in fiscal  to acquire a number of complementary companies  products  services and technologies such as bea systems  inc in fiscal  hyperion solutions corporation in fiscal  siebel systems  inc in fiscal and peoplesoft  inc in fiscal we believe our acquisition program supports our long term strategic direction  strengthens our competitive position  expands our customer base  provides greater scale to accelerate innovation  grows our revenues and earnings  and increases stockholder value 
we expect to continue to acquire companies  products  services and technologies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our recent acquisitions 
we believe we can fund additional acquisitions with our internally available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash generated from operations  amounts available under our existing debt capacity  additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities 
we estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings  operating margin  cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition business combinations goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments accounting for income taxes legal and other contingencies stock based compensation allowances for doubtful accounts in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the finance and audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from the following sources software  which includes new software license and software license updates and product support revenues  and services  which include consulting  on demand and education revenues 
new software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database  middleware and applications software  and exclude revenues derived from software license updates  which are included in software license updates and product support 
while the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software  we recognize new software license revenue when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software  we deliver the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
substantially all of our new software license revenues are recognized in this manner 
the vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support  which are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically one year 
software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades  maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
product support includes internet access to technical content  as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers 
software license updates and product support are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees 
substantially all of our customers purchase both software license updates and product support when they acquire new software licenses 
in addition  substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually 

table of contents many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts 
consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in sop the more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services  revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
we estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenue is recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services 
the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the software license and consulting transactions  then new software license revenues are generally recognized together with the consulting services based on contract accounting using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method 
contract accounting is applied to any arrangements that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license fees  where services include significant modification or customization of the software  where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted  or where the software license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services 
on demand is comprised of oracle on demand  crm on demand and advanced customer services 
oracle on demand provides multi featured software and hardware management and maintenance services for our database  middleware and applications software delivered either at our data center facilities  at select partner data centers or at customer facilities 
crm on demand is a service offering that provides our customers with our siebel crm software functionality delivered via a hosted solution that we manage 
advanced customer services are earned by providing customers configuration and performance analysis  personalized support and annual on site technical services 
revenue from on demand services is recognized over the term of the service period  which is generally one year 
education revenues include instructor led  media based and internet based training in the use of our products 
education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined by vendor specific objective evidence 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately  and for software license updates and product support services is also measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for these undelivered elements 
as a result  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results 
we defer revenues for any undelivered elements  and recognize revenues when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for each such element 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements  we defer revenues until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  we use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered 
table of contents elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions 
however  if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy  for example in agreements with government entities when acceptance periods are required by law  or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short term in nature  we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example  acceptance provisions that are long term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions  when such provisions are required by law  to determine the probability of possible cancellation 
we consider multiple factors  including the history with the customer in similar transactions  the essential use of the software licenses and the planning  budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity 
if we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote  we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met 
if such a determination cannot be made  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
our standard payment terms are net days 
however  payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements  and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition 
while most of our arrangements include short term payment terms  we have a standard practice of providing long term financing to credit worthy customers through our financing division 
since fiscal  when our financing division was formed  we have established a history of collection  without concessions  on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date 
provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize new software license revenues for these arrangements upon delivery  net of any payment discounts from financing transactions 
we have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non recourse basis to third party financing institutions 
we account for the sale of these receivables as true sales as defined in fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
our customers include several of our suppliers and on rare occasion  we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have licensed our software to these same companies concurrent transaction 
software license agreements that occur within a three month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure 
when we acquire goods or services from a customer  we negotiate the purchase separately from any software license transaction  at terms we consider to be at arm s length  and settle the purchase in cash 
we recognize new software license revenues from concurrent transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations 
business combinations in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  support obligations assumed  estimated restructuring liabilities and pre acquisition contingencies 

table of contents although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the software products acquired 
the sum of these costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation 
we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
we also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
as a result  we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of million  million and million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal  and  respectively 
historically  substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal 
to the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed  we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods  the substantial majority of which are one year 
had we included costs for our estimated selling and research and development activities and the associated margin for unspecified product upgrades and enhancements to be provided under our assumed support arrangements  the fair values of the support obligations would have been significantly higher than what we had recorded and we would have recorded a higher amount of software license updates and product support revenues both historically and in future periods related to these assumed support arrangements 
other significant estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations include restructuring costs 
restructuring costs are typically comprised of severance costs  costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs 
restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by management  but are generally subject to refinement during the purchase price allocation period generally within one year of the acquisition date 
to estimate restructuring expenses  management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities 
estimated restructuring expenses may change as management executes the approved plan 
decreases to the cost estimates of executing the currently approved plans associated with pre merger activities of the companies we acquire are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill indefinitely  whereas increases to the estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period and as operating expenses thereafter 
for a given acquisition  we may identify certain pre acquisition contingencies 
if  during the purchase price allocation period  we are able to determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency  we will include that amount in the purchase price allocation 
if  as of the end of the purchase price allocation period  we are unable to 
table of contents determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency  we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated 
with the exception of unresolved income tax matters  after the end of the purchase price allocation period  any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre acquisition contingency will be included in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined 
in fiscal  we will adopt fasb statement no 
revised  business combinations 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of statement require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis  which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  did not result in an impairment charge 
we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment may exist 
each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal  or accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment  and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our 
table of contents historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
remittances of foreign earnings to the us are planned based on projected cash flow  working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations 
based on these assumptions  we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the us and provide us federal taxes on these amounts 
material changes in our estimates could impact our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we consider future growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known  which can materially impact our effective tax rate 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
as part of our accounting for business combinations  some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the quarter any impairment is recorded 
amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure  however  deferred taxes have been recorded for non deductible amortization expenses as a part of the purchase price allocation process 
we have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions  including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates  in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities 
income tax contingencies existing as of the acquisition dates of the acquired companies are evaluated quarterly and any adjustments are recorded as adjustments to goodwill 
on june   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties 

table of contents legal and other contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
as a result of our acquisition of peoplesoft in fiscal  we inherited contingent liabilities resulting from a program peoplesoft had implemented prior to the consummation of our acquisition of peoplesoft referred to as the customer assurance program or cap 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
stock based compensation we account for share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which requires that share based payments to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
in addition  we have applied the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
in our accounting for statement r 
we are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience  actual forfeitures in the future may differ 
in addition  to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates  we record a true up for the difference in the period that the awards vest  and such true ups could materially affect our operating results 
as required by statement r  we recognize stock based compensation expense for share based payments issued or assumed after june  that are expected to vest 
for all share based payments granted or assumed beginning june   we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period of the award  which is generally four years 
the fair value of the unvested portion of share based payments granted prior to june  is recognized over the remaining service period using the accelerated expense attribution method  net of estimated forfeitures 
in determining whether an award is expected to vest  we use an estimated  forward looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rates 
stock based compensation expense recorded using an estimated forfeiture rate is updated for actual forfeitures quarterly 
we also consider  each quarter  whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our forfeiture rate 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options 
the risk free interest rate assumption we use is based upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards 
we use the implied volatility of our publicly traded  longest term options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options  we have used historical rates of employee groups by job classification 
our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
the aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock based compensation expense we record to vary 
we record deferred tax assets for stock based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns  based on the amount of stock based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will 
table of contents receive a tax deduction 
because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction  the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair value of our stock awards also indirectly affect our income tax expense 
in addition  differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid in capital 
if the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset  such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits 
if the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero  then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense 
our pool of excess tax benefits is computed in accordance with the alternative transition method as prescribed under fasb staff position fas r  transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs or refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods 
allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable  the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowances for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our future results of operations could be materially affected 
results of operations the comparability of our operating results in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily impacted by our acquisition of hyperion in our fourth quarter of fiscal  our acquisition of agile software  inc in our first quarter of fiscal and our acquisition of bea in our fourth quarter of fiscal the comparability of our operating results in fiscal in comparison to fiscal is impacted by our acquisition of siebel in our third quarter of fiscal  the consolidation of i flex solutions limited at the beginning of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  our acquisition of hyperion in our fourth quarter of fiscal in our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal compared to fiscal  we quantify the contribution of our acquired products to the growth in new software license revenues  the amount of revenues associated with software license updates and product support  as well as on demand services in the fiscal to fiscal comparison  and present supplemental disclosure related to certain charges and gains including acquisition accounting and stock based compensation  where applicable 
although certain revenue contributions from our acquisitions are quantifiable  we are unable to identify the following the contribution of the significant majority of consulting and education services revenues from acquired companies in fiscal  and with the exception of the impact of bea consulting and education revenues in fiscal in comparison to fiscal  and i flex and hyperion consulting revenues and hyperion education revenues for which we disclose the impact in fiscal in comparison to fiscal as the significant majority of these services have been fully integrated into our existing operations 
the contribution of expenses associated with acquired products and services in fiscal  and with the exception of the impact of certain bea operating expenses in fiscal in comparison to fiscal and the impact of certain i flex and hyperion operating expenses for which we disclose the impact in fiscal in comparison to fiscal as the significant majority of these services have been fully integrated into our existing operations 

table of contents we caution readers that  while pre and post acquisition comparisons as well as the quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends  the information has inherent limitations for the following reasons the quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to our sales force integration efforts  in particular the effect of having a single sales force offer similar products 
we believe that if our sales forces had not been integrated  the relative mix of products sold would have been different 
our acquisitions in the periods presented did not result in our entry into a new line of business or product category 
therefore  we provided multiple products with substantially similar features and functionality 
although substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal  amounts shown as support deferred revenue in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges and gains see below are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customers do not renew 
constant currency presentation we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this annual report using constant currency disclosure 
we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
to present this information  current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than us dollars are converted into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect on may   which was the last day of our prior fiscal year  rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods 
for example  if an entity reporting in euros had revenues of million euros from products sold on may  and may   our financial statements would reflect revenues of million in fiscal using as the exchange rate and million in fiscal using as the exchange rate 
the constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal results using the fiscal exchange rate and indicate  in this example  no change in revenues during the period

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues increased in fiscal due to increased demand for our products and services offerings and incremental revenues from our acquisitions 
the growth in our total revenues was positively affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of percentage points in fiscal due to the weakening of the us dollar relative to other major international currencies 
excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  new software license revenues contributed to the growth in total revenues  software license updates and product support revenues contributed and services revenues contributed 
excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the americas contributed to the increase in total revenues  emea contributed and asia pacific contributed 
total operating expenses were adversely affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of percentage points 
excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher salary and employee benefits associated with increased headcount levels primarily resulting from our fiscal acquisitions  agile in the first quarter of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  bea in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as higher commissions and bonuses associated with increased revenues  earnings and headcount levels 
in addition  operating expenses also increased in fiscal due to higher expenses from the amortization of intangible assets and additional stock based compensation resulting from a higher fair value of grants issued in fiscal caused primarily by our higher stock price and the acceleration of vesting of certain acquired stock awards upon employee terminations pursuant to the original terms of those awards 
total operating expenses in fiscal were also reduced by a million benefit as a result of a settlement of an acquired legal contingency from peoplesoft for less than the amount accrued as of the end of the purchase price allocation period 
the increases in operating expenses during fiscal were partially offset by a million gain on property sale and a million reduction of in process research and development from our fiscal acquisitions in comparison to our fiscal acquisitions 
total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased during fiscal the growth in our operating margin in fiscal was the result of our revenue growth  both organic and from acquisitions  and the relatively fixed nature of our cost structure in the short term 
in addition  our operating margin growth was favorably affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of percentage points 
international operations will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses 
as a result  total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the relative strength of the us dollar against certain major international currencies

excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the americas contributed to the increase in total revenues  emea contributed and asia pacific contributed 
operating expenses were adversely affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of percentage points 
excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the increase in total operating expenses was primarily due to higher salary and employee benefits associated with increased headcount levels primarily resulting from our acquisitions  as well as higher commissions and travel and entertainment expenses associated with both increased revenues and headcount levels 
in addition  operating expenses also increased in fiscal due to higher amortization costs of intangible assets and stock based compensation expenses related to our adoption of statement r at the beginning of fiscal the aforementioned increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower restructuring expenses and the settlement of a peoplesoft contingency that provided a million benefit to our operating expenses see acquisition related and other expenses discussion below 
operating margins as a percentage of total revenues were flat in fiscal in comparison to fiscal and were favorably affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of percentage points 
our revenues grew at a faster rate than our operating expenses  excluding the impact of amortization costs of intangible assets and stock based compensation expenses 
the increases in those cost categories offset the slower growth in our other operating expenses 

table of contents supplemental disclosure related to certain charges and gains to supplement our consolidated financial information we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future

we were in compliance with the credit agreements covenants as of may  selected quarterly financial data quarterly revenues and expenses have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors  including sales compensation plans 
in addition  our european operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in europe during the summer 
these seasonal factors are common in the software industry 
these factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter  which historically has been our highest revenue quarter 
we expect this trend to continue into the first quarter of fiscal the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters 
we believe that all necessary adjustments  which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated 
table of contents financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding 
fiscal quarter ended unaudited in millions  except per share amounts august november february may revenues gross profit operating income net income earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted fiscal quarter ended unaudited in millions  except per share amounts august november february may revenues gross profit operating income net income earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted stock options our stock option program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders 
we recognize that options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options granted while providing competitive compensation packages 
consistent with these dual goals  our cumulative potential dilution since june  has been a weighted average annualized rate of per year 
the potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new options granted and assumed  net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company  divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period 
this maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are exercised 
some of these options  which have year exercise periods  have exercise prices substantially higher than the current market price of our common stock 
at may   of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price 
consistent with our historical practices  we do not expect that dilution from future grants before the effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed per year for our ongoing business 
over the last years  our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option program  however  we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions  to repay indebtedness or for other purposes 
at may   the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised option awards  regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price  was the compensation committee of the board of directors reviews and approves the organization wide stock option grants to selected employees  all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual stock option grants in excess of  shares

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we generally purchase debt security investments with relatively short maturities see a description of our debt securities held in the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations presented above 
therefore  interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our debt security investments 
changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our investments 
for fiscal  total interest income was million with investments yielding an average on a worldwide basis 
this interest rate level was down by basis points from for fiscal if overall interest rates fell by basis points from our average of during fiscal  our annual interest income would decline by approximately million  assuming consistent investment levels

foreign currency transaction risk we transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
these foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions 
our forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses resulting from fair value changes included in non operating income  net the effective portion of our yen equity hedge described below is included in stockholders equity 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature

we measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedges by using the changes in spot exchange rates because this method reflects our risk management strategies  the economics of those strategies in our financial statements and better manages interest rate differentials between different countries 
under this method  the change in fair value of the forward contract attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates the effective portion is reported in stockholders equity to offset the translation results on the net investments
