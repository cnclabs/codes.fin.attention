item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our primary business activity involves the development  manufacture  marketing  sale and servicing of test handling and burn in related equipment and thermal sub systems for the global semiconductor industry 
this business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and test subcontractors  which in turn are dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors that are subject to significant cyclical trends in demand 
we expect that the semiconductor equipment industry will continue to be cyclical and volatile as consumer electronics  rather than personal computers  are now the principal end market for integrated circuits 
demand for consumer electronic products is unpredictable and product life cycles are becoming shorter 
integrated circuit manufacturers are unwilling to absorb the carrying costs of excess capacity  and as a result  delay placing large orders with equipment suppliers until business conditions improve 
changes in the semiconductor  electronics  computer and telecommunications industries  as well as rapidly shifting global economic conditions  have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our primary business 
after several years of order growth  orders for our test handling and burn in related equipment began to decline in the second half of and this softness carried into conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry were generally weak in and  although we have seen some improvement in forecasts from certain customers  we do not expect any significant improvement in business conditions over the near term 
as a result of the volatility within the industry the composition of orders and revenues of our primary business changed dramatically in as semiconductor test handler and burn in equipment orders declined significantly and orders for thermal sub systems increased 
this shift in product mix and other factors described herein led to a decline in our gross margin during to address this decline we will continue to focus on reducing product costs and overall spending  while we develop new product offerings for the test handler and burn in markets 
our deferred revenue totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in deferred revenue is the result of the recognition of revenue for certain semiconductor equipment product sales  including thermal sub systems used in burn in for which customer acceptance was obtained during the deferred revenue amounts recognized were partially offset by additional deferrals of semiconductor equipment product sales 
our operating results in the last three years have been impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory issues 
these charges totaled approximately million during the three year period ended december  approximately million in and were primarily the result of decreases in customer forecasts  competitive conditions in the test handler industry and  to a lesser extent  changes in our sales product mix 
exposure related to inventories is common in the semiconductor equipment industry due to the narrow customer base  the custom nature of the products and inventory and the shortened product life cycles caused by rapid changes in semiconductor manufacturing technology 
increased competition  particularly in the last several years  has also negatively impacted our gross margins on certain products and we believe it is likely these conditions will exist for the foreseeable future 
our other operating costs consist of research and development r d and selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
the decrease in sg a expense in was primarily a result of lower costs in our semiconductor equipment business resulting from lower business volumes partially offset by additional costs incurred by our microwave communications business resulting from the march acquisition of avs  and increased legal costs 
our non semiconductor equipment businesses have comprised approximately of our consolidated revenues during the last three years 
during  our television camera and microwave communications businesses underperformed and generated losses from operations of million and million respectively 
during we implemented strategies which we believe will help improve the profitability of these businesses 
these initiatives include the introduction of new product and a strategic acquisition 
our financial condition is strong with significant cash and short term investments and no long term debt 
during the three year period ended december   total cash and investments increased from million at december  to million at december  
table of contents our management team uses several performance metrics to manage our various businesses 
these metrics  which tend to focus on near term forecasts due to the limited order backlog in our businesses  include i order bookings and backlog for the most recently completed quarter and the forecast for the next quarter  ii inventory levels and related excess exposures typically based on the next twelve month s forecast  iii gross margin and other operating expense trends  iv industry data and trends noted in various publicly available sources  and v competitive factors and information 
due to the short term nature of our order backlog that historically has represented about three months of business and the inherent volatility of the semiconductor equipment business  our past performance is frequently not indicative of future operating results or cash flows 
application of critical accounting estimates and policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience  forecasts and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  however actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates  that are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   that we believe are the most important to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment include revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenue on sales to customers  which impacts our results from operations  estimation of valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically product warranty  inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts  which impact gross margin or operating expenses  the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits  which impact our tax provision  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses if we are required to record impairments of assets or accelerate their depreciation  and the valuation and recognition of share based compensation  which impacts gross margin  research and development expense  and selling  general and administrative expense 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  however  these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
share based compensation on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  statement no 
r and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 sab no 
requiring the measurement and recognition of all share based compensation under the fair value method 
during fiscal  we began recognizing share based compensation  under statement no 
r  for all awards granted in fiscal and for the unvested portion of previous award grants based on each award s grant date fair value 
we implemented statement no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method our financial statements and related information presented pertaining to periods prior to our adoption of statement no 
r  have not been adjusted to reflect the fair value of share based compensation expense 
we estimate the fair value of each share based award on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model 
to facilitate our adoption of statement no 
r  we applied the provisions of sab no 
in developing our methodologies to estimate our black scholes model inputs for certain options granted in option valuation models  including black scholes  require the input of highly subjective assumptions  and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the grant date fair value of an award 
these assumptions include the risk free rate of interest  expected dividend yield  expected volatility  and the expected life of the award 
the risk free 
table of contents rate of interest is based on the us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term of the award 
expected dividends are based primarily on historical factors related to our common stock 
expected volatility is based on historic  weekly stock price observations of our common stock during the period immediately preceding the share based award grant that is equal in length to the award s expected term 
we believe that historical volatility is the best estimate of future volatility 
due to a limited amount of historical option exercise data related to options with a five year contractual term  we adopted sab no 
s simplified method for estimating the expected term of share based awards granted during the first six months of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal we granted options with a ten year contractual term and utilized historical option exercise data for estimating the expected life of those awards 
statement no 
r also requires that estimated forfeitures be included as a part of the grant date estimate 
we used historical data to estimate expected employee behaviors related to option exercises and forfeitures 
prior to our adoption of statement no 
r  we reduced pro forma share based compensation expense  presented in the notes to our financial statements  for actual forfeitures as they occurred 
at december   excluding a reduction for forfeitures  we had approximately million and million of pre tax unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock units which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years and years  respectively 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue upon shipment and title passage for established products ie  those that have previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements that provide for full payment tied to shipment 
revenue for products that have not previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements or from sales where customer payment dates are not determinable is recognized upon customer acceptance 
for arrangements containing multiple elements  the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred at estimated fair value until delivery of the deferred elements 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty we provide for the estimated costs of product warranties in the period sales are recognized 
our warranty obligation estimates are affected by historical product shipment levels  product performance and material and labor costs incurred in correcting product performance problems 
should product performance  material usage or labor repair costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory we record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product demand  market conditions and product selling prices 
if future product demand  market conditions or product selling prices are less than those projected by management or if continued modifications to products are required to meet specifications or other customer requirements  increases to inventory reserves may be required 
income taxes we estimate our liability for income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our i current tax exposure  ii temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes and iii unrecognized tax benefits 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
establishing  reducing or increasing a valuation allowance in an accounting period results in an increase or decrease in tax expense in the statement of operations 
we must make significant judgments to determine the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  unrecognized tax benefits and any valuation allowance to be recorded against net deferred tax assets 
our gross deferred tax asset balance as of december  was million  with a valuation allowance of million for state tax credit and loss carryforwards 
the deferred tax assets consist primarily of deductible temporary differences and tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
intangible assets at december   intangible assets other than goodwill were evaluated for impairment using undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets as required by fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  statement no 
 and we concluded 
table of contents there was no impairment loss 
we are required to assess goodwill impairment using the methodology prescribed by fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  statement no 

statement no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the required annual goodwill impairment test is performed as of october st of each year 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this annual test in fiscal  and contingencies we are subject to certain contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of our businesses 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  statement no 
we assess the likelihood that future events will confirm the existence of a loss or an impairment of an asset 
if a loss or asset impairment is probable  as defined in statement no 
and the amount of the loss or impairment is reasonably estimable  we accrue a charge to operations in the period such conditions become known 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  business combinations statement 
no 
r  which establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination  including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
this statement also establishes disclosure requirements to enable financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
statement no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
statement no 
r will become effective for our fiscal year beginning in we are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of statement no 
r could have on our consolidated financial statements  if any 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities statement no 

statement no 
expands the use of fair value measurement by permitting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
this statement is effective for us on december   the first day of our fiscal year 
we have not yet determined if we will elect to measure any items at fair value under statement no 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements statement no 
 which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
statement no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
this statement is effective for us on december   the first day of our fiscal year 
we are evaluating whether adoption of this statement will result in a change to our fair value measurements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab requires analysis of misstatements using both an income statement rollover approach and a balance sheet iron curtain approach in assessing materiality and provides for a one time cumulative effect transition adjustment 
sab was effective for our fiscal year the adoption of sab had no impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes the recognition threshold and measurement criteria for determining the tax benefit amounts to recognize in the financial statements 
fin requires that tax positions be assessed using a two step process 
a tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not threshold  and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized 
uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date 
liabilities recorded as a result of this analysis must generally be recorded separately from deferred income tax accounts  and are classified as current or long term based on the time until expected payment 
we adopted the provisions of fin on december   the first day of our fiscal year 
as a result of the adoption of fin  we recognized a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately  a decrease in deferred tax assets of approximately  and a corresponding increase in the december  balance of retained earnings of approximately 
table of contents in june  the fasb reached a consensus on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  eitf 
eitf indicates that the income statement presentation on either a gross basis or a net basis of the taxes within the scope of the issue is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
eitf is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of eitf did not change our policy of presenting taxes within the scope of eitf on a net basis and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table summarizes certain operating data from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales for the three year period 
net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative gain on sale of facilities income from operations in may   we sold our metal detection equipment business  frl 
subsequent to the sale  the operating results of frl are being presented as discontinued operations and the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods have been reclassified accordingly 
unless otherwise indicated  the discussion and amounts provided in the results of operations section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k relate to continuing operations only 
compared to net sales our net sales decreased to million in  compared to net sales of million in sales of semiconductor equipment in decreased from the comparable period and accounted for of consolidated net sales versus in the primary cause of the decrease in sales of semiconductor equipment was a result of a decline in orders for our test handling and burn in related equipment which began in the second half of and carried into conditions in the back end semiconductor equipment industry were generally weak in at delta  these underlying and challenging industry dynamics were intensified by a sharp decline in orders for our highest margin product  the summit handler 
the decline in semiconductor test handler and burn in equipment orders was partially offset by the success of our new thermal sub system that began shipping during  however  this thermal sub system has a much lower selling price and gross margin than our summit test handler 
sales of television cameras accounted for of net sales in and decreased when compared to the same period of the primary cause of this decrease in sales is a result of decreased demand for our traffic camera products in transportation related applications 
sales of microwave communications equipment accounted for of net sales in and decreased when compared to during we saw an increase in demand for our microwave communications products primarily as a result of the acquisition of avs in march and strong demand from government agencies  however  total sales recognized by this segment decreased in due to the recognition of approximately million in revenue associated with our contract with the uae that was accepted and paid in the third quarter of gross margin gross margin consists of net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of materials  assembly and test labor  and overhead from operations 
our gross margin can fluctuate due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the mix of products sold  product support costs  inventory reserve adjustments  and 
table of contents utilization of manufacturing capacity 
our gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in from in our lower gross margin in was the result of lower margins in our semiconductor equipment business due to a change in product mix from our thermal test handlers to thermal sub system products 
our thermal sub system products have significantly lower gross margins than our thermal test handlers 
based on current customer forecasts  we expect this trend to continue in the future and  as a result  our gross margin could continue to be impacted 
to address the decrease in gross margin we are focusing on reducing product costs and overall spending 
in addition to a shift in product mix  our gross margin has been impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory issues and higher warranty costs associated with certain test handlers 
we compute the majority of our excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one year inventory usage forecast 
during and  we recorded net charges to cost of sales of approximately million and million  respectively  for excess and obsolete inventory 
approximately million of the charge recorded during was a result of a decline in customer forecasts for a burn in system  acquired from unigen  which negatively impacted our forecasted inventory usage 
while we believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns are adequate to cover our known exposures at december   reductions in customer forecasts or continued modifications to products  as a result of our failure to meet specifications or other customer requirements  will result in additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our gross margin in future periods 
conversely  if our actual inventory usage is greater than our forecasted usage  our gross margin in future periods may be favorably impacted 
research and development expense r d expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  product design and development activities  costs of engineering materials and supplies  and professional consulting expenses 
r d expense as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  decreasing from million in to million in decreased r d expense in was primarily a result of decreased labor and material costs within our semiconductor equipment and television camera businesses of approximately million and million  respectively  offset by an additional million of r d related costs incurred by our microwave communications business resulting from the march acquisition of avs  and other costs associated with new product development within that segment 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense consists primarily of salaries and benefit costs of employees  commission expense for independent sales representatives  product promotion and costs of professional services 
sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  decreasing from million in to million in the decrease in sg a expense in was primarily a result of a million decline in costs incurred by our semiconductor equipment business resulting from lower business volume due to the weak business conditions that existed within the back end semiconductor equipment industry during  a million decrease in costs incurred by our television camera business due to lower sales in  and million in decreased administrative costs within our corporate organization 
these reductions were offset by an additional million of sg a related costs incurred by our microwave communications business resulting from the march acquisition of avs  and increased legal costs 
interest income interest income was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in interest income resulted from an increase in our average cash and cash equivalents and investment balances and higher interest rates 

table of contents income taxes the provision for income taxes expressed as a percentage of pre tax income was in and in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits  the effect of statement no 
r that does not allow deferred tax benefits to be recognized on compensation expense related to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans and an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is based upon the weight of all available evidence  including such factors as our recent earnings history and expected future taxable income 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the majority of these assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions or other factors not currently known or anticipated 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  statement no 
 net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance of approximately million and million was provided on deferred tax assets at december  and december   respectively  for state tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards that  in the opinion of management  are more likely than not to expire before we can use them 
we have derived significant tax benefits from research and development tax credits 
the federal research and development tax credit expired on december  and it is uncertain when or if this tax credit will be extended 
if the credit is not extended  our income tax expense and effective tax rate in future periods will be adversely impacted 
in october  the irs commenced a routine examination of our us income tax return for this examination is expected to be completed in we believe it is reasonably possible that a portion of our total unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next months upon the conclusion of the examination or the lapse of the applicable statute of limitations 
however  it is premature to assess the range or the nature of the reasonably possible changes to our unrecognized tax benefits 
other items in may   we sold the land and building previously used by our operations in littleton  massachusetts 
the property was sold for million in cash  less related costs  resulting in a net pretax gain of approximately million that was recognized in in may   we sold substantially all the assets of our metal detection equipment business  frl 
the disposition resulted in a loss of approximately million that was recorded in amounts incurred in related to the disposition were not significant 
as a result of the factors set forth above  our income from continuing operations was million in  compared to million in our net income was million in  compared to million in compared to net sales our net sales increased to million in  compared to net sales of million in sales of semiconductor equipment in increased from the comparable period and accounted for of consolidated net sales in versus in the primary reasons for the increase in sales of our semiconductor equipment business were increased sales of our high speed test handlers and a burn in system acquired in the unigen transaction 
semiconductor equipment was a lower percentage of consolidated sales in primarily as a result of the recognition of million in revenue from our contract with the uae for microwave communications equipment 
sales of television cameras and other equipment accounted for of net sales in and increased when compared to the same period in the primary reason for the increase in sales of our television camera business was increased demand for board level cameras from original equipment manufacturers and increased demand for closed circuit security cameras 
sales of microwave equipment accounted for of net sales in and increased when compared to the increase in sales of our microwave communications business was primarily attributable to the 
table of contents recognition of approximately million in revenue associated with our contract with the uae that was accepted and paid in and increased demand for our other products during gross margin our gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in from in the decrease was the result of lower margins in our semiconductor equipment and microwave communications businesses 
during  high speed test handlers accounted for a greater percentage of revenue than in fiscal our high speed test handlers have significantly lower gross margins than our advanced thermal test handlers 
additionally  during we recognized million in revenue for a burn in system  acquired from unigen  which generated a gross margin of approximately 
our consolidated gross margin was also negatively impacted when our microwave communications business recognized approximately million in revenue associated with its contract with the uae which generated a gross margin of approximately 
the remaining revenue of million and associated profit under this contract will be recognized upon completion of the two year warranty period and release from our obligation under a standby letter of credit 
additionally  during  we recorded approximately million in share based compensation expense as a result of our adoption of statement no 
r 
our gross margin has been impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory issues and in higher warranty costs associated with certain test handlers 
we compute the majority of our excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one year inventory usage forecast 
during and  we recorded net charges to cost of sales of approximately million and million  respectively  for excess and obsolete inventory 
approximately million of the charge recorded during was the result of a decline in customer forecasts for a burn in system  acquired from unigen 
research and development expense r d expense as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal higher r d expense in was primarily a result of increased engineering headcount and overhead costs as a result of our unigen acquisition and labor and material costs for new product development within our semiconductor equipment business 
additionally  during  we recorded approximately million in share based compensation expense as a result of our adoption of statement no 
r 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  from in  increasing in absolute dollars from million in to million in the increase in sg a expense was primarily related to increased business volume  and recognition of deferred costs associated with our microwave communications contract with the uae 
additionally  during  we recorded approximately million in share based compensation expense as a result of our adoption of statement no 
r 
interest income interest income was approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in interest income resulted from higher interest rates and an increase in our average cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances in income taxes the provision for income taxes expressed as a percentage of pre tax income was in and in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  is less than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits  export sales benefits and the domestic manufacturing deduction offset by the effect of statement no 
r that does not allow deferred tax benefits to be recognized on compensation expense related to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
the tax provision for the year ended december  includes a reduction in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of approximately million 
other factors that reduced our effective tax rate below the us federal statutory rate included tax credits  export sales benefits and the reversal of approximately million in accrued income taxes related to a tax examination completed in march 
table of contents as a result of the factors set forth above  our income from continuing operations was million in  compared to million in our net income was million in  compared to million in liquidity and capital resources our business is dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and test subcontractors that are  in turn  dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
demand for semiconductors is cyclical and volatile 
we have implemented cost reduction programs aimed at aligning our ongoing operating costs with our currently expected revenues over the near term 
these cost management initiatives include consolidating facilities  reductions to headcount and reduced spending 
the cyclical and volatile nature of our industry makes estimates of future revenues  results of operations and net cash flows difficult 
our primary historical source of liquidity and capital resources has been cash flow generated by operations 
while we maintain a credit facility  we have not used this as a source of cash and do not intend to do so 
we use cash to fund growth in our operating assets  including accounts receivable and inventory  and to fund new products and product enhancements primarily through research and development 
liquidity working capital the following summarizes our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital december  december  percentage in thousands increase change cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital cash flows operating activities cash generated from operating activities consists of net income  adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
non cash items include depreciation and amortization  non cash share based compensation expense  and deferred income taxes 
our net cash flows provided from operating activities in totaled million compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the change in current assets and liabilities and included a decrease in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively and an increase in accounts payable of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to cash collections made during and decreased business volume within our semiconductor equipment business 
the decrease in inventory was a result of decreased order backlog within our semiconductor equipment business and our ongoing efforts to reduce inventory levels 
the increase in accounts payable was a result of the timing of cash payments primarily within our semiconductor equipment business 
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of cash used for capital expenditures in support of our businesses  proceeds from investment maturities  asset disposals and divestitures  and cash used for purchases of investments and business acquisitions 
our net cash provided from investing activities in totaled million and was primarily the result of million in net proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments  offset by million in cash used for purchases of short term investments 
we invest our excess cash  in an attempt to seek the highest available return while preserving capital  in short term investments since excess cash is only temporarily available and may be required for a business related purpose 
other expenditures in included the purchase of avs for million and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
the acquisition of avs was a strategic transaction to expand our digital microwave communications solutions  especially in high definition broadcast television and public safety and law enforcement applications within our microwave communications equipment business 
the purchases of property  plant and equipment were primarily made to support activities in our semiconductor equipment business and consisted primarily of equipment used in engineering  manufacturing and related functions 

table of contents financing activities cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans which totaled million during we issue stock options and maintain an employee stock purchase plan as components of our overall employee compensation 
we declared and paid dividends totaling million  or per common share  during on january   we announced a cash dividend of per share on our common stock  payable on  april  to stockholders of record as of march  we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders 
capital resources in may   we renewed our million unsecured bank line of credit bearing interest at the bank s prime rate 
the line of credit will expire in july   and requires that we maintain specified minimum levels of net worth  limits the amount of our capital expenditures and requires us to meet certain other financial covenants 
we are currently in compliance with these covenants 
no borrowings were outstanding at december   however  approximately million of the credit facility was allocated to standby letters of credit at december   leaving the balance of million available for future borrowings 
we expect that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and we anticipate that present working capital and available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  amounts excluded include our liability for unrecognized tax benefits that totaled approximately million at december  we are currently unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or periods cash settlement of this liability may occur 
fiscal year total in thousands non cancelable operating leases purchase commitments from time to time  we enter into commitments with our vendors to purchase inventory at fixed prices or in guaranteed quantities 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within relatively short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for the next three months 
off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  we provide standby letters of credit instruments to certain parties as required 
as of december   the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these standby letters of credit was approximately million 
no liability has been recorded in connection with these arrangements beyond those required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
based on historical experience and information currently available  we do not believe it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at december   our investment portfolio included short term  fixed income investment securities with a fair value of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the relatively short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate ten percent change in interest rates eg to would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk 
except for our subsidiary based in germany that conducts business in euros  we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars and as a result we have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are not significant 
the effect of an immediate ten percent change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
