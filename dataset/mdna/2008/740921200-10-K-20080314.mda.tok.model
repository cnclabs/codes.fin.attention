item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with premierwest s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as of december  and  and for each of the three years in the period ended december   that are included as exhibits in this report 
premierwest conducts a general commercial banking business  gathering deposits from the general public and applying those funds to the origination of loans for commercial  real estate  and consumer purposes and investments 
premierwest s profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated by interest earning assets principally loans and investments and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities principally customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the difference the interest rate spread between interest rates earned on interest earning assets and interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and by the relative volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
financial institutions have traditionally used interest rate spreads as a measure of net interest income 
another indication of an institution s net interest income is its net yield on interest earning assets or net interest margin  which is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
to a lesser extent  premierwest s profitability is also affected by such factors as the level of noninterest income and expenses  the provision for loan losses  and the provision for income taxes 
noninterest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts and fees generated through premierwest s mortgage division and investment services subsidiary 
noninterest expense consists primarily of salaries  commissions and employee benefits  professional fees  equipment expenses  occupancy related expenses  communications  advertising and other operating expenses 
financial highlights net income for was million  a improvement over net income of million 
our diluted earnings per share were and for the years ended and  respectively 
this improvement resulted from a million increase in interest income and a million increase in noninterest income and  decrease in the loan loss provision 
these results were offset by an million increase in interest expense  a million increase in noninterest expense and a  increase in the provision for income taxes 
return on average shareholders equity was and return on average assets was for the year ended december  this compared with a return on average shareholders equity of and a return on average assets of for years ended december  dollars in thousands except financial ratios net income    average assets    return on average assets net income    average equity    return on average equity cash dividends declared   net income    payout ratio average equity    average assets    average equity to asset ratio total loans outstanding  net of deferred loan fees  grew million  or in and totaled billion at december  compared to million at december  growth in loan volumes were generated internally across all of premierwest bank s market areas 
over the past year our allowance for loan loss increased to million totaling of outstanding loans 
the provision expense for loan losses was  for compared to  in management believes that an appropriate overall reserve exists based on our ongoing assessment of loan portfolio quality  the relatively stable level of average nonperforming assets over the past three operating years  continuing seasoning of acquired loan portfolios and our judgment of economic conditions that exist 
total deposits also grew to million at december   an increase of million from million at december  noninterest bearing demand deposits totaled million and accounted for of total deposits at year end compared to at december  the bank continues to aggressively pursue noninterest bearing deposit relationships from consumers and businesses 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates used  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  impairment of intangible assets  and contingencies and litigation 
estimates are based upon historical experience  current economic conditions and other factors that management considers reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates result in judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily available from other sources as well as assessing and identifying the accounting treatments of commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is established to absorb known and inherent losses attributable to loans and leases outstanding and related off balance sheet commitments 
the adequacy of the allowance is monitored on an ongoing basis and is based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and nonperforming trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience and other pertinent information 
as of december   approximately of premierwest s loan portfolio is secured by real estate 
accordingly  a significant rise in loan interest rates and or a decline in real estate values in oregon and california may cause management to increase the allowance for loan losses 
at december   premierwest had approximately million in unamortized goodwill as a result of previous business combinations 
premierwest adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  annual and periodic analysis of the fair value of recorded goodwill for impairment involves a substantial amount of judgment  as does establishing and monitoring estimated lives of other amortizable intangible assets 
effective january   premierwest bancorp adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to measure and recognize as compensation expense  the grant date fair market value for all share based awards 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair market value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value our stock options 
the black scholes model requires the use of assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  our expected dividend yield  the weighted average expected life of the options and the historical volatility of our stock price 
results of operations average balances  interest rates and yields the following tables set forth certain information relating to premierwest s consolidated average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and reflect the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the years indicated 
the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average daily balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods presented 
during the periods indicated  nonaccruing loans  if any  are included in the net loan category 
the yields and costs include fees  premiums and discounts  which are considered adjustments to yield

loan interest income includes loan fee income of million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
net interest income premierwest s profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated by interest earning assets principally loans and investments and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities principally customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the difference between rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and rates of interest paid on interest bearing liabilities the interest rate spread  as well as the relative volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
financial institutions have traditionally used interest rate spreads as a measure of net interest income 
another indication of an institution s net interest income is its net yield on interest earning assets or net interest margin  which is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis  before provisions for loan losses  for the year ended december   was million  an increase of compared to tax equivalent net interest income of million in  which was an increase of compared to tax equivalent net interest income of million in the overall tax equivalent earning asset yield was in compared to in and in for the same years  rates on interest bearing liabilities were  and  respectively 
total interest earning assets averaged million for the year ended december   compared to million for the corresponding period in the net growth in earning assets resulted from an overall growth in loan volume from all our geographic markets served 
growth in our higher yielding loan assets were partially offset by decreases in lower yielding federal funds sold and investment securities 
interest bearing liabilities averaged million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in interest expense  as a percentage of average earning assets  decreased to in  compared to in and in average loans  which generally carry a higher yield than investment securities and other earning assets  comprised of average earning assets during  compared to in and in during the same periods  average yields on loans were in  in  and in average investment securities comprised 
of average earning assets in  which was down from in and in tax equivalent interest yields on investment securities were for  for  and in the short term interest rate environment  as measured by the prime lending rate  remained stable from the end of the second quarter in until near the end of the third quarter of as was anticipated at the end of  rates began to decline during the latter half of as actions to lower short term rates by the federal reserve resulted in a basis point reduction in the prime rate on september   followed by separate basis point reductions occurring on october and december   respectively 
a nearly month period of stable interest rates leading up to these declines in the prime rate contributed to the narrowing of our interest rate spread as during this period of time  the repricing of our interest bearing deposits  which had lagged behind the previous period of rising interest rates  were repricing to higher interest rates while the loan portfolio yield remained relatively stable 
as a result  our net interest spread decreased basis points between and this in combination with the basis point overall drop in prime  which negatively impacted our loan portfolio yield during the fourth quarter of  resulted in a decline in our net interest margin by basis points from for to in our balance sheet is asset sensitive  accordingly  a declining interest rate environment will negatively impact our net interest margin 
rate volume analysis the following table analyzes net interest income on a tax equivalent basis in terms of changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and changes in net interest income that are attributable to changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the table reflects the extent to which changes in interest income and changes in interest expense are attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by the prior year rate and changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior year volume 
changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated to rate

the allowance is maintained at an amount believed to be sufficient to absorb losses in the loan portfolio and has two components  one of which represents estimated reserves based on assigned credit risk ratings for our entire loan portfolio  and the other representing specifically established reserves for individually classified loans 
factors considered in establishing an appropriate allowance include a careful assessment of the financial condition of the borrower  a realistic determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral  the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower  a comprehensive analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories  an assessment of pending legal action for collection of loans and related guarantees  and  a review of delinquent and classified loans 
premierwest applies a systematic process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  including an internal loan review program and a quarterly analysis of the adequacy of the allowance 
the quarterly analysis includes determination of specific potential loss factors on individual classified loans  historical potential loss factors derived from actual net charge off experience and trends in nonperforming loans  and potential loss factors for other loan portfolio risks such as loan concentrations  the condition of the local economy  and the nature and volume of loans 
the loan loss provision reflects management s judgment of the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
although management believes the loan loss provision has been sufficient to maintain an adequate reserve for loan losses  there can be no assurance that actual loan losses will not require more significant charges to operations in the future 
for the year ended december   the loan loss provision totaled  compared to  for  and  for this represents a decrease of between and and an increase of between and the large increase in the loan loss provision that occurred between and resulted from a relatively modest loan loss provision that was taken during because of a large recovery during that contributed to overall net loan loss recoveries of million 
during the bank continued to experience significant loan growth and the loan loss provision reflected this growth 
contributing to stable trends in overall credit quality has been the concerted effort on the part of management toward building and maintaining a consistent  proactive and responsive credit culture throughout the organization 
management has progressively evolved the company s loan policies and procedures  conducted an ongoing and comprehensive analysis of loan portfolio quality  increased the number of credit administration and internal audit personnel to oversee the consistent application and adherence to established loan policies and procedures and provided training to all lending personnel 
a more detailed review of the loan loss provision is presented in the table on page loan charge offs refer to the recorded values of loans actually removed from the consolidated balance sheet and  after netting out recoveries on previously charged off loans  become net charge offs 
premierwest s policy is to charge off loans when  in management s opinion  the loan or a portion thereof is deemed uncollectible  although concerted efforts are made to maximize recovery after the charge off 
management will continue to closely monitor the loan quality of new and existing relationships through strict review and evaluation procedures and by making loan officers accountable for collection efforts 
for the year ended december  and december   loan charge offs exceeded recoveries by  and  respectfully 
a more detailed review of charge offs and recoveries are presented in the table on page noninterest income noninterest income is primarily comprised of service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage origination fees  investment brokerage and annuity fees  other commissions and fees  and other noninterest income including gains on sales of investment securities 
deposit account related service charges and fees for other banking services have grown consistently over the past three years as a result of the bank s internal growth generally and also from increases made in our fee schedule for banking services 
mortgage origination fees  investment brokerage and annuity fees are commission based sources of revenue that reflected a net increase in revenue in compared with during noninterest income increased from million to million  an increase of million or 
overall  deposit service charge income increased  investment brokerage and annuity fees increased  other commissions and fees increased  other noninterest income increased  while mortgage origination income decreased  for  noninterest income increased or  from million recorded in to million 
overall deposit service charge income increased  mortgage banking income decreased  investment brokerage and annuity fees fell  other commissions and fees increased  while other noninterest income increased  gains from the sale of investment securities were in general  management prices the bank s deposit accounts at rates competitive with those offered by other commercial banks in its market area 
deposit and deposit fee growth have been generated by branch expansion  offering competitive deposit products  cultivating strong customer relationships through exceptional service and cross selling deposit products to loan customers 
noninterest expense noninterest expenses consist principally of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  communication expenses  professional fees  advertising and other expenses 
during  noninterest expense increased million or from million in to million in increased expenses were primarily other expenses million or 
there was a slight increase in salaries and employee benefits increasing  or and communications of  or 
the increases in total noninterest expense was offset by a decline in net occupancy expense by  or  decline in professional fees of  or  and a decline in advertising expenditures of  or during  noninterest expense increased million or from million in to million in as the bank continued to pursue its growth strategy through the opening of three new branch offices bringing the total number of branches to increased expenses were principally in salaries and employee benefits million or  occupancy expenses  or  and communications  professional fees and advertising expense  or 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in other expenses  or 
provision for income taxes premierwest s taxable income resulted in an effective tax rate of or million in federal and state income taxes for this compares to an effective tax rate of for and for efficiency ratio banks use the term efficiency ratio to describe the relationship of administrative and other costs associated with generating revenues  a concept similar to a measurement of overhead 
the efficiency ratio is computed by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income 
management views the efficiency ratio as a measure of premierwest s ability to control noninterest expenses 
management has been successful at achieving its targeted efficiency ratio in the low percent range 
for the year ended december   our efficiency ratio was  as compared to in  and in generally  lower efficiency ratios reflect greater cost controls  however  the success of premierwest s community banking strategy necessitates a balance between pure expense control and the need to maintain a high level of customer service in conjunction with effective risk management 
accordingly  premierwest staffs its branches in a manner to support its high standards for delivering exceptional customer service and maintains the necessary administrative personnel to support the delivery of exceptional customer service and effective risk management through internal control functions such as credit administration  internal audit  credit examination and compliance

investment portfolio investment securities provide a return on residual funds after lending activities 
investments may be in interest bearing deposits  us government and agency obligations  state and local government obligations or government guaranteed  mortgage backed securities 
premierwest generally does not invest in securities that are rated less than investment grade by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization 
all securities related investment activity is reported to the board of directors 
board review is required for significant changes in investment strategy 
certain senior executives have the authority to purchase and sell securities for our portfolio in accordance with premierwest s stated funds management policy 
management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase 
if management has the intent and premierwest has the ability at the time of purchase to hold a security until maturity or on a long term basis  the security is classified as held to maturity and is reflected on the balance sheet at historical cost 
securities to be held for indefinite periods and not intended to be held to maturity or on a long term basis are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are reflected on the balance sheet at their estimated fair market value

at december   premierwest s investment portfolio had total net unrealized losses of approximately  this compares to net unrealized losses of approximately  at december   and  at december  unrealized gains and losses reflect changes in market conditions and do not represent the amount of actual profits or losses that may be recognized by the bank 
actual realized gains and losses occur at the time investment securities are sold or called 
during the third quarter of  the bank reclassified obligations of states and political subdivisions from available for sale to held to maturity to more accurately reflect its purpose and intent to be reserved for the on going pledging needs  particularly for collateralizing public funds on deposit that exceed the  fdic insurance limit 
the unrealized holding gain at the time of transfer was  and is being amortized as an adjustment to yield from the date of transfer through the maturity date of each security transferred 
the amortization of the unrealized holding gain reported in shareholders equity will offset or mitigate the effect on interest income of the amortization of the discount for the securities transferred 
as of december   the unamortized unrealized holding loss on held to maturity securities was  securities may be pledged from time to time to secure public deposits  fhlb borrowings  repurchase agreement deposit accounts  or for other purposes as required or permitted by law 
at december   securities with a market value of million were pledged for such purposes 
as of december   premierwest also held  shares of par value federal home loan bank of seattle fhlb stock  which is a restricted equity security 
fhlb stock represents an equity interest in the fhlb  but it does not have a readily determinable market value 
the stock can be sold at its par value only  and only to the fhlb or to another member institution 
member institutions are required to maintain a minimum stock investment in the fhlb based on specific percentages of their outstanding mortgages  total assets or fhlb advances 
at december  and  the bank met its minimum required investment in fhlb 
the bank also owns stock in pacific coast banker s bank pcbb 
the investment in pcbb of  is carried at its fair market value at acquisition and is included in restricted equity investments on the balance sheet 
pacific coast banker s bank operates under a special purpose charter to provide wholesale correspondent banking services to depository institutions 
by statute  of pcbb s outstanding stock is held by depository institutions that utilize its correspondent banking services 
loan portfolio the most significant asset on our balance sheet in terms of risk and the effect on our earnings is our loan portfolio 
on our balance sheet  the term net loans refers to total loans outstanding  at their principal balance outstanding  net of the allowance for loan losses and deferred loan fees 
premierwest s loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing our lending operations 
generally  the guidelines address the types of loans that we seek  our target markets  underwriting and collateral requirements  terms  interest rate and yield considerations  and compliance with laws and regulations 
all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations 
these limitations apply to the borrower s total outstanding indebtedness to the bank  including the indebtedness of any guarantor 
the policies are reviewed and approved by the board of directors of premierwest on a routine basis 
bank officers are charged with loan origination in compliance with underwriting standards overseen by the credit administration department and in conformity with established loan policies 
on an as needed but not less than annual basis  the board of directors determines the lending authority of the bank s loan officers 
such delegated authority may include authority related to loans  letters of credit  overdrafts  uncollected funds  and such other authority as determined by the board  the president or chief credit officer within their own delegated authority 
the chief credit officer has the authority to approve loans up to a lending limit as set by the board of directors 
all loans above the lending limit of the chief credit officer  and up to a certain higher limit  may be approved jointly by the chief credit officer along with either the president or chief executive officer 
loans  that exceed this limit  are subject to review and approval by the board s loan committee 
all loans approved by the board loan committee are reviewed by the full board at regularly scheduled meetings 
premierwest s unsecured legal lending limit was approximately million and our real estate secured lending limit was approximately million at december  premierwest seldom makes loans for an amount approaching its legal lending limits

the largest category is concentrated in real estate loans  typical for a community bank and also due to management s focus on the significant growth opportunities existing within mortgage and commercial real estate activities occurring in the bank s market area 
some commercial loans are secured by real estate  but funds are used for purposes other than financing the purchase of real property  such as inventory financing and equipment purchases  where real property serves as collateral for the loan 
loans of this type are characterized as real estate loans because of the real estate held as collateral 
the following table presents maturity and re pricing information for the loan portfolio at december  the table segments the loan portfolio between fixed rate and adjustable rate loans and their respective repricing intervals based on fixed rate loan maturity dates and variable rate loan re pricing dates for the periods indicated

premierwest has no loans without a stated schedule for repayment or a stated maturity 
nonperforming loans management considers a loan to be nonperforming when it is days or more past due  or sooner when the bank has determined that repayment of the loan in full is unlikely 
generally  unless collateral for a loan is a one to four family residential dwelling  interest accrual ceases in days but no later than the date of acquisition by foreclosure  voluntary deed or other means and the loan is classified as nonperforming 
a loan placed on nonaccrual status may or may not be contractually past due at the time the determination is made to place the loan on nonaccrual status  and it may or may not be secured 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  it is the bank s policy to reverse interest previously accrued but uncollected 
interest later collected on the nonaccrual loan  for book purposes  is credited to loan principal if  in management s opinion  full collectibility of principal is doubtful 
at december  and  loans that were more than days delinquent or for which the accrual of interest had been discontinued included the following december  of of related related dollars in thousands amount portfolio amount portfolio commercial  real estate construction  real estate commercial residential consumer other total   impaired loans include all nonaccrual and restructured commercial and real estate loans 
loan impairment is measured as the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral of an impaired collateral dependent loan or an observable market price 
interest income on impaired loans is recognized by the cash basis method 
when the bank acquires real estate through foreclosure  voluntary deed  or similar means  it is classified as other real estate owned until it is sold 
on december  and there was no other real estate owned 
when property is acquired in this manner  it is recorded at the lower of cost the unpaid principal balance at the date of acquisition or fair value less estimated selling costs 
any further write down is charged to expense 
all costs incurred from the date of acquisition to maintain the property are expensed as incurred 
other real estate owned is appraised during the foreclosure process  before acquisition 
losses are recognized against the allowance for loan losses in the amount by which the cost value of the related loan exceeds the estimated net realizable value of the property acquired 
subsequent write downs are recorded as noninterest expense 
at december  and  nonperforming loans loans more than days delinquent and or on nonaccrual status totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the large dollar increase in non performing loans between and is concentrated in one million real estate construction loan that is a purchased participation from a bank with a national presence and for which management believes the credit is well secured 
management is committed to a credit culture that emphasizes quality underwriting standards and that provides for the effective monitoring of loan quality and aggressive resolution to problem loans once they are identified 
nonperforming assets amounted to of total assets outstanding at december  and at december  interest income that would have been recognized on nonaccrual loans if such loans had performed in accordance with contractual terms totaled  for the year ended december    for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  actual interest income recognized on such loans during all of the periods was not significant 
at december  and  the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans was  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes nonperforming assets by category december  dollars in thousands loans on nonaccrual status   loans past due greater than days but not on nonaccrual status other real estate owned total nonperforming assets   percentage of nonperforming assets to total assets allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through the provision for loan losses charged to expense and represents the aggregate of the loan loss provision charged against earnings as described above  net of loans charged off and recoveries on previously charged off loans 
the provision charged to operating expense is based on loan loss experience and other factors that  in management s judgment  should be recognized to estimate losses 
management monitors the loan portfolio to ensure that the reserve for loan losses remains adequate to absorb potential losses identified by the portfolio review process  including loans on nonaccrual status and current loans whose repayment according to the loan s repayment plan is considered by management to be in serious doubt 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors  including analysis of risks inherent in the various segments of the loan portfolio  management s assessment of known or potential problem credits which have come to management s attention during the ongoing review of credit quality  estimates of the value of underlying collateral and guarantees  legal representation regarding the potential outcome of pending actions for collection of loans and related guarantees  historical loss experience  and  current local and national economic conditions and other factors 
if actual circumstances and losses differ substantially from management s assumptions and estimates  the allowance for loan losses might not be sufficient to absorb all future losses 
net earnings would be adversely affected if that occurred 
loan loss estimates are reviewed periodically 
adjustments to the allowance  if any  are charged against or credited to earnings in the period in which the basis for the adjustment becomes known 
a downturn in the local oregon and or california economies and employment could result in increased levels of nonperforming assets and charge offs  increased loan loss provisions and reductions in income 
additionally  as an integral part of the examination process  bank regulatory agencies periodically review premierwest s allowance for loan losses 
the banking agencies could require the recognition of additions to the loan loss allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
premierwest s allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   and million at december   representing of total loans at december  and of total loans at december  the loan loss allowance represents of nonperforming loans at december   and of nonperforming loans at december  although management believes that it uses the best information available in providing for estimated loan losses and believes that the allowance was adequate at december   future adjustments could be necessary and net earnings could be negatively affected if circumstances and or economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses

the amount reclassified represents the off balance sheet credit exposure related to unfunded commitments to lend and letters of credit  and a  increase resulting from the purchase of a consumer finance loan portfolio on june  the following table shows the allocation of premierwest s allowance for loan losses by category and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the dates indicated 
premierwest allocates its allowance for loan losses to each loan classification based on relative risk characteristics 
general  specific and qualitative allocations are made based on estimated losses that are due to current credit circumstances and other available information for each loan category 
general allocations are based on historical loss factors 
specific allocations are related to loans on nonaccrual status  estimated reserves based on individual credit risk ratings  loans for which management believes the borrower might be unable to comply with loan repayment terms  even though the loans are not in nonaccrual status  and  loans for which supporting collateral might not be adequate to recover loan amounts if foreclosure and subsequent sale of collateral become necessary 
qualitative allocations include adjustments for economic conditions  concentrations and other subjective factors  and are intended to compensate for the subjective nature of the determination of losses inherent in the overall loan portfolio 
because the total loan loss allowance is a valuation reserve applicable to the entire loan portfolio  the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan category does not represent the total potential for future losses that may occur within that loan category

premierwest offers a number of deposit products to attract both commercial and consumer customers including regular checking and savings accounts  money market accounts  ira accounts  now accounts  and a variety of fixed maturity  fixed rate time deposits with maturities ranging from seven days to months 
these accounts earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management s desire to increase certain types or maturities of deposit liabilities 
the distribution of deposit accounts by type and rate is set forth in the following tables as of the indicated dates

interest bearing account balances tend to grow or decline as premierwest adjusts its pricing and product strategies based on market conditions  including competing deposit products 
at december   total interest bearing deposit accounts were million  an increase of million  or  from december  management utilizes brokered deposits with maturities that are typically less than one year as a short term funding source for loan growth 
brokered deposits are classified as time deposits that are less than  but are not considered core deposits 
at december  brokered deposits totaled million  or of total deposits  there were no brokered deposits as of december  at december   time deposits of  and over totaled million  or of total outstanding deposits  compared to million  or  of total outstanding deposits at december   and million  or  of total outstanding deposits at december  the following table sets forth  by time remaining to maturity  time deposit accounts outstanding at december  time deposits of time deposits less  or more than  dollars in thousands amount percentage amount percentage three months or less   over three months through six months  over six months through months  over months   total   short term and long term borrowings and other contractual obligations the following table sets forth certain information with respect to premierwest s short term borrowings from federal home loan bank fhlb cash management advances cma and federal funds purchased years ended december  fhlb federal fhlb federal fhlb federal cma funds cma funds cma funds advances purchased advances purchased advances purchased dollars in thousands amount outstanding at end of period   weighted average interest rate at end of period n a maximum amount outstanding at any month end during the year    average amount outstanding during the period     average weighted interest rate during the period premierwest had long term borrowings outstanding with the federal home loan bank of seattle fhlb totaling  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the bank makes monthly principal and interest payments on the long term borrowings which mature between and and bear interest at rates ranging from to 
the bank also participates in the cash management advance program cma with the fhlb 
cma borrowings outstanding were million at december  at december   the bank had total fhlb borrowings of million against an available collateral base of approximately million 
all outstanding borrowings with the fhlb are collateralized by a blanket pledge agreement principally covering loans in the bank s portfolio that are secured by st liens against family or multi family residential properties as well as the bank s fhlb stock and potentially any funds  investment securities or loans on deposit with the fhlb 
at december   two wholly owned special purpose subsidiary trusts established by premierwest bancorp had issued million of pooled trust preferred securities 
trust preferred securities accrue and pay distributions periodically at specified annual rates as provided in the indentures 
the trusts used the net proceeds from the offering to purchase a like amount of junior subordinated debentures the debentures of the company 
the debentures are the sole assets of the trusts 
the company s obligations under the debentures and related documents  taken together  constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the company of the obligations of the trusts 
the trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the debentures  or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indentures 
the company has the right to redeem the debentures in whole but not in part on or after specific dates  at a redemption price specified in the indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date 
by issuing trust preferred securities the company is able to secure a long term source of borrowed funds in support of its growth needs with a debt instrument that is includable as capital for regulatory purposes in the calculation of its risk based capital ratios 
under current federal reserve bank policy  all of the outstanding debentures  subject to certain limitations  have been included in the determination of tier i capital for regulatory purposes

premierwest is a party to numerous contractual financial obligations including repayment of borrowings  operating lease payments and commitments to extend credit under off balance sheet arrangements 
the scheduled repayment of long term borrowings and other contractual obligations is as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years years long term borrowings operating lease obligations   junior subordinated debentures  total     off balance sheet arrangements significant off balance sheet commitments at december  include commitments to extend credit of million and standby letters of credit of million

premierwest has adopted policies to maintain a relatively liquid position to enable it to respond to changes in the financial environment and ensure sufficient funds are available to meet customers needs for borrowing and deposit withdrawals 
generally  premierwest s major sources of liquidity are customer deposits  sales and maturities of investment securities  the use of borrowings from the fhlb and correspondent banks  and net cash provided by operating activities 
as of december   unused and available lines of credit totaled million from fhlb s cash management advance program and million from correspondent banks 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments are not as stable because they are influenced by general interest rate levels  competing interest rates available on other investments  market competition  economic conditions  and other factors 
liquid asset balances include cash  amounts due from other banks  federal funds sold  and investment securities available for sale 
at december   these liquid assets totaled million or of total assets as compared to million or of total assets at december  total liquid assets of million as of december   compare to million or of total assets at december  our liquidity continues to tighten as loan volumes have grown faster than our ability to build deposits as our preferred source of funding 
further  our securities portfolio has declined from calls and maturities to a point where of our securities portfolio is committed towards pledging requirements for collateralizing public funds deposits that exceed the fdic insurance limits 
it is expected that continued strong loan growth and the highly competitive marketplace for local deposits will result in the continued reliance on a combination of short term borrowings and brokered deposits to augment core deposits as a stable source of funding 
management continues to focus on strategies to grow the bank s core deposit base  while exploring alternative wholesale funding avenues 
the bank maintains contingency plans to address its liquidity needs including borrowing capacity through the federal home loan bank and other correspondent banks to support its funding needs that are not covered by our core deposit base 
management has elected to pursue strategies for building relationship oriented core deposits over time rather than aggressively attracting higher cost transactional time deposits from within our local markets 
analysis of liquidity should include a review of the changes that appear in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  the statement of cash flows includes operating  investing  and financing categories 
operating activities include net income of million and million in adjustments for non cash items and changes in cash due to changes in certain assets and liabilities 
investing activities consist primarily of proceeds from sold or matured securities and purchases of securities  the impact of the net growth in loans  and purchases of premises and equipment 
financing activities present the cash flows associated with the change in deposit accounts  changes in long term and other borrowings and various shareholder transactions 
at december   premierwest had outstanding unfunded lending commitments of million 
nearly all of these commitments represented unused portions of credit lines available to businesses 
many of these credit lines are not expected to be fully drawn upon and  accordingly  the aggregate commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
management believes that premierwest s sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet likely calls on outstanding commitments  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation have established minimum requirements for capital adequacy for financial holding companies and member banks 
the requirements address both risk based capital and leveraged capital 
the regulatory agencies may establish higher minimum requirements if  for example  a corporation has previously received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk like other financial institutions  premierwest is subject to interest rate risk 
interest earning assets could mature or re price more rapidly than  or on a different basis from  interest bearing liabilities primarily borrowings and deposits with short and medium term maturities in a period of declining interest rates 
although having assets that mature or re price more frequently on average than liabilities will be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  such an asset liability structure will result in lower net interest income during periods of declining interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity  or interest rate risk  relates to the effect of changing interest rates on net interest income 
interest earning assets with interest rates tied to the prime rate for example  or that mature in relatively short periods of time  are considered interest rate sensitive 
interest bearing liabilities with interest rates that can be re priced in a discretionary manner  or that mature in relatively short periods of time  are also considered interest rate sensitive 
the differences between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities over various time horizons are commonly referred to as sensitivity gaps 
as interest rates change  the sensitivity gap will have either a favorable effect or an adverse effect on net interest income 
a negative gap with liabilities repricing more rapidly than assets generally should have a favorable effect when interest rates are falling  and an adverse effect when rates are rising 
a positive gap with assets repricing more rapidly than liabilities generally should have the opposite effect an adverse effect when rates are falling and a favorable effect when rates are rising 
the following table illustrates the maturities or repricing of premierwest s assets and liabilities as of december   based upon the contractual maturity or contractual repricing dates of loans and the contractual maturities of time deposits and borrowings 
prepayment assumptions have not been applied to fixed rate mortgage loans 
demand loans  loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity  and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less 
dollars in thousands by repricing interval months months years over years total assets interest earning assets federal funds sold and interest earning deposits  investment securities   loans     total    liabilities interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand and savings   time deposits    borrowings    total    interest rate sensitivity gap  cumulative   cumulative gap as a of interest earning assets for purposes of the gap analysis  loans are not reduced by the allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans 
unearned discounts and deferred loan fees are also excluded 
this analysis of interest rate sensitivity has a number of limitations 
the gap analysis above is based upon assumptions concerning such matters as when assets and liabilities will re price in a changing interest rate environment 
because these assumptions are no more than estimates  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or repricing within a stated period might actually mature or re price at different times and at different volumes from those estimated 
the actual prepayments and withdrawals after a change in interest rates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the data shown in the table 
certain assets  adjustable rate loans for example  commonly have provisions that limit changes in interest rates each time the interest rate changes and on a cumulative basis over the life of the loan 
also  the renewal or repricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debt could diminish after an interest rate increase 
therefore  the gap table above does not and cannot necessarily indicate the actual future impact of general interest movements on net interest income 
in addition to a static gap analysis of interest rate sensitivity  premierwest also attempts to monitor interest rate risk from the perspective of changes in the economic value of equity  also referred to as net portfolio value npv  and changes in net interest income 
changes to the npv and net interest income are simulated using instant and permanent rate shocks of plus and minus basis points  in increments of basis points 
these results are then compared to prior periods to determine the effect of previously implemented strategies 
if estimated changes to npv or net interest income are not within acceptable limits  the board may direct management to adjust its asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within acceptable limits 
the npv calculations are based on the net present value of discounted cash flows  using market prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest for each asset and liability product type based on its characteristics 
the theoretical projected change in npv and net interest income over a month period under each of the instantaneous and permanent rate shocks have been calculated by premierwest using computer simulation 
premierwest s simulation analysis forecasts net interest income and earnings given unchanged interest rates stable rate scenario 
the model then estimates a percentage change from the stable rate scenario under scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates over various time horizons 
the simulation model based on december  data  estimates that if a decline of basis points occurs  net interest income could be unfavorably affected up to approximately  while a similar increase in market rates would have a favorable impact of approximately 
because of uncertainties about customer behavior  refinance activity  absolute and relative loan and deposit pricing levels  competitor pricing and market behavior  product volumes and mix  and other unexpected changes in economic events affecting movements and volatility in market rates  there can be no assurance that simulation results are reliable indicators of earnings under such conditions 
net increase decrease in net net interest income interest return on in thousands margin equity as of december   the prime rate was prime rate increase of basis points to  basis points to  prime rate decrease of basis points to  basis points to  tax adjusted at a rate 
it is premierwest s policy to manage interest rate risk to maximize long term profitability under the range of likely interest rate scenarios
