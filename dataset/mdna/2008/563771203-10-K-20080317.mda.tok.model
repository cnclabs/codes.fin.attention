item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial position and our results of operations for each of the three years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with item consolidated financial statements and related notes  beginning on page f of this report and with other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
unless stated otherwise  all financial information presented below  throughout this report  and in the consolidated financial statements and related notes includes mannatech and all of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
company overview since november  we have developed innovative  high quality  proprietary nutritional supplements  topical and skin care products  and weight management products that are sold through a global network marketing system operating in the united states  canada  australia  the united kingdom  japan  new zealand  the republic of korea  taiwan  denmark  and germany 
new zealand is serviced by our australian subsidiary and denmark and germany are serviced by our united kingdom subsidiary 
our australian and united kingdom subsidiaries each operate as limited risk service providers for mannatech swiss holdings gmbh swiss  the parent company of our international subsidiaries 
the swiss parent owns all of the sales and inventories and accrues all commissions and cost of sales in new zealand  australia  the united kingdom  denmark  and germany 
the swiss parent pays the limited risk service providers a management fee for processing and shipping orders in australia  new zealand  the united kingdom  denmark  and germany 
we operate as a single business segment and primarily sell our products through a network of approximately  independent associates and members who have purchased our products and or packs within the last months  which we refer to as current independent associates and members 
we operate as a seller of nutritional supplements through our network marketing distribution channels operating in ten different countries 
we review and analyze our net sales by geographical location and further analyze our net sales by packs and by products 
each of our subsidiaries sells the same types of products and possesses similar economic characteristics  such as selling prices and gross margins 
because we sell our products through network marketing distribution channels  the opportunities and challenges that affect us most are recruitment and retention of independent associates and members  entry into new markets and growth of existing markets  niche market development  new product introduction  and investment in our infrastructure 
during the year ended december   we were subjected to certain negative publicity resulting from heightened litigation and regulatory activities 
see note litigation to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of such legal proceedings 
in addition  at the end of march  we had to delay processing orders for approximately one week as we began implementing phase ii of our enterprise resource planning erp system  which included the launching of our new corporate website 
after implementation  we experienced additional processing and customer service delays as our employees and customers transitioned to our new erp system 
the delays were largely caused by the need for additional training and an increase in customer service call volume related to implementing our new erp system 
although we believe our new erp system has been largely stabilized  we are currently adding additional functionality and re working our corporate website order placement 
we will continue to refine our erp system in the future and the costs associated with adding new functionality to our erp system will be capitalized 
to address the independent associate and member concerns about the negative publicity and erp system implementation issues  we extended the qualification period of our annual global travel incentive from late april to mid june 
in addition  in august  we changed our customer testimonial policy  and changed our sales return policy from to a satisfaction guarantee policy for the first days following a product s purchase 
furthermore  we are strengthening our multi faceted educational  compliance  and marketing programs

consolidated net sales for the year ended december   increased by million or as compared to the same period in international sales have experienced growth  which generated million in incremental net sales for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the international sales growth in was largely associated with greater sales volume in korea  taiwan  japan  and germany driven by the continued growth of our phytomatrix and optimal skin care system sales  introduced in japan and other asian countries in  as well as the introduction of advanced ambrotose in japan in however  net sales for the year ended december   for canada  australia  new zealand  denmark  and the united kingdom decreased slightly compared to the same period in the overall increase in international net sales was offset by a decrease in domestic sales  which we believe was affected by independent associate and member concerns related to certain negative publicity from litigation and regulatory activities  and delays in processing orders caused by implementation issues in our erp system 
the decline in domestic sales was partially offset by the introduction of our optimal skin care system and optimal support packets into north america in late march overall  the appreciation of foreign currencies had approximately a million favorable impact on net sales in our total sales and sales mix can be influenced by any of the following changes in our sales prices  changes in consumer demand  changes in competitors products  changes in economic conditions  changes in regulations  announcements of new scientific studies and breakthroughs  introduction of new products  discontinuation of existing products  adverse publicity  and changes in our commissions and incentives programs 
our sales mix for the years ended december  was as follows change dollar percentage in millions  except percentages product sales pack sales other  including freight total net sales in april  we began operating our new erp system  which allowed us to separately quantify deferred revenue associated with sales of packs and products that were shipped but not yet received by customers 
as a result  in april  we began recording deferred revenue related to packs with pack sales and deferred revenue associated with products with product sales 
for the year ended december   we recorded deferred revenue of million for product sales and for pack sales 
for the year ended december   we recorded deferred revenue of million related to packs and products shipped but not yet received by customers in other sales rather than in the applicable pack or product sales category because our previous computer system could not separately differentiate deferred revenue associated with packs and products 

table of contents the increase in our consolidated net sales consisted of a change in the mix of packs and products sold 
pack sales generally correlate to the number of new independent associates and members who purchase a starter pack and with the number of continuing independent associates who purchase upgrade or renewal packs 
however  there is not a direct correlation between the number of new and continuing independent associates and members purchasing packs and the amount of product sales because independent associates and members may consume different products at different consumption levels 
product sales for the year ended december   product sales grew million  or  as compared to the same period in of the million increase in product sales  million of the increase was attributable to the introduction of new products 
the increase was offset by a decrease in existing product sales of million and deferred revenue of million  which was previously recorded in other sales 
we believe existing product sales decreased primarily due to independent associate and member concerns over certain negative publicity and litigation and regulatory activities and the delays in order processing due to the implementation of our erp system 
the following new products were introduced during optimal skin care in north america and australia  optimal support packets in north america  advanced ambrotose capsules in international markets  and phytomatrix in australia and new zealand

however  we experienced a decrease in the number of new independent associates and members purchasing starter packs as compared to the same period in we believe the decrease in new independent associates and members purchasing starter packs may relate to certain negative publicity  customer difficulty adapting to our new erp system  changes to our corporate website and independent associate and member concerns resulting from ongoing litigation and regulatory activities 

table of contents additional actions we took in to help increase the number of independent associates and members are as follows registered our most popular products in all countries of operations  focused on new product development  explored new international markets  launched an aggressive marketing and educational campaign  expanded our annual travel incentive for one additional business period  instituted a satisfaction guarantee program  strengthened compliance initiatives  concentrated on publishing results of research studies and clinical trials related to our products  initiated additional incentives  and explored new advertising and educational tools to broaden name recognition

table of contents for the year ended december   other sales decreased by million to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to a decrease in freight revenue of million and an increase in costs related to sales refunds of million 
freight revenue decreased due to the change in the sales mix between countries in which freight is charged to customers and those in which it is not

table of contents income from our international operations is subject to taxation in the countries in which we operate 
although we may receive foreign income tax credits that would reduce the total amount of income taxes owed in the united states  we may not be able to fully utilize our foreign income tax credits in the united states 
we use the recognition and measurement provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  fas  to account for income taxes 
the provisions of fas require a company to record a valuation allowance when the more likely than not criterion for realizing net deferred tax assets cannot be met 
furthermore  the weight given to the potential effect of such evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
as a result  we reviewed the operating results  as well as all of the positive and negative evidence related to realization of such deferred tax assets to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in each tax jurisdiction 
as of december  and  we maintained our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in taiwan totaling million and million  respectively  as we believe the more likely than not criterion for recognition and realization purposes  as defined in fas  cannot be met

overall  our consolidated net sales for the year ended december  increased by million  or  compared to the same period in however  net sales for australia  new zealand  and the united kingdom decreased 
the decrease in the united kingdom was the result of heightened activities in the new markets of denmark and germany 
the decrease in net sales for australia and new zealand was the result of continued consumer questions concerning the reformulation of advanced ambrotose 
the original formulation of advanced ambrotose was introduced in the united states in march and then in other countries in the second half of because the initial reaction by some consumers to the original formula of advanced ambrotose was unfavorable  we introduced a reformulated advanced ambrotose in mid the reformulated advanced ambrotose contains a compound  created using the latest technology  which allows a more potent concentration of the full range of mannose containing polysaccharides occurring naturally in aloe to be produced in a stable powdered form 
this technology allows the compound to possess the most potent immunostimulatory properties because it does not strip the compound of its natural mineral counterparts by organic solvent precipitation  and most importantly  allows the compound to retain a high proportion of molecular weight polysaccharides that are believed to be responsible for the effective immune stimulating properties of aloe 
this enhanced immune stimulating capability has been demonstrated by independent biological assays conducted by hyperion biotechnology 
to help offset the decrease in net sales associated with the questions surrounding our reformulated advanced ambrotose that we experienced in the third quarter of  we launched multi faceted educational and marketing programs to explain the science behind the superior quality and potency of our reformulated advanced ambrotose 
additionally  with the cooperation of our independent associates  we developed a multi tiered marketing program  which includes a number of published articles  tours  other publications  marketing materials and web casts  and conference calls in an effort to further emphasize the advantages of our reformulated advanced ambrotose

as of december  and  we maintained our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the republic of korea and taiwan totaling million and million  respectively  as we believe the more likely than not criterion for recognition and realization purposes  as defined in fas  cannot be met 
the dollar amount of the provisions for income taxes is directly impacted by our profitability and a change in the mix of taxable income between countries 
for the year ended december   our effective income tax rate decreased to from as compared to the same period in our effective income tax rate decreased as compared to because of an increase in favorable permanent differences  as well as a change in the mix of taxable income between countries 
during  we realized a significant favorable permanent difference in research and experimentation income tax credits  which favorably impacted our effective income tax rate 
seasonality we believe the impact of seasonality on our consolidated results of operations is minimal 
we have experienced and believe we will continue to experience variations on our quarterly results of operations in response to  among other things the timing of the introduction of new products and incentives  our ability to attract and retain associates and members  the timing of our incentives and contests  
table of contents the general overall economic outlook  government regulations  the outcome of certain lawsuits  the perception and acceptance of network marketing  and the consumer perception of our products and overall operations 
as a result of these and other factors  our quarterly results may vary significantly in the future 
period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance since we can give no assurances that revenue trends in new markets  as well as in existing markets  will follow our historical patterns 
the market price of our common stock may also be adversely affected by the above factors 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal use of cash is to pay for operating expenses  including commissions and incentives  capital assets  inventory purchases  funding international expansion  and payment of quarterly cash dividends 
we generally fund our business objectives  operations  and expansion of our operations through net cash flows from operations rather than incurring long term debt 
we plan to continue to fund our needs through net cash flows from operations 
at december   we have million in cash and cash equivalents and million in investments  which can be used along with our normal cash flows from operations to fund any unanticipated shortfalls in future cash flows 
cash and cash equivalents and investments at december   our cash and cash equivalents increased by  or million  to million as compared to million at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents was directly attributable to current operations and sales of investments of million  which was offset by funding our erp system  payment of dividends to our investors  and restricting additional cash 
at december   our investments decreased by  or million  to million as compared to million at december  our investments can be readily liquidated  if necessary  to help fund operations 
working capital working capital accounts include cash and cash equivalents  receivables  inventories  prepaid expenses  deferred revenues  payables  and accrued expenses 
at december   our working capital decreased by million  or  to million from million at december  the decrease in working capital is primarily related to the use of current assets to fund capital expenditures  the accrual for ongoing litigation  offset by the sale of long term investments 
although we can give no assurances  we believe our working capital will remain relatively unchanged as we monitor our existing cash flow needs with our current long term investment strategy 
net cash flows our net consolidated cash flows consist of the following  for the years ended december provided by used in in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities for the years ended december    and  our net operating activities provided cash of million  million  and million  respectively 
for the years ended december    and  net earnings adjusted for noncash activities provided cash of million  million  and million  respectively  and our working capital accounts provided used cash of million  million  and million 
we expect that our net operating cash flows in will continue to be sufficient to fund our current operations and future quarterly cash dividends 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels  or will continue to declare and pay dividends 
certain events  such as an unfavorable outcome against us with respect to current litigation  could impact our available cash or our 
table of contents ability to generate cash flows from operations 
see risk factors we are not required to pay dividends  and our board of directors could decide not to declare a dividend or could reduce the amount of the dividend at any time in item a of this form k for further discussion related to future payment of dividends 
investing activities for the years ended december    and  our net investing activities used cash of million  million  and million  respectively 
in  we used cash of million to purchase capital assets and million as collateral for credit card payments in the republic of korea  which was partially offset by sales of investments of million 
in  we used cash of million to purchase capital assets  million to purchase investments  and million as collateral for credit card payments in the republic of korea  which was partially offset by releasing million of restricted cash to operations related to the expiration of a letter of credit for our travel incentive 
in  we used cash of million to purchase capital assets and million to purchase investments  which was partially offset by releasing million of restricted cash from collateral related to our travel incentive 
capital asset purchases included capitalized costs associated with the development of our new erp system 
in  we substantially completed the development of phase i of our new erp system 
in  we began configuring phase ii and in april we implemented phase ii 
in the second and third quarters of  we completed further stabilization activities and added additional functionality to our erp system 
for the year ended december   we capitalized million for the erp system 
in  we anticipate using cash of between and million to purchase other capital assets for use in our operations  for expansion of our corporate facilities and for planned international expansion 
financing activities in  we used cash of million to fund our net financing activities 
during  we used cash of million to fund payment of quarterly cash dividends to our shareholders and used cash of million to repay capital leases 
these uses of cash were partially offset by receiving cash of million and recording an income tax benefit of million related to option holders exercising their stock options 
in  we used cash of million to fund our net financing activities 
during  we used cash of million to pay quarterly cash dividend payments to shareholders  used cash of million to purchase our common stock in the open market  and used cash of million to repay capital leases 
these uses of cash were partially offset by receiving cash of million and recording an income tax benefit of million related to option holders exercising their stock options 
in  we used cash of million to fund our net financing activities 
during  we used cash of million to purchase our common stock in the open market and used cash of million to fund quarterly cash dividend payments to shareholders 
these uses of cash were partially offset by receiving cash of million from option holders exercising their stock options 
general liquidity and cash flows we continue to generate positive cash flows from operations and believe our existing liquidity and cash flows from operations are adequate to fund our normal expected future business operations  our estimated payments of cash dividends  the repurchase of our common stock in the open market  and international expansion costs for the next to months 
however  if our existing capital resources or cash flows become insufficient to meet current business plans  projections  and existing capital requirements  we would be required to modify 
table of contents our payment of future dividends and raise additional funds  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
see risk factors we are not required to pay dividends  and our board of directors could decide not to declare a dividend or could reduce the amount of the dividend at any time in item a of this form k for further discussion related to future payment of dividends 
contractual obligations 
the following summarizes our future commitments and obligations associated with various agreements and contracts as of december   for the years ending december thereafter total in thousands capital lease obligations purchase obligations operating leases post employment royalty employment agreements fin obligations  including interest and penalties other contractual obligations total commitments and obligations the timing of future payments of our uncertain tax positions of million is uncertain 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have maintained purchase commitments with certain of our raw material suppliers to purchase minimum quantities and help ensure exclusivity of our raw materials and proprietorship of our products 
currently  we have four supply agreements that require minimum purchase commitments 
we expect to exceed our minimum monthly required purchase commitments 
we also maintain other supply agreements and manufacturing agreements to protect our products  regulate product costs  and help ensure quality control standards 
these agreements do not require us to purchase any set minimums 
we have no present commitments or agreements with respect to acquisitions or purchases of any manufacturing facilities  however  management from time to time explores the possibility of the benefits of purchasing a raw material manufacturing facility to help control costs of our raw materials and help ensure quality control standards 
in  we substantially completed the first phase of our fully integrated internally developed software system and designed the second phase of our fully integrated global internally developed software system 
in  we completed the design and customization of phase ii of our fully integrated internally developed software system which began in in  capital expenditures are expected to be between million and million 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entity arrangements  nor do we have any off balance sheet arrangements 
market risks please see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk under item a of this form k for additional information about our market risks 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and 
table of contents assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use estimates throughout our financial statements  which are influenced by management s judgment and uncertainties 
our estimates are based on historical trends  industry standards  and various other assumptions that we believe are applicable and reasonable under the circumstances at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our audit committee reviews our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we continually evaluate and review our policies related to the portrayal of our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations that require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we also analyze the need for certain estimates  including the need for such items as allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  long lived fixed assets and capitalization of internal use software development costs  reserve for uncertain income tax positions and tax valuation allowances  revenue recognition  sales returns  and deferred revenues  accounting for stock based compensation  and contingencies and litigation 
historically  our estimates and assumptions have not materially deviated from our estimates 
however  we caution readers that actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if circumstances change relating to the various assumptions or conditions used in our estimates  we could experience an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we have identified the following applicable critical accounting policies and estimates as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consists of receivables from manufacturers  independent associates  and members and are carried at their estimated collectible amounts 
as of december   net accounts receivable totaled million 
historically  estimates for doubtful accounts have been immaterial 
however  in april  with the implementation of our erp system  we now simultaneously receive payment for an order when the order ships  and the new erp system creates a receivable for the payment if the payment is rejected or if it does not match the order total 
we periodically review receivables for realizability and base collectibility upon assumptions  historical trends  and recent account activities 
if our estimates regarding estimated collectibility are inaccurate or consumer trends change in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to additional write offs or bad debts 
as of december   we have an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
inventory reserves inventory consists of raw materials  work in progress  finished goods  and promotional materials that are stated at the lower of cost using standard costs that approximate average costs or market 
we record the amounts charged by the vendors as the costs of inventory 
typically  the net realizable value of our inventory is higher than the aggregate cost 
determination of net realizable value can be complex and  therefore  requires a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of net realizable value  the following items are considered inventory turnover statistics  current selling prices  seasonality factors  consumer demand  regulatory changes  competitive pricing  and performance of similar products 
if we determine the carrying value of inventory is in excess of estimated net realizable value  we write down the value of inventory to the estimated net realizable value 
we also review inventory for obsolescence in a similar manner and any inventory identified as obsolete is reserved or written off 
our determination of obsolescence is based on assumptions about the demand for our products  product expiration dates  estimated future sales  and general future plans 
we monitor actual sales compared to original projections  and if actual sales are less favorable than those originally projected by us  we record an additional inventory reserve or write down 
historically  our estimates have been close to our actual reported amounts 
however  if our estimates regarding fair market value or obsolescence are inaccurate or consumer demand for our products changes in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to additional material losses or gains in excess of our established estimated inventory reserves 
generally  we carry inventory reserves ranging between million and million 
at december   the carrying value of our inventory was million 

table of contents long lived fixed assets and capitalization of software development costs in addition to capitalizing long lived fixed asset costs  we also capitalize costs associated with internally developed software projects collectively fixed assets and amortize such costs over the estimated useful lives of such fixed assets 
fixed assets are carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation computed using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining lease terms or the estimated useful lives of the improvements 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
if a fixed asset is sold or otherwise retired or disposed of  the cost of the fixed asset and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is written off and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in other operating costs in our consolidated statement of operations 
we review our fixed assets for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable  such as plans to dispose of an asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
our impairment review includes a comparison of future projected cash flows generated by the asset  or group of assets  with its associated net carrying value 
if the net carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
the fair value is determined by calculating the discounted expected future cash flows using an estimated risk free rate of interest 
any identified impairment losses are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the carrying value of the fixed asset is adjusted to the new carrying value and any subsequent increases in fair value of the fixed asset are not recorded 
in addition  if we determine the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be reduced from our original estimate  the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively  based on the new remaining useful life of the fixed asset 
the impairment calculation requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows  strategic plans  useful lives  and discount rates 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge  which could be material to our results of operations 
in addition  if accounting standards change  or if fixed assets become obsolete  we may be required to write off any unamortized costs of fixed assets  or if estimated useful lives change  we would be required to accelerate depreciation or amortization periods and recognize additional depreciation expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
historically our estimates and assumptions related to the carrying value and the estimated useful lives of our fixed assets have not materially deviated from actual results 
as of december   the estimated useful lives and net carrying values of fixed assets are as follows estimated useful life net carrying value at december  office furniture and equipment to years million computer hardware and software to years million automobiles to years million leasehold improvements to years million construction in progress to years million total net carrying value at december  million we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful estimated life of the leased asset or the lease term 
construction in process includes fixed assets  leasehold improvements and internally developed software costs 
once placed in service  leasehold improvements will be amortized over the shorter of an asset s useful life or the remaining lease term 
once the internally developed software is placed in service  it will be amortized over three to five years 

table of contents the net carrying costs of fixed assets and construction in progress are exposed to impairment losses if our assumptions and estimates of their carrying values change  there is a change in estimated future cash flow  or there is a change in the estimated useful life of the fixed asset 
uncertain income tax positions and tax valuation allowances as of december   we recorded million in taxes payable and million in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet related to uncertain income tax positions 
as required by fin  we use judgments and make estimates and assumptions related to evaluating the probability of uncertain income tax positions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the potential liability related to an assessment of whether the income tax position will more likely than not be sustained in an income tax audit 
we are also subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax  sales and use tax  personal property tax  and other forms of taxation 
these audits examine our tax positions  timing of income and deductions  and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions 
as part of our evaluation of these tax issues  we establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures 
depending on the nature of the tax issue  we could be subject to audit over several years 
therefore  our estimated reserve balances and liability related to uncertain income tax positions may exist for multiple years before the applicable statute of limitations expires or before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority 
we believe our tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions are based upon reasonable judgment and estimates  however  if actual results materially differ  our effective income tax rate and cash flows could be affected in the period of discovery or resolution 
we also review the estimates and assumptions used in evaluating the probability of realizing the future benefits of our deferred tax assets and record a valuation allowance when we believe that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
if we are unable to realize the expected future benefits of our deferred tax assets  we are required to provide a valuation allowance 
we use our past history and experience  overall profitability  future management plans  and current economic information to evaluate the amount of valuation allowance to record 
as of december   we maintained a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets arising from our operations in taiwan because they did not meet the more likely than not criteria as defined by the recognition and measurement provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in addition  as of december   we had deferred tax assets  after valuation allowance  totaling million  which may not be realized if our assumptions and estimates change  which would affect our effective income tax rate and cash flows in the period of discovery or resolution 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue we derive revenues from sales of our products  sales of our starter and renewal packs  and shipping fees 
substantially all of our product and pack sales are made to independent associates at published wholesale prices 
we also sell products to independent members at discounted published retail prices 
we record revenue net of any sales taxes 
total deferred revenue consists of i revenue received from sales of packs and products shipped but not received by the customers at period end  ii revenue received for a one year magazine subscription  iii revenue received from pack sales when the pack sale price exceeds the wholesale value of all individual components within the pack  and iv revenue received from prepaid registration fees from customers planning to attend a future corporate sponsored event 
we recognize deferred revenue from shipped packs and products upon receipt by the customer 
we recognize deferred revenue related to future corporate sponsored events when the event is held 
all other deferred revenue is recognized over one year 
at december   total deferred revenue was million 
although we have no immediate plans to significantly change the contents of our packs or our shipping methods  any such change in the future could result in additional revenue deferrals or cause us to recognize deferred revenue over a longer period of time 
for example  if we were to decrease the number of items included in our packs while keeping the sales price of the packs the same  we would have to defer additional revenue and recognize the additional deferred revenue over one year 

table of contents we have three different product return policies i a policy for our retail customers  ii a policy for our independent members  and iii a policy for our independent associates 
retail customers may return any of our products  within days of purchase  to the original independent associate who sold the product  who is then required to provide the retail customer with a full cash refund 
the independent associate may then forward proof of the refund to us to receive a replacement product 
members may return an order to us within days of the purchase date without membership termination or restocking fees 
after days from the date of purchase  the member may not receive a refund and is allowed an exchange only and may  if abuse of the return policy is found  have their membership terminated 
an independent associate is allowed to return an order within one year of the purchase date upon terminating their associate account 
if the product is returned unopened and in good salable condition  the independent associate may receive a full refund we may also allow the independent associate to receive a full refund for the first days following the product s purchase 
after days from the purchase date  the independent associate may not request a refund  and is allowed an exchange only  however  if abuse of the return policy is found  the independent associate may be terminated 
historically  sales returns estimates have not materially deviated from actual sales returns 
based upon our return policies  we estimate a sales return reserve for expected sales refunds based on our historical experience over a rolling six month period 
if actual results differ from our estimated sales returns reserves due to various factors  the amount of revenue recorded each period could be materially affected 
historically  our sales returns have not materially changed through the years as the majority of our customers return their merchandise within the first days after the original sale 
sales returns have averaged or less of our gross sales and for the year ended december  were composed of the following in thousands sales reserve as of december  current provision related to sales made in current provision related to sales made prior to actual returns or credits in related to actual returns or credits in related to prior periods sales reserve as of december  the satisfaction guarantee sales return policy for the first days following a product s purchase was implemented in august as a result of this change sales returns increased during the last part of the year 
we have increased our sales reserve at december   accordingly 
accounting for stock based compensation we grant stock options to our employees and board members 
at the date of grant  we determine the fair value of a stock option award and recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of such stock option award  which is two to four years 
the fair value of the stock option award is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  calculated fair value 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to apply judgment and use highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock option life  expected volatility  expected average risk free interest rates  and expected forfeiture rates 
for the year ended december   our assumptions and estimates used for the calculated fair value of stock options granted in were as follows average dividend yield between and  expected average risk free interest rate between and  expected market price volatility between and  expected forfeiture rate of  expected average life of stock options of years  
table of contents the calculated fair value of stock options granted of to per share  and the percentage of options calculated fair value compared to its exercise price of to 
historically  the estimates for our assumptions have not materially deviated from our actual reported results and rates 
however  the assumptions we use are based on our best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions that are outside of our control 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions we use  the stock based compensation expense reported in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of stock based compensation 
for example  if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures  we may be required to make an adjustment to our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
as of december   using our current assumptions and estimates  we anticipate recognizing million in gross compensation expense through related to unvested stock options outstanding 
if we grant additional stock options in the future  we would be required to recognize additional compensation expense over the vesting period of such stock options in our consolidated statement of operations 
gross compensation expense would equal the calculated fair value of such stock options  which is dependent on the assumptions used to calculate such fair value  but generally ranges between to of the exercise price multiplied by the number of stock options awarded 
as of december   we had  shares available for grant in the future 
contingencies and litigation each quarter  we evaluate the need to establish a reserve for any legal claims or assessments 
we base our evaluation on our best estimates of the potential liability in such matters 
the legal reserve includes an estimated amount for any damages and the probability of losing any threatened legal claims or assessments 
the legal reserve is developed in consultation with our general and outside counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
although we believe that our legal reserves and accruals are based on reasonable judgments and estimates  actual results could differ  which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods 
if actual results differ  if circumstances change  or if we experience an unanticipated adverse outcome of any legal action  including any claim or assessment  we would be required to recognize the estimated amount that could reduce net income  earnings per share  and cash flows

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments and do not purchase investments as hedges or for purposes other than trading that are likely to expose us to certain types of market risk  including interest rate  commodity price  or equity price risk 
although we have investments  we believe there has been no material change in our exposure to interest rate risk 
we have not issued any debt instruments  entered into any forward or futures contracts  purchased any options  or entered into any swap agreements 
we are exposed to other market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
because the change in value of the united states dollar measured against foreign currency may affect our consolidated financial results  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could positively or negatively affect our results as expressed in united states dollars 
for example  when the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies in which our products are sold or weakens against foreign currencies in which we may incur costs  our consolidated net sales and or related costs and expenses could be adversely affected 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our consolidated operations or profitability 
we expanded into canada in  into australia in  into the united kingdom in  into japan in  into new zealand in  into the republic of korea in  into taiwan and denmark in  and into germany in our united states operation services shipments to canada  while our australian operation services shipments to new zealand  and our united kingdom operation services shipments to denmark and germany 
we translate our revenues and expenses in foreign markets using either a current spot rate or weighted average rate 
we maintain policies  procedures  and internal processes in an effort to help monitor any significant market risks and we do not use any financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we assess the sensitivity of our earnings and cash flows to variability in currency exchange rates by applying an appropriate range of potential rate fluctuations to our assets  obligations  and projected transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we caution that we cannot predict with any certainty our future exposure to such currency exchange rate fluctuations or the impact  if any  such fluctuations may have on our future business  product pricing  operating expenses  and on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  to combat such market risk  we closely monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
the foreign currencies in which we currently have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk include the currencies of canada  australia  the united kingdom  japan  new zealand  the republic of korea  taiwan  denmark  and germany 
the current spot rate  weighted average currency exchange rates  and the low and high of such currency exchange rates as compared to the united states dollar  for each of these countries as of and for the year ended december  were as follows country foreign currency name low high weighted average spot australia dollar canada dollar denmark krone germany euro japan yen new zealand dollar republic of korea won taiwan dollar united kingdom british pound
