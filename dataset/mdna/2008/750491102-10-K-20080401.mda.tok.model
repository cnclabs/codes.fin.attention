item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate a group of regional networks comprised of diagnostic imaging facilities located in seven states with operations primarily in california  the mid atlantic  the treasure coast area of florida  kansas and the finger lakes rochester and hudson valley areas of new york  providing diagnostic imaging services including magnetic resonance imaging mri  computed tomography ct  positron emission tomography pet  nuclear medicine  mammography  ultrasound  diagnostic radiology  or x ray  and fluoroscopy 
the company s operations comprise a single segment for financial reporting purposes 
the results of operations of radiologix and its wholly owned subsidiaries have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition  november  the consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of radnet management  inc  or radnet management  and beverly radiology medical group iii brmg  which is a professional partnership  all collectively referred to as us or we

howard g 
berger  md is our president and chief executive officer  a member of our board of directors and owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
dr 
berger also owns  indirectly  of the equity interests in brmg 
brmg provides all of the professional medical services at of our facilities located in california under a management agreement with us  and contracts with various other independent physicians and physician groups to provide the professional medical services at most of our other california facilities 
we obtain professional medical services from brmg in california  rather than provide such services directly or through subsidiaries  in order to comply with california s prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine 
however  as a result of our close relationship with dr 
berger and brmg  we believe that we are able to better ensure that medical service is provided at our california facilities in a manner consistent with our needs and expectations and those of our referring physicians  patients and payors than if we obtained these services from unaffiliated physician groups 
at eight former radiologix centers in california and at all of the former radiologix centers which are located outside of california  we have entered into long term contracts with prominent radiology groups in the area to provide physician services at those facilities 
the operations of brmg are consolidated with us as a result of the contractual and operational relationship among brmg  dr 
berger  and us 
we are considered to have a controlling financial interest in brmg pursuant to the guidance in emerging issues task force issue eitf 
brmg is a partnership of pronet imaging medical group  inc and beverly radiology medical group  both of which are owned by dr 
berger 
radnet provides non medical  technical and administrative services to brmg for which it receives a management fee see brmg for a discussion of our management agreement with brmg 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  radiologix  we contract with radiology practices to provide professional services  including supervision and interpretation of diagnostic imaging procedures  in our non california diagnostic imaging centers and eight california centers 
the radiology practices maintain full control over the provision of professional radiological services 
the contracted radiology practices generally have outstanding physician and practice credentials and reputations  strong competitive market positions  a broad sub specialty mix of physicians  a history of growth and potential for continued growth 
in these facilities we enter into long term agreements with radiology practice groups typically years 
under these arrangements  in addition to obtaining technical fees for the use of our diagnostic imaging equipment and the provision of technical services  we provide management services and receive a fee based on the practice group s professional revenue  including revenue derived outside of our diagnostic imaging centers 
through radiologix we own the diagnostic imaging assets and  therefore  receive of the technical reimbursements associated with imaging procedures 
our radiologix subsidiary has no financial controlling interest in the contracted radiology practices  as defined in eitf  accordingly  we do not consolidate the financial statements of those practices in our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we had a working capital balance of million  million  and million at december   december   and october   respectively 
we had net losses of million  million   million  and million for the year ended december   the two months ended december  and  and the years ended october  and  respectively 
we also had a stockholders deficit of million  million  and million at december    and october   respectively 
we operate in a capital intensive  high fixed cost industry that requires significant amounts of capital to fund operations 
in addition to operations  we require significant amounts of capital for the initial start up and development expense of new diagnostic imaging facilities  the acquisition of additional facilities and new diagnostic imaging equipment  and to service our existing debt and contractual obligations 
because our cash flows from operations have been insufficient to fund all of these capital requirements  we have depended on the availability of financing under credit arrangements with third parties 
our business strategy with regard to operations focuses on the following x maximizing performance at our existing facilities  x focusing on profitable contracting  x expanding mri  ct and pet applications  x optimizing operating efficiencies  and x expanding our networks our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt and other contractual obligations will depend on our future financial performance 
a range of economic  competitive  regulatory  legislative and business factors  many of which are outside of our control  will affect our financial performance 
taking these factors into account  including our historical experience and our discussions with our lenders to date  although no assurance can be given  we believe that through implementing our strategic plans and continuing to restructure our financial obligations  we will obtain sufficient cash to satisfy our obligations as they become due in the next twelve months 
sources and uses of cash cash provided by operating activities was million   and million for the year ended december   the two months ended december  and the year ended october   respectively 
the primary reason for the increase in was due to consolidation of radiologix 
cash used by investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash used of million for the year ended october  for the year ended december   we purchased property and equipment for approximately million  acquired the assets and businesses of additional imaging facilities see facility acquisitions and divestiture below for approximately million  and increased our ownership interests in joint ventures that we initially acquired with radiologix 
we also generated cash of approximately million from the sale of imaging centers and a joint venture interest see facility acquisitions and divestitures below 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million and was primarily related to additional financing with ge commercial healthcare financial services  net of payments on notes and leases payable  and line of credit balances  as well as proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants of approximately  cash provided by financing activities for the year ended october  was million

adoption of the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
specifies how the carryover or reversal of prior year unrecorded financial statement misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
sab no 
requires an approach that considers the amount by which the current year consolidated statement of operations is misstated rollover approach and an approach that considers the cumulative amount by which the current year consolidated balance sheet is misstated iron curtain approach 
prior to the issuance of sab no 
 either the rollover or iron curtain approach was acceptable for assessing the materiality of financial statement misstatements 
prior to the company s application of the guidance in sab no 
 management used the rollover approach for quantifying financial statement misstatements 
initial application of sab no 
allows registrants to elect not to restate prior periods but to reflect the initial application in their annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  the cumulative effect of the initial application should be reported in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that fiscal year and the offsetting adjustment  net of tax  should be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that year 
we elected to record the effects of applying sab no 
using the cumulative effect transition method 
the misstatement that has been corrected is described below 
subsequent to the completion of the financial statement close process for the three and six months ended june   we determined that certain lease rate escalation clauses had not been properly accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the fiscal years ended october   and as well as for the two months ended december  our transition period and for the quarter ended march  the company had been recording rent expense based on the contractual terms of the lease agreements 
we reviewed statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
and its related interpretations including financial accounting standards board technical bulletin accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases ftb  scheduled rent increases and rent holidays in an operating lease should be recognized by the lessee on a straight line basis over the lease term unless another systematic and rational allocation is more representative of the time pattern in which leased property is physically employed 
ftb specifically states that scheduled rent increases designed to reflect the anticipated effects of inflation is not a justification to support not straight lining the lease cost over the lease term 
based on our review  we have concluded that the straight line method is required 
during the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december   we determined that we were under accrued for our obligations under our claims made medical malpractice insurance policy 
we determined that this accrual should have been on our balance sheet beginning in  and through december  the balance should have been million 
also  we concluded that we had overstated our restatement adjustment to our financial statements for the year ended october  as disclosed in our form k for the year ended october  related to the correction to the useful life of our leasehold improvements 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sab no 
 we recorded a million cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings with an offsetting amount of million to long term deferred rent and accrual liabilities  and an increase to fixed assets of million as of january  based on the nature of these adjustments and the totality of the circumstance surrounding these adjustments  we have concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality  and therefore  have elected  as permitted under the transition provisions of sab no 
 to reflect the effect of these adjustments in opening liabilities as of january   with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings as of january  critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including o our reported amounts of assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  o our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and o our reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could materially differ from these estimates 
the securities and exchange commission  or sec  defines critical accounting estimates as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
in note to our consolidated financial statements  we discuss our significant accounting policies  including those that do not require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
the most significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition our consolidated net revenue consists of net patient fee for service revenue and revenue from capitation arrangements  or capitation revenue 
net patient service revenue is recognized at the time services are provided net of contractual adjustments based on our evaluation of expected collections resulting from the analysis of current and past due accounts  past collection experience in relation to amounts billed and other relevant information 
contractual adjustments result from the differences between the rates charged for services performed and reimbursements by government sponsored healthcare programs and insurance companies for such services 
capitation revenue is recognized as revenue during the period in which we were obligated to provide services to plan enrollees under contracts with various health plans 
under these contracts  we receive a per enrollee amount each month covering all contracted services needed by the plan enrollees 
we re evaluated december  recorded receivable balances and concluded that current revised estimates are less than the prior year recorded amounts 
as a result  we have recorded adjustments in to appropriately reflect current estimates of december  recorded receivables which decreased net revenue by million 
information acquired during this evaluation will be utilized in our ongoing estimation of the net realizable value of accounts receivable 
accounts receivable substantially all of our accounts receivable are due under fee for service contracts from third party payors  such as insurance companies and government sponsored healthcare programs  or directly from patients 
services are generally provided pursuant to one year contracts with healthcare providers 
receivables generally are collected within industry norms for third party payors 
we continuously monitor collections from our clients and maintain an allowance for bad debts based upon specific payor collection issues that we have identified and our historical experience 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets we expense our long lived assets over their estimated economic useful lives with the exception of leasehold improvements where we use the shorter of the assets useful lives or the lease term of the facility for which these assets are associated 
deferred tax assets we evaluate the realizability of the net deferred tax assets and assess the valuation allowance periodically 
if future taxable income or other factors are not consistent with our expectations  an adjustment to our allowance for net deferred tax assets may be required 
even though we expect to utilize our net operating loss carry forwards in the future  the last three fiscal year losses and available evidence cause the valuation of our net deferred tax assets to be uncertain in the near term 
as of december   we have provided a full allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill at december  totaled million 
goodwill is recorded as a result of business combinations 
management evaluates goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach  which uses comparable market data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
using the services of an external valuation expert  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of october  based on our analysis  we recorded no impairment loss related to goodwill as of the year ended december  however  if estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets 
derivative financial instruments the company holds derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated transactions 
in general  the types of risks hedged are those relating to the variability of cash flows caused by movements in interest rates 
the company documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge  and  unless the instrument qualifies for the short cut method of hedge accounting  over the term of each hedging relationship 
our use of derivative financial instruments is limited to interest rate swaps  the purpose of which is to hedge the cash flows of variable rate indebtedness 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments are reported at fair value 
the gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge ie  change in fair value is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the company s consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
the remaining gain or loss  if any  is recognized currently in earnings 
amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into net income in the same period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
medical malpractice insurance we and our affiliated physicians are insured by fairway physicians insurance company 
fairway provides claims made malpractice insurance coverage that covers only asserted malpractice claims within policy limits 
with the assistance of actuarial advisors  we maintain an accrual for our exposure to incurred but not reported claims 
at december   this accrual was million 
the accrual is based on an estimate of the ultimate amount of claims we expect to pay which have not been reported at december  significant events radiologix on november   we completed our acquisition of radiologix  inc as a stock purchase 
under the terms of the merger agreement  radiologix shareholders received aggregate consideration of  shares of our common stock and  in cash 
in thousands value of stock given by radnet to radiologix  cash  transaction fees and expenses  total purchase price  calculated as  shares multiplied by average closing price of from june  to july  
includes  in assumed liabilities of radiologix  including  in merger and acquisition fees and  in radiologix bond prepayment penalties 
under the purchase method of accounting  the total purchase price as shown above is allocated to radiologix s net tangible and intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of acquisition 
the following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation at the date of acquisition 
in thousands current assets  property and equipment  net  identifiable intangible assets  goodwill  investments in joint ventures  other assets current liabilities  accrued restructuring charges contracts  assumption of debt  long term liabilities  minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  total purchase price  cash  marketable securities  investments and other assets we valued cash  marketable securities  investments and other assets at their respective carrying amounts as we believe that these amounts approximated their current fair values 
identifiable intangible assets identifiable intangible assets acquired include management service agreements and covenants not to compete 
management service agreements represent the underlying relationships and agreements with certain professional radiology groups 
covenants not to compete are contracts entered into with certain former members of management of radiologix on the date of acquisition 
identifiable intangible assets consist of estimated estimated amortization annual in thousands fair value period amortization management service agreements  years  covenants not to compete  to years  estimated useful lives for the intangible assets were based on the average contract terms  which are greater than the amortization period that will be used for management contracts 
intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method  considering the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed 
goodwill  has been allocated to goodwill 
this is an increase of approximately million from our previous estimate 
the increase in goodwill relates to an million decrease to property and equipment  a  increase to current assets  a  increase to deferred taxes and a million increase to accrued liabilities 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually 
we performed this test on october  as a result of this test  management determined that the value of goodwill is not impaired 
because this goodwill was established through a stock purchase  no amount is deductible for tax purposes 
operating leases we assumed certain operating leases for both equipment and facilities 
all related historical deferred rent liabilities have been eliminated

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we sell our services exclusively in the united states and receive payment for our services exclusively in united states dollars 
as a result  our financial results are unlikely to be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
a large portion of our interest expense is not sensitive to changes in the general level of interest in the united states because the majority of our indebtedness has interest rates that were fixed when we entered into the note payable or capital lease obligation

this facility was used to finance our acquisition of radiologix  refinance existing indebtedness  pay transaction costs and expenses relating to our acquisition of radiologix  and to provide financing for working capital needs post acquisition 
the facility consists of a revolving credit facility of up to million  a million term loan and a million second lien term loan 
the revolving credit facility has a term of five years  the term loan has a term of six years and the second lien term loan has a term of six and one half years

the index rate is initially a floating rate equal to the higher of the rate quoted from time to time by the wall street journal as the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least of the nation s largest banks or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
the applicable index margin on each the revolving credit facility and the term loan is and on the second lien term loan is 
we may request that the interest rate instead be based on libor plus the applicable libor margin  which is for the revolving credit facility and the term loan and for the second lien term loan 
the credit facility includes customary covenants for a facility of this type  including minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  maximum total leverage ratio  maximum senior leverage ratio  limitations on indebtedness  contingent obligations  liens  capital expenditures  lease obligations  mergers and acquisitions  asset sales  dividends and distributions  redemption or repurchase of equity interests  subordinated debt payments and modifications  loans and investments  transactions with affiliates  changes of control  and payment of consulting and management fees

as part of the transaction  partly due to the drop in libor of over since the credit facilities were established in november  we increased the applicable libor margin to for the revolving credit facility and the term loan and for the second lien term loan 
the additions to radnet s existing credit facilities are intended to provide capital for near term opportunities and future expansion 
as part of the financing  we were required to swap at least of the aggregate principal amount of the facilities to a floating rate within days of the close of the agreement on november  on april   effective april   we entered into an interest rate swap on million fixing the libor rate of interest at for a period of three years
