the increase in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to increased salaries related to increases in compensation and headcount and increased recruiting costs related to new hires  which were offset by reductions in consulting and prototype parts costs 
software development costs totaling   and  were capitalized during fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases in capitalized software costs in fiscal compared to fiscal were related to completed projects 
the increase in capitalized software costs in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to increased expenditures related to mpeg h 
products 
research and development expenses  excluding capitalized software development costs  were  or of revenues in fiscal   or of revenues in fiscal  and  or of revenues in fiscal we expect research and development expenditures to decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal due to completed projects 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of selected patents and patent applications to epax consulting limited liability company for net proceeds of approximately  and recorded a gain of  the group of patents and patent applications sold relate to product distinction  system architecture and ip networking 
we retained a worldwide  non exclusive  royalty free license under the patents for use in both existing and future products 
interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an increase in average line of credit borrowings 
we believe that interest expense in fiscal will increase compared to fiscal as a result of expected increases in average line of credit borrowings  as well as potential increases in our loan interest rate  as further discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section 
interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal interest income in fiscal included a one time benefit of  from interest paid on the collection of adelphia communications receivables 
no income tax expense was recorded for fiscal  due to utilization of net operating loss and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
in fiscal  the deferred tax asset decreased  which was offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance by the same amount 
no income tax benefits were recorded in fiscal and due to an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of  and  respectively 
at august   net deferred tax assets of  were fully reserved by a valuation allowance 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered in judging the likelihood of realizing tax benefits 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
cumulative losses are one of the most difficult pieces of negative evidence to overcome in the absence of sufficient existing orders and backlog versus forecasted future orders supporting a return to profitability 
additional orders and backlog are currently needed for profitability in fiscal our assessment in applying sfas no 
indicated that a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets was required as of august  and august  at august   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of  of which  expires in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal additionally  we had an alternative minimum tax credit of  and a state income tax credit of  expiring in fiscal  all of which were fully offset by the valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources at august   our net inventory balances increased  to  from  at august  the increase in inventories was primarily due to our new fiscal product introductions of the ipump enterprise media server  the unity receiver and the encompass le audio receiver

at august   outstanding inventory purchase commitments amounted to  these inventory purchases and purchase commitments were made based on existing orders and expected future bookings 
our fiscal bookings were below our expectations  particularly during the fourth quarter of fiscal  primarily as a result of customer delays in purchasing decisions  deferral of project expenditures  foreign exchange rate fluctuations and adverse economic conditions 
wci s backlog of orders scheduled to ship within months was  at august    at august   and  at september  the total multi year backlog at august  was  compared to  at august  approximately  of the august   backlog is expected to ship during fiscal significant fiscal shippable bookings are currently required to meet our financial projections beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and continuing for each subsequent quarter 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and subsequent to august   we made reductions in headcount to bring the current number of employees to  and reduced engineering consulting and other overhead expenses 
should adequate capital or financing not be available  and if increased revenues not materialize  we are committed to further reducing operating costs to bring them in line with reduced revenue levels 
no assurances can be given that operating costs can be sufficiently reduced to allow us to continue as a going concern 
through november  bookings and revenues to date were insufficient to provide adequate levels of cash flow from operations or adequate levels of collateral to support required borrowings during the second quarter of fiscal as a result  we need to raise additional capital or obtain additional credit facilities during the second quarter of fiscal to continue as a going concern and to execute our business plan 
although we are in discussions with potential financing sources  there is no assurance that such financing will be available or that we will be able to complete financing on satisfactory terms  if at all 
our ability to continue as a going concern will depend upon our ability to obtain additional capital or financing in the very short term and to subsequently increase our bookings and revenues in the longer term to attain profitable operations 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the company to continue as a going concern

at august   our net inventory balances increased  to  from  at august  the increase in inventories was primarily due to our new fiscal product introductions of the ipump enterprise media server  the unity receiver and the encompass le audio receiver 
in addition  inventory levels were increased for the ipump media server and nielsen media research products 
these inventory purchases require sufficient lead times with our offshore manufacturers and which require estimates of expected future bookings 
our fiscal bookings were below our expectations which resulted in higher than expected inventories at august  while no assurances may be given  we believe inventory levels will decrease during fiscal during fiscal  there were no increases to the inventory reserve provision 
inventory reserves were increased by provisions charged to cost of sales of  in fiscal and  in fiscal inventory reserves were decreased by write offs of  in fiscal and none in fiscal and increases in inventories in fiscal used  of cash

critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most subjective or difficult judgments 
these policies are as follows revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement with the customer exists  products are shipped or title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the customer  the amount due from the customer is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and there are no significant future performance obligations 
service revenues are recognized at the time of performance 
revenues from separate extended service maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements  which is typically one year 
the unrecognized revenue portion of maintenance contracts invoiced and the fair value of future performance obligations are recorded as deferred revenue 
in addition  any invoices generated in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
at august   deferred extended service maintenance revenues were  and deferred revenues related to future performance obligations were  and are expected to be recognized as revenue in varying amounts throughout fiscal we recognize revenue in certain circumstances before delivery has occurred commonly referred to as bill and hold transactions 
in such circumstances  among other things  risk of ownership has passed to the buyer  the buyer has made a written fixed commitment to purchase the finished goods  the buyer has requested the finished goods be held for future delivery as scheduled and designated by them  and no additional performance obligations exist by us 
for these transactions  the finished goods are segregated from inventory and normal billing and credit terms are granted 
for the year ended august   revenues attributable to one customer in the amount of  were recorded prior to delivery as bill and hold transactions 
at august   accounts receivable for these revenues were paid in full 
these policies require management  at the time of the transaction  to assess whether the amounts due are fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and no future performance obligations exist 
these assessments are based on the terms of the agreement with the customer  past history and creditworthiness of the customer 
if management determines that collection is not reasonably assured or future performance obligations exist  revenue recognition is deferred until these conditions are satisfied 
our principal sources of revenues are from the sales of various satellite communications equipment 
embedded in our products is internally developed software of varying applications 
we evaluate our products to assess whether software is more than incidental to a product 
when we conclude that software is more than incidental to a product  we will account for the product as a software product 
revenue on software products and software related elements is recognized in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition as amended by sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
significant judgment may be required in determining whether a product is a software or hardware product 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost at standard  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
inventories include the cost of raw materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we make inventory reserve provisions to properly reflect inventory value based on a review of inventory quantities on hand  sales forecasts  new products being developed and technology changes 
these reserves are to provide for items that are potentially slow moving  excess or obsolete 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand and rapidly changing technology could result in additional obsolete and slow moving inventory that is unsaleable or saleable at reduced prices  which could require additional inventory reserve provisions 
at august   inventories  net of reserve provisions of approximately  amounted to  capitalized software costs software development costs are capitalized subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
capitalized costs are amortized based on the larger of the amounts computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for each product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
expected future revenues and estimated economic lives are subject to revisions due to market conditions  technology changes and other factors resulting in shortfalls of expected revenues or reduced economic lives  which could result in additional amortization expense or write offs 
at august   capitalized software costs  net of accumulated amortization  amounted to  deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards  if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss and credit carryforwards 
the valuation allowance decreased  in fiscal  and increased  in fiscal and  in fiscal at august   net deferred tax assets of  were fully reserved by a valuation allowance 
accounts receivable valuation we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments
