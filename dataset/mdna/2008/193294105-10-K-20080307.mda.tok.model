the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
sales returns and allowances the company s ability to collect factor chargebacks for deductions taken by its customers for returns  discounts and allowances as well as potential future customer deductions is significant to its operations 
the company reserves against known chargebacks as well as potential future customer deductions based on a combination of historical activity and current market conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which may have a significant impact on the company s results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments  as well as royalties and advertising revenues from its licensing partners 
these customers include non factored accounts and credit card receivables from third party service providers 
if the financial conditions of these customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets and long lived assets the company performs a review of its indefinite lived intangible assets and long lived assets for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset 
income taxes the company s income taxes are routinely under audit by federal  state or local authorities 
these audits include questioning of the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
based on its annual evaluations of tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent the company is required to pay amounts in excess of recorded income tax liabilities  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially impacted 
the company adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin on january  which requires financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a return 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
litigation the company is periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management is required to assess the probability of any adverse judgments as well as the potential range of any losses 
management determines the required accruals after a careful review of the facts of each significant legal action 
the company s accruals may change in the future due to new developments in these matters 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in and subject to compliance and regulatory reviews and audits by numerous authorities  agencies and other governmental agents and entities from various jurisdictions 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes of these matters 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these reviews is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or final resolution in each matter  which may have a significant impact on the company s results 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
r share based payment sfas r which requires all share based payments  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the company elected to use the modified prospective transition method to record stock based compensation expense  therefore  prior period results were not restated 
under sfas r  the company measures the cost of services received in exchange for stock options and similar awards based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognizes this cost in the income statement over the period during which an award recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
the company uses the black scholes model to assess the fair value of share based payments and amortizes this cost over the service period 
in addition  stock compensation expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures prior to vesting primarily based on historical annual forfeiture rates and by employee classification 
estimated forfeitures are reassessed on a quarterly basis and may change based on new facts and circumstances 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles

sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis

if a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item  changes in that item s fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current period earnings 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to draw comparison between entities that elect different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities 
the company adopted the provisions on january   and has determined that it will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date  with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was due to decreases in the company s wholesale and consumer direct business segments  partially offset by slight increases in the company s licensing business 
wholesale net sales excluding sales to the company s consumer direct business segment decreased million  or to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to a decline in sales across the company s branded businesses

net sales in the company s consumer direct segment decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease primarily related to a decrease in full priced retail and company store sales of million  or  offset by increased internet sales of million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to december  comparable store sales decreased million  or  while new store sales in plus that portion of sales for stores not open for all of decreased million

royalty revenue increased million or to million in from million in the increase in licensing revenues was primarily attributable to incremental revenues from its existing licensees offset by a reduction in sportswear royalties from an amendment to the company s licensing agreement relating to its kenneth cole reaction men s and kenneth cole new york sportswear businesses 
the company has transitioned its kenneth cole new york and kenneth cole reaction men s sportswear businesses from a licensing model to an in house operation  and has commenced shipments for the spring season 
consolidated gross profit  as a percentage of net revenues  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in consumer direct margins  as well as a change in mix of the company s net revenues from its wholesale  consumer direct and licensing segments 
the consumer direct segment  which operates at a higher gross profit level than the wholesale segment  had increased revenues as a percentage of net revenues of for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   while the wholesale segment revenues as a percentage of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the revenues in the licensing segment  which carries no cost of goods sold  increased as a percentage of net revenues to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  in addition  wholesale margins decreased from softer sell thrus in a challenging retail environment  while retail margins improved from reduced markdowns from modified price points to align the price value relationship of the company s brands 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  including warehousing and receiving expenses  increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in sg a expenses was primarily attributable to increases in stock based compensation expense  costs incurred with transitioning the men s sportswear business to an in house operation  costs associated with the implementation of the company s sap retail and point of sale systems and legal reserves 
as a percentage of net revenues  sg a expenses increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  from the additional costs mentioned above and loss of leverage on the decrease in wholesale sales 
the company incurred an impairment on long lived assets of million during the year ended december  compared to million in the increase in charges in primarily related to the impairment in of certain leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures in twenty three of the company s stores 
interest and other income increased million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an average higher rate of return on investments 
the company s effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this was primarily due to a million tax benefit and a decrease in the related level of earnings in the various state and local taxing jurisdictions to which the company s earnings are subject during the year ended december  as compared to december  in  the company recorded million of net tax benefits for agreements reached with certain tax jurisdictions that closed outstanding audit periods for which the company had previously established reserves 
as a result of the foregoing  net income decreased by million or to million of net revenues for the year ended december  from million of net revenues for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was due to revenue increases in the company s wholesale and licensing business segments  partially offset by decreases in the company s consumer direct business 
wholesale net sales excluding sales to the consumer direct business segment increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to a growth in sales of kenneth cole reaction footwear and handbags of approximately  as well as single digit growth in bongo  tribeca  and unlisted footwear  offset by declines in kenneth cole new york handbags 
the company will continue to focus on product offerings  design  pricing and distribution  which it believes are the significant factors defining its brands and increasing consumer demand 
net sales in the company s consumer direct segment decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in retail store sales of million  or  as compared to year ended december  comparable store sales decreased by million  or  offset by an increase of million of new store sales in plus the portion of sales for stores not open for all of comparable stores are defined as new stores that are open for longer than thirteen months 
a store that stops operations is included in the comparable sales calculation through the date of closing 
the company believes that the lack of an effective execution of its brand elevation strategy for the company s retail stores contributed significantly to the decline in consumer direct results 
the company believes it may have elevated its prices too abruptly to create an appropriate transition for its customers 
the company is taking measures to address these issues  including certain organizational and management changes  as well as merchandising improvements 
the company has separated the merchandising and support functions between the company s company stores and its full priced retail stores 
as a result  the company believes it can initiate more effective business and merchandising practices for these stores 
the initial stage of the company s plan has been to eliminate the use of its company stores as clearance centers and increase the amount of specific made for company store product 
this has improved the company s presentation  margins  and resulted in positive company store comparative store sales in the fourth quarter of of 
in addition  the company is controlling inventory levels to reduce clearance product  is adjusting product mix to incorporate a wider range of price points  and is evaluating its real estate portfolio with plans to close several stores  while reviewing opportunities for new store locations for the latter half of royalty revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the incremental minimum royalties from the company s existing licensees  as well as additional royalties from two reaction licensees related to women s sportswear and the home collection  offset by declines in domestic royalty revenue from men s and women s kenneth cole new york sportswear 
the company believes sportswear is a critical component in the visibility of its brands in both its consumer direct and wholesale business segments 
in november  the company amended its license agreement with paul davril inc pdi  which covers the manufacture and distribution of men s and women s sportswear under the kenneth cole new york trademark and men s sportswear under the kenneth cole reaction trademark 
the amended agreement results in the company assuming control of its kenneth cole new york and kenneth cole reaction sportswear categories at the end of the company is transitioning the kenneth cole new york women s sportswear business  some of which the company has already been sourcing over the past two seasons and plans to assume control of the kenneth cole new york men s sportswear business during as the company absorbs the infrastructure and makes this transition  it will make a determination as to the strategic alternatives of kenneth cole reaction men s sportswear  which include entering into a strategic licensing arrangement or similar venture with a new partner or partners or assuming internal control of the business 
the company believes that taking control of the kenneth cole new york men s and women s sportswear business by the end of will result in the reduction of licensing revenue along with reduced advertising contributions and some additional infrastructure costs in the short term  but will have meaningful long term benefits 
the company believes that controlling the kenneth cole new york sportswear classification will allow it to better reinforce each of its brands and all of the associated businesses  most particularly the consumer direct business 
the amendment of the pdi license is expected to cause a reduction in licensing royalties of approximately million to million before considering any growth in other licenses 
in addition  incremental advertising and infrastructure costs of approximately million to million are expected before implementing any mitigating actions 
consolidated gross profit decreased to in  as a percentage of net revenues  compared to in this decrease was primarily a result of decreases in the consumer direct margins  offset by an increase in wholesale margins  and the change in mix of the company s net revenues from its three segments 
the consumer direct segment  which typically operates at a higher gross profit level than the wholesale segment  had decreased revenues as a percentage of net revenues of for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   while the wholesale segment revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the revenues in the licensing segment  which carries no cost of goods sold  also decreased as a percentage of revenue to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in wholesale margins is primarily due to strong sell thrus at retail of kenneth cole reaction branded product  while the margins in consumer direct decreased due to additional clearance activity  during the first three quarters of sg a expenses  including warehousing and receiving expenses  decreased as a percentage of net revenues to million in  which included impairment charges of approximately million  from of net revenues million in  which included severance costs of approximately million in stock based compensation expense amounted to million and is included in sg a expenses 
excluding the impact of stock based compensation expense  sg a expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  would have been for the year ended december   as compared to in expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased primarily due to leverage from the company s improvement in sales from its wholesale segment  including efficiencies gained by moving to a new west coast distribution center in march  offset by fixed costs de leveraging on its consumer direct segment s negative comparative stores sales base results 
interest and other income increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase was primarily due to higher average cash balances and a higher rate of return on investments 
the company s effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of a temporary provision that allowed us companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate in  which resulted in approximately million in tax savings for the year ended december  this was offset by a tax benefit during of approximately  net of certain tax liabilities that were established  resulting from agreements reached with various taxing authorities that closed certain outstanding audit periods  for which the company had previously established reserves 
as a result of the foregoing  net income decreased by million  or  to million of net revenue  for the year ended december   from million of net revenue for the year ended december  related party transactions the company has an exclusive license agreement with iconix brand group  inc  and its trademark holding company  ip holdings  llc iconix  to use the bongo trademark in connection with worldwide manufacture  sale and distribution of women s  men s and children s footwear 
the chief executive officer and chairman of iconix is the brother of the company s chief executive officer and chairman 
the term of the agreement is through december  management believes that the license agreement with iconix was entered into at arm s length 
during these periods  the company is obligated to pay iconix a percentage of net sales based upon the terms of the agreement

management believes that all transactions were made on terms and conditions similar to or more favorable than those available in the marketplace from unrelated parties 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash requirements are generated primarily from working capital needs  retail expansion  new technology  and other corporate activities 
the company primarily relies upon internally generated cash flows from operations to finance its operations and growth  however  it also has the ability to borrow up to million under its revolving credit facility 
cash flows may vary from time to time as a result of seasonal requirements of inventory  the timing of the delivery of merchandise to customers and the level of accounts receivable and payable balances 
at december   working capital was million compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash flows provided by operations is primarily attributable to a decrease in net income and the timing of accounts receivable and accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million provided by investing activities for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to million in proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities in connection with the shift in the company s portfolio holdings of auction rate securities to overnight money market funds  compared to proceeds of million of marketable securities in in addition  approximately million was used to purchase the le tigre trademark and other intellectual property associated with the le tigre brand during this was partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures for the year ended december  of million  compared to million for the year ended december   which includes the purchase of the company s corporate headquarters building for approximately million in also included in capital expenditures for the years ended december  and  were approximately million and  respectively  for amounts associated with the implementation of the sap retail and point of sales systems and furniture  fixtures  and leasehold improvements for the buildout of new company stores 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the company s repurchase of  treasury shares at an aggregate price of million during as compared to  treasury shares repurchased at an aggregate price of million during this was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and the repayment of the company s short term borrowing of million in the company currently sells substantially all of its accounts receivable to two factors without recourse 
in circumstances where a customer s account cannot be factored without recourse  the company may take other measures to reduce its credit exposure  which could include requiring the customer to pay in advance  or to provide a letter of credit covering the sales price of the merchandise ordered 
the company s material obligations under contractual agreements  primarily commitments for future payments under operating lease agreements  as of december  are summarized as follows payment due by period total year or less years years after years operating leases and other obligations purchase obligations minimum licensee royalties total contractual obligations during  the company anticipates that it will continue to require additional capital expenditures to support its information systems 
the company implemented an integrated business platform using sap software across the company s full priced retail and company stores  which resulted in capital expenditures of approximately million 
contingent rent and other charges amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and in december  the company entered into a five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  with various lenders  which provides up to million to finance working capital requirements and letters of credit to finance the company s inventory purchases 
a portion of the revolving credit facility not in excess of million shall be available for the issuance of standby letters of credit 
the full amount of the revolving credit facility will be available for the issuance of commercial letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility requires  among other things  that the company comply with a maximum leverage ratio and various covenants on indebtedness  dissolutions  mergers  asset sales  pledges and changes in its lines of business  as defined 
failure by the company to comply with these covenants could reduce the borrowings available under the revolving credit facility 
if an event of default occurs  borrowings and interest are payable immediately  unless cured as defined  allowing borrowings to continue during the cure period 
loans under the revolving credit facility bear an interest rate equal to the alternative base rate defined as the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus or the adjusted libor rate plus applicable margin as defined within the agreement  as elected by the company 
the company incurs facility fees of ten basis points on the face amount of the revolving credit facility 
during  the company incurred facility fees of approximately  there were no outstanding advances under this agreement at december   and amounts available under the revolving credit facility at december  were reduced by  of standby and open letters of credit 
during  the company did not borrow under the revolving credit facility 
in  the company repaid a million promissory note  which one of the company s foreign subsidiaries entered into with a financial institution in connection with the company s tax repatriation plan 
the company believes that it will be able to satisfy its current expected cash requirements for  including requirements for its in house sportswear infrastructure  enhanced information systems and the payments of its quarterly cash dividend  primarily with cash flow from operations and cash on hand 
off balance sheet arrangements the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  exchange rates the company sometimes enters into forward exchange contracts for its future purchases of inventory denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
gains and losses on forward exchange contracts that are used for hedges are accounted for on the company s consolidated balance sheet as inventory and an adjustment to equity  and are subsequently accounted for as part of the purchase price of the inventory upon execution of the contract 
at december   the company had no unrealized gains or losses as no forward contracts were outstanding 
unrealized gains and losses are typically included in other comprehensive income in the company s statement of changes in shareholders equity and as an adjustment to inventory  which is the underlying exposure on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
while the company believes that its current procedures with respect to the reduction of risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations are adequate  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company in the future 
inventory from contract manufacturers in asia and brazil are purchased in united states dollars and the recent fluctuations of many of these currencies against the united states dollar has not had any material adverse impact on the company 
however  future purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturer  which may affect the company s cost of goods in the future 
the company currently does not believe the potential effects of such fluctuations would have a material adverse effect on the company 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that the relatively low rates of inflation experienced over the last few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s marketable securities consist of triple a rated debt obligations and substantially all have insurers 
recently  several auctions have failed as a result of illiquidity and imbalance in order flow for auction rate securities 
a failed auction is not an indication of an increased credit risk or a reduction in the underlying collateral  however  parties wishing to sell securities could not do so 
based on current market conditions  it is not known when or if the capital markets will come back into balance to achieve successful auctions for these securities 
if these auctions continue to fail  it could result in the company holding securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates and will limit the liquidity of these investments 
based on the company s expected operating cash flows  and other sources and uses of cash  the company does not anticipate that the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect its ability to execute its current business plan 
the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risks with respect to its inventory transactions denominated in euro 
business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net dollar cash flows from transactions with foreign suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency rates 
the company manages these risks by utilizing foreign exchange contracts 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   the company had no forward contracts outstanding 
the company s earnings may also be affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under its credit facilities 
a two or less percentage point increase in interest rates affecting the company s credit facilities would not have had a material effect on the company s and net income 
the company sources a significant amount of product from china and will be subject to foreign currency exposure to its us dollar denominated transactions if the chinese yuan is allowed to float freely on the open market 
if the yuan is allowed to float freely against other foreign currency  a two percent change in exchange rates could have a material effect on the cost of future inventory purchases to be transacted by the company
