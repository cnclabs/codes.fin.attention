overview we are a market focused company primarily engaged in the design  manufacture  sales and service of high technology digital imaging solutions to the graphic arts industry worldwide 
we are helping to lead the industry s transformation from analog print production methods to digital imaging technology 
we are a leader in the development of advanced printing systems using digital imaging equipment and consumables based solutions that economically benefit the user through a streamlined workflow and chemistry free  environmentally responsible operation 
we are also a leading sales and service channel in the small to mid sized commercial  quick and in plant printing markets offering a wide range of solutions to over  customers worldwide 
presstek s business model is a capital equipment and consumables razor and blade model 
in this model  approximately of our revenue is recurring revenue 
our model is designed so that each placement of either a direct imaging press or a computer to plate system results in recurring aftermarket revenue for consumables and service 
through our various operations  we provide advanced print solutions through the development and manufacture of digital laser imaging equipment and advanced technology chemistry free printing plates  which we call consumables  for commercial and in plant print providers targeting the growing market for high quality  fast turnaround short run color printing  are a leading sales and services company delivering presstek digital solutions and solutions from other manufacturing partners through our direct sales and service force and through distribution partners worldwide  manufacture semiconductor solid state laser diodes for presstek imaging applications and for use in external applications  and distribute printing plates for conventional print applications  as well as related equipment and supplies for the graphic arts and printing industries 
we have developed a proprietary system by which digital images are transferred onto printing plates for direct imaging on press applications and for computer to plate applications 
we refer to direct imaging as di and computer to plate as ctp 
our digital imaging systems enable customers to produce high quality  full color lithographic printed materials more quickly and cost effectively than conventional methods that employ more complicated workflows and toxic chemical processing 
this results in reduced printing cycle time and lowers the effective cost of production for commercial printers 
our solutions make it more cost effective for printers to meet the increasing demand for shorter print runs  higher quality color and faster turn around times 
our groundbreaking di technology is used in our ctp systems 
our presstek business segment designs and manufactures ctp systems that incorporate our imaging technology and image our chemistry free printing plates 
in addition to marketing  selling and servicing our proprietary digital products  we also market  sell and service traditional  or analog products for the commercial print market 
this analog equipment is manufactured by third party strategic partners and analog consumables are manufactured by our various partners 
lasertel  inc  a subsidiary of presstek  is primarily engaged in the manufacture and development of high powered laser diodes for presstek and for sale to external customers 
lasertel s products include semiconductor lasers and active components for the graphics  defense  industrial  and medical industries 
lasertel offers high powered laser diodes in both standard and customized configurations  including chip on sub mount  un mounted bars  and fiber coupled devices  to support various applications 
our operations are organized based on the market application of our products and related services and consist of two reportable segments presstek and lasertel 
the presstek segment is primarily engaged in the development  manufacture  sale and servicing of our patented digital imaging systems and patented printing plate technologies as well as traditional  analog systems and related equipment and supplies for the graphic arts and printing industries  primarily the short run  full color market segment 
the lasertel segment manufactures and develops high powered laser diodes for presstek and for sale to external customers 
we generate revenue through four main sources i the sale of our equipment  including di presses and ctp devices  as well as imaging kits  which are incorporated by leading press manufacturers into direct imaging presses for the graphic arts industry  ii the sale of high powered laser diodes for the graphic arts  defense  medical and industrial sectors  iii the sale of our proprietary and non proprietary consumables and supplies  and iv the servicing of offset printing systems and analog and ctp systems and related equipment 
our business strategy is centered on maximizing the sale of consumable products  such as printing plates  and therefore our business efforts focus on the sale of consumable burning engines such as our di presses and ctp devices 
our strategy to grow our consumables has two parts 
the first part is to increase the number of our di and ctp units in the field 
by increasing the number of consumable burning engines we expect to increase the demand for our consumables 
we rely on partnerships with press manufacturers such as ryobi limited  heidelberger druckmaschinen ag  or heidelberg  and koenig bower ag  or kba  to market printing presses and press solutions that use our proprietary consumables 
we also rely on distribution partners  such as eastman kodak  to sell related proprietary consumable products 
another method of growing the market for consumables is to develop consumables that can be imaged by non presstek devices 
in addition to expanding our base of our consumable burning engines  an element of our focus is to reach beyond our proprietary systems and penetrate the installed base of ctp devices in all market segments with our chemistry free and process free offerings 
the first step in executing this strategy was the launch of our non proprietary aurora chemistry free printing plate designed to be used with consumable burning engines manufactured by thermal ctp market leaders screen and kodak 
we continue to work with other ctp manufacturers to qualify our consumables on their systems 
we believe this shift in strategy fundamentally enhances our ability to expand and control our business 
we operate and report on a or week  fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december accordingly  the consolidated financial statements include the financial reports for the week fiscal year ended december   which we refer to as fiscal  the week fiscal year ended december   which we refer to as fiscal  and the week fiscal year ended december   which we refer to as fiscal 
we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is presented together with results of operations by business segment 
results of operations results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of revenue were as follows in thousands of dollars fiscal year ended december  december  december  of revenue of revenue of revenue revenue product service and parts total revenue cost of revenue product service and parts total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales  marketing and customer support general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring and other charges total operating expenses operating income loss interest and other expense  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal revenue consolidated revenues were million in  a decrease of million  or  from million in equipment revenues reflected a decrease of million  or  compared to  as strong sales of di presses and increases in our lasertel business were not enough to offset significant declines in our analog and ctp product lines  particularly lower sales of dpm machines 
consumables revenues declined by million  or  due primarily to lower sales of qmdi plates 
revenues in our service business were lower by million  or  in due to lower contract service revenues resulting from the transition of our customer base from analog to digital solutions 
overall  sales of presstek s growth portfolio of products  defined as di and di digital offset solutions  the presstek family of chemistry free ctp solutions  and lasertel  increased million  or  from million in to million in presstek segment equipment revenues were million in vs 
million in  a decrease of million  or 
gross sales of presstek s growth portfolio of equipment increased to million in from million in revenues from the sale of di equipment in of million reflects an increase of million  or  vs 
due to strong marketplace demand for the di press  which was first introduced in the third quarter of total unit sales of the di press reached in  and di revenues as a percentage of total di press revenue increased from in to in sales of our remaining growth portfolio of equipment  presstek ctp platesetters and vector tx machines  declined from million in to million in  a decrease of  due in part to the company s continued emphasis on marketing higher margin di presses  as well as a large decline in the sale of dpm machines consistent with industry trends 
in addition  unit sales of the vector tx were negatively impacted early in from the carry over impact of quality issues experienced during the second half of these issues have since been successfully resolved 
equipment sales of our traditional line of products  defined as qmdi presses  polyester ctp platesetters  and conventional equipment  were all lower in compared to due to the ongoing transition of our customer base from analog to digital technologies 
gross revenues from our traditional equipment products decreased from million in to million in  a decline of 
as a percentage of total equipment revenue within the presstek segment  net sales of growth portfolio products increased from of revenue in to of revenue in revenue for the lasertel segment  including intercompany revenue  was million in  and reflects an increase of million  or  compared to the favorable increase in is principally the result of additional sales of laser diode array products to external customers  which more than offset lower sales to the presstek segment 
consumables product revenues decreased from million in to million in  a reduction of million  or 
the decline in revenues resulted from the anticipated slowdown of certain products in presstek s traditional line  including qmdi plates and conventional consumables  and was consistent with industry trends 
qmdi plates declined from million in to million in  a decrease of 
sales of conventional consumables declined from million in fiscal to million in the comparable period 
partially offsetting this decline were sales of presstek s growth portfolio of consumables  defined as di  di  and chemistry free ctp plates  which grew from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
service and parts revenues declined from million in to million in  a decrease of 
lower revenues resulted primarily from the anticipated shift away from our less profitable legacy service contract base which  in the short term  is declining faster than our digital service business is accelerating 
cost of revenue consolidated cost of revenue was million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  compared to fiscal product cost of revenue in includes million of charges related to excess and obsolete inventory  warranty  and accrued purchase commitments related to product portfolio changes  planned changes for the vector tx product line  physical inventory results  and other adjustments 
service and parts cost of revenue in fiscal includes a charge of million related to write downs of field service parts inventory 
cost of product  consisting of costs of material  labor and overhead  shipping and handling costs and warranty expenses  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cost of product in the presstek segment was million in fiscal compared to million in the same prior year period 
in  the company recorded inventory related charges of million  consisting of million for the write off of excess and obsolete inventory  million of inventory write downs related to the vector tx  million of warranty related expenses  and other adjustments 
offsetting these costs were lower costs related to favorable equipment product mix  production efficiencies in our plate manufacturing processes  and lower freight costs 
cost of revenue in the lasertel segment  including intercompany  was million in fiscal compared to million in the comparable prior year period 
in fiscal  the company recorded excess and obsolete inventory charges of million  and million related to physical inventory losses 
cost of service in  including the previously discussed million write down of field service parts inventory  was million compared to million same prior year period 
these amounts represent the costs of spare parts  labor and overhead associated with the ongoing service of products 
service costs were favorably impacted by the improved utilization of the field service organization in north america  the result of a restructuring plan intended to realign our service organization with a declining analog revenue base 
gross profit consolidated gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was in compared to in gross margins were negatively impacted in by excess and obsolete inventory and warranty charges related to product portfolio changes and field service parts inventory changes 
gross profit as a percentage of product revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margins were negatively impacted in by excess and obsolete inventory and warranty charges related principally to product portfolio changes and field service parts inventory changes 
offsetting this somewhat was the favorable impact of a higher mix of di revenues  which are predominately higher margin products than our ctp and traditional lines of business  as well as improved production efficiencies in our plate manufacturing 
gross profit as a percentage of service revenue was in compared to in service margins in were negatively impacted by charges for losses on field service parts inventory of million 
lower service margins also reflect the declining analog contract revenue base  which more than offset cost savings resulting from reductions in field service personnel 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel  parts and supplies  and contracted services required to conduct our equipment  consumables and laser diode development efforts 
consolidated research and development expenses of million in fiscal were essentially unchanged from million in the comparable prior year period 
research and development expenses for the presstek segment were million in compared to million in the decrease was due to lower payroll related expenses resulting from turnover of personnel 
research and development expenses for the lasertel segment were million in compared to million in the same prior year period 
the increased expense in relates primarily to incremental parts and supplies consumed in the product development process 
sales  marketing and customer support sales  marketing and customer support expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel  advertising  trade shows  promotional expenses  and travel costs associated with sales  marketing and customer support activities 
consolidated sales  marketing and customer support expenses of million in were flat compared to expenses of million in sales  marketing and customer support expenses for the presstek segment of million in fiscal decreased million from the comparable prior year expense of million due primarily to lower payroll  commission  and travel and entertainment expenses  offset somewhat by increased marketing costs in europe necessary to support planned growth 
sales  marketing and customer support expenses for the lasertel segment increased from million in to million in higher expenses in were due primarily to additional contract labor and advertising expense to continue expanding external sales 
general and administrative consolidated general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel and contracted professional services necessary to conduct our finance  information systems  legal  human resources and administrative activities 
general and administrative costs also include stock based compensation expenses  as well as bad debt reserves 
consolidated general and administrative expenses were million compared to million in the comparable prior year period 
general and administrative expense increases were primarily the result of higher patent defense and litigation activities of million  increased bad debt expense of million and increased professional fees of million related primarily to various detailed financial reviews conducted during the year 
general and administrative expenses in also include an increase of million in stock compensation related to stock option grants to officers  directors and employees compared to the same period in fiscal  as well as a million increase in expense related to restricted stock compensation granted to our ceo 
general and administrative expenses for the presstek segment were million in compared to million in the increased expense was due primarily to the increased professional fees  litigation  stock compensation  and bad debt expenses noted above 
general and administrative expenses for the lasertel segment of million in fiscal were essentially flat compared to million in fiscal amortization of intangible assets amortization expense of million in fiscal declined from million in the comparable prior year period 
these expenses relate to intangible assets recorded in connection with the company s acquisition of the business of the ab dick company  patents and other purchased intangible assets 
restructuring and other charges consolidated restructuring and other charges of million in decreased from million in restructuring expenses represent the cost of severance and separation expenses for employment contracts of former executives  as well as costs related to implementation of our business improvement plan bip 
the bip costs include the consolidation of the canadian back office operations and certain des plaines  illinois activities into the hudson  new hampshire operations  and include restructuring costs relating to severance  operating lease run out and inventory consolidation 
in fiscal  the company recognized restructuring and other charges of million 
these charges included million related to impairment of intangible assets associated with patent defense costs on the creo kodak litigation matter  million related to impairment of goodwill resulting from sfas valuation adjustments of long lived assets at precision as a result of the decision to discontinue its newspaper analog business  million for merger related costs primarily related to additional professional fees  and million related to the impairment of other assets 
in addition  approximately million of previously established accruals at the presstek segment were recognized in income in fiscal due principally to changes in the scope of previously announced severance programs 
interest and other income expense  net consolidated net interest and other expense in was million compared to million in the comparable prior year period 
increased expense in was due primarily to higher interest expense resulting from higher balances on our revolving credit facility  as well as higher interest rates 
offsetting this somewhat were gains on foreign currency translation 
provision benefit for income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  fas  the company recognized through its tax provision a million deferred tax benefit from the reversal of the previously recorded valuation allowance established on its us federal  state and local deferred tax assets  except for that portion where the evidence does not yet support a reversal 
to support the determination that is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets will be realized in the future  fas requires that the company consider all available positive and negative evidence 
based on a detailed analysis  the company concluded that evidence exists to support the us valuation allowance reversal as of december  fiscal compared to fiscal revenue consolidated revenue consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal equipment revenues increased million over fiscal resulting from strong di unit sales  including the introduction of the new di press 
partially offsetting increases in equipment revenue was a decline in both consumables and service revenues million each driven principally from a continuing slowdown in analog sales 
consistent with our strategy of migrating our customer base to digital solutions  digital product sales improved from million in to million in  an increase of year over year 
as a percentage of total product revenues  sales of digital solutions increased from approximately in to approximately in equipment revenues were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
growth in equipment revenues was due primarily to a increase in the number of di presses sold in fiscal compared to fiscal  driven largely by growth in our di product sales and the introduction of the new di press 
total di equipment sales were strong in both the north american and european markets during  as revenues improved by million  or  and million  or  respectively 
fiscal equipment revenues were also favorably impacted by the launch of a new generation ctp system  the vector tx  in the fourth quarter of the vector tx accounted for million of revenue in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal offsetting these items were lower dpm and dimension sales  which declined by million  or  and million  or  respectively 
sales of these units were impacted by competitive pressures  as well as quality issues on both equipment units and related consumable plates anthempro 
analog equipment revenues also declined from million in to million in this decline reflects the transition of our customer base from analog to digital solutions 
overall  digital equipment sales in the presstek segment increased from million in to million in on a consolidated basis  digital sales as a percentage of total equipment revenues in accounted for of sales compared to in revenue for the lasertel segment of million in represented a year over year increase of  or million  due primarily to the addition of two new customers  as well as higher sales to the presstek segment 
revenues generated from consumables sales decreased year over year  from million in to million in the decrease in sales was primarily attributable to the anticipated slowdown in the analog market resulting from the continued migration of our customer base from analog to digital solutions 
total analog consumables sales declined from million in to million in  a decrease of 
partially offsetting this decline were improved sales of digital products  which increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to increased placements of di and ctp equipment and strengthening relationships with oem partners 
these increases were partially offset by declines in older technology digital lines such as dpm consumables 
overall  digital sales of consumables products increased million year over year  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total consumables revenues  digital sales accounted for of sales in compared to in service and parts revenues were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in the decrease in revenue was due primarily to the elimination of certain legacy service contracts  as well as a reduction in billable service and analog parts sales as our customer base continues to migrate to digital solutions 
cost of revenue consolidated cost of product  consisting of costs of material  labor and overhead  shipping and handling costs and warranty expenses  was million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal this increase was primarily the result of increased product revenues year over year 
in addition  presstek recorded million of incremental warranty costs related to the vector tx and anthempro plate quality issues experienced during consolidated cost of service and parts revenues was million in fiscal  slightly lower than the million reported in these amounts represent the costs of spare parts  labor and overhead associated with the ongoing service of products 
costs in were impacted by higher fuel expenses  as well as increased technology costs related to an upgrade of the communications and logistics capabilities of our service technicians and engineers 
these costs were offset by the termination of service personnel in north america and the use of independent service contractors during the second half of  the result of a restructuring plan intended to realign our service costs with a declining analog revenue base 
gross margin consolidated gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was in compared to in gross margin as a percentage of product revenue was compared to in the product gross margin decrease reflects a heavier mix of equipment revenues as a percentage of total sales  which historically carry significantly lower margins than presstek s consumables line of products  increased warranty costs related to quality issues experienced with our vector tx and anthempro plates  partially offset by improved margins in our lasertel segment 
gross margin as a percentage of service and parts revenues decreased from in to in the decrease in margin percentage is principally due to a decline in the analog contract revenue base  which despite restructuring action taken to realign fixed service delivery costs in the second half of  negatively impacted margins 
we are currently working to transition our legacy analog service contracts to a time and materials model which  in the short term  due to fixed price arrangements on these contracts  has exerted additional downward pressure on our service margins 
research and development research and development expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses for personnel  parts and supplies  and contracted services required to conduct our equipment  consumables and laser diode development efforts 
consolidated research and development expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease is principally attributable to efficiencies realized from the integration of the acquired abdick business into the company during the fourth quarter of research and development expenses for the presstek segment were million in  a decrease of million compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to efficiencies realized from the integration of the abdick business into this segment 
research and development expenses for the lasertel segment were million in compared to million in the increase reflects increased development costs associated with specialized new products for third party foreign customers 
sales  marketing and customer support sales  marketing and customer support expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses for personnel  advertising  trade shows  promotional expenses  and travel costs associated with sales  marketing and customer support activities 
to improve operations  we took steps in both fiscal and to strengthen capacity and capability within the sales  marketing and customer support area through reorganization  training in advanced technology products and services  and changes in key personnel 
we also eliminated costs  primarily for customer support and marketing personnel by integrating us marketing and customer support operations within the presstek segment 
consolidated sales  marketing and customer support expenses of million in fiscal were relatively unchanged from expenses of million in fiscal sales  marketing and customer support expenses for the presstek segment were million and million in and  respectively 
sales  marketing and customer support expenses for the lasertel segment increased from million in to million in general and administrative consolidated general and administrative expenses  primarily comprised of payroll and related expenses for personnel  and contracted professional services necessary to conduct our finance  information systems  human resources and administrative activities  were million in compared to million in this decrease is primarily attributable to cost savings realized by the integration of the abdick us operations into presstek 
as a percentage of total sales  consolidated general and administrative expenses declined from in to in general and administrative expenses for the presstek segment were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in expense is primarily attributable to the elimination of redundant costs resulting from the integration of the abdick us operations into the segment 
general and administrative expenses for the lasertel segment increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to a change in allowance for doubtful accounts arising from certain customer accounts 
amortization of intangible assets intangible asset amortization expense increased from million in to million in amortization relates to intangible assets recorded in connection with the company s abdick and precision acquisitions  patents and other purchased intangible assets 
restructuring and other charges credits in fiscal  the company recognized restructuring and other charges of million 
these charges included million related to impairment of intangible assets associated with patent defense costs on the creo litigation matter  million related to impairment of goodwill resulting from sfas valuation adjustments of long lived assets at precision as a result of the decision to discontinue its newspaper analog business  million for merger related costs primarily related to additional professional fees  and million related to the impairment of other assets 
in addition  approximately million of previously established accruals at the presstek segment were recognized in income in fiscal due principally to changes in the scope of previously announced severance programs 
in fiscal  we recognized million of restructuring and other charges related to precision and abdick 
these charges included severance and fringe benefit costs  executive and other contractual obligations  and a settlement with previously terminated employees 
interest and other income expense  net net interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in the current year period is attributable to lower outstanding long term debt resulting from the repayments of principal 
on september   an agreement related to the abdick acquisition under which we were reimbursed million was approved by the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware 
the net amount  after reductions for legal fees and additional adjustments for settlement of various assets and liabilities related to this action  totaled million  and is included as a component of interest and other income expense  net  in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  the balance of other income expense  net relates to gains or losses on foreign currency transactions for all periods presented 
provision benefit for income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the variance from the federal statutory rate for fiscal was primarily due to the reversal of valuation allowance provided against our net deferred tax assets in the us the variance from the federal statutory rate for fiscal was primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses previously offset by a valuation allowance  foreign taxes  and alternative minimum taxes 
in fiscal  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

for comparative purposes  all prior periods presented have been reclassified on a consistent basis 
precision lithograining corp 
analog newspaper business during december  the company terminated production in south hadley  massachusetts of precision branded analog plates used in newspaper applications 
results of operations of the discontinued analog newspaper business of precision consist of the following in thousands  except per share data december  december  december  revenue loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes loss from discontinued operations loss from disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax benefit of for the year ended december  net loss from discontinued operations loss per diluted share as of december   and in accordance with sfas and sfas  the company reviewed the potential impairment of long lived assets associated with the analog newspaper business and goodwill of the precision reporting unit and determined that impairment charges aggregating million were required 
of this amount million relates to the impairment of goodwill  million relates to the acceleration of depreciation on fixed assets abandoned  million relates to the acceleration of amortization on certain intangible assets and million relates to the adjustment of inventory on hand to the lower of cost or market 
impairment charges of the reporting unit goodwill resulting from the abandonment of the analog newspaper business are reflected within restructuring and other charges of continuing operations  and the remaining charges included in the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal there have been no further impairment charges incurred in fiscal relating to this matter 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operating and capital investment requirements primarily through cash flows from operations and borrowings 
at december   we had million of cash and million of working capital  compared to million of cash and million of working capital at december  continuing operations our operating activities provided million of cash in fiscal cash provided by operating activities came from net income  after adjustments for non cash depreciation  amortization  restructuring and merger related expenses  provisions for warranty costs and accounts receivable allowances  stock compensation expense  deferred income taxes  and losses on the disposal of assets 
cash provided by operating activities were further benefited from a decrease in accounts receivable of million and an increase of million in accrued expenses 
the decrease in accounts receivable reflects our continued focus on cash management 
accrued expense increases are primarily related to increased professional fee accruals resulting from the review of inventory and receivable reserves  as well as accruals related to certain legal matters 
these amounts were partially offset by an increase of million in inventory  a decrease of million in accounts payable  an increase of million in other current assets  and a decrease in deferred revenue of million 
inventory increases at december  are primarily attributable to timing of certain press deliveries 
day s sales outstanding were at december  and at december  the decrease in accounts payable relates primarily to the timing of purchases and payments to suppliers 
the increase in other current asset relates to an insurance recovery receivable 
the decrease in deferred revenue relates to a reduction in service contracts resulting from the continuing erosion of our analog customer base 
we used million of net cash for investing activities during  comprised of million of additions to property  plant and equipment  million of investments in patents and other intangible assets and million of transaction and accrued integration costs paid related to the acquisition of the abdick business 
our additions to property  plant and equipment primarily relate to production equipment and investments in our infrastructure  including costs related to the implementation of a new service management system 
our financing activities generated million of net cash  comprised of million of cash received from the exercise of stock options and purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase program and million of net borrowings under our current line of credit 
these amounts were offset by payments on our current term loan and capital lease aggregating million 
discontinued operations operating activities of discontinued operations provided million in cash in fiscal cash generated by operating activities reflect a net loss of million  after adjustments for non cash depreciation  amortization  provisions for warranty and accounts receivable allowances 
cash generated by operating activities also included a decrease of million in accounts receivable and million in inventory 
our current senior secured credit facilities  referred to as the facilities  include a million five year secured term loan  referred to as the term loan  and a million five year secured revolving line of credit  referred to as the revolver 
at december   the outstanding balance on the revolver was million and we had million outstanding under letters of credit  thereby reducing the amount available under the revolver to million 
at december  and december   the interest rates on the outstanding balance of the revolver were and  respectively 
principal payments on the term loan are made in consecutive quarterly installments of million  with a final settlement of all remaining principal and unpaid interest on november  the facilities were used to partially finance the acquisition of the business of abdick  and are available for working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the facilities bear interest at either i the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus applicable margins or ii the prime rate  as defined in the agreement  plus applicable margins 
the applicable margins range from to for libor  or up to for the prime rate  based on certain financial performance 
at december  and december   the effective interest rates on the term loan were and  respectively 
under the terms of the revolver and term loan  we are required to meet various financial covenants on a quarterly and annual basis  including maximum funded debt to ebitda  a non us gaap measurement that is defined in the facilities as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and restructuring and other charges credits  and minimum fixed charge coverage covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
due to delays in reporting financial statements for the period ended december  to its lenders  the company amended the terms of the revolver and term loan with the lenders to provide that annual financial statements could be delivered to the lenders on or before april  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements with its lenders in october  which were intended to protect the company s long term debt against fluctuations in libor rates 
under the interest rate swaps libor was set at a minimum of and a maximum of

 accounting for leases sfas 
the equipment is included as a component of property  plant and equipment and the current and long term principal amounts of the lease obligation are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that existing funds  cash flows from operations  and cash available under our revolver should be sufficient to satisfy working capital requirements and capital expenditures through at least the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not require additional financing  or that such additional financing  if needed  would be available on acceptable terms 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations at december  consist of the following in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years five or more years senior secured credit facilities estimated interest payments on senior secured credit facilities capital lease  including contractual interest royalty obligation executive contractual obligations operating leases total contractual obligations the amounts above related to estimated interest payments on the facilities are based upon the interest rates in effect at december  actual interest amounts could differ from the estimates above

the agreement provides for total royalty payments to be no less than million and not greater than million over the life of the agreement 
as of december   the company had paid fuji million related to this agreement 
we have employment agreements with certain of our employees  some of which include change of control agreements that provide them with benefits should their employment with us be terminated other than for cause or their disability or death  or if they resign for good reason  as defined in these agreements  within a certain period of time from the date of any change of control of us 
from time to time we have engaged in sales of equipment that is leased by or intended to be leased by a third party purchaser to another party 
in certain situations  we may retain recourse obligations to a financing institution involved in providing financing to the ultimate lessee in the event the lessee of the equipment defaults on its lease obligations 
in certain such instances  we may refurbish and remarket the equipment on behalf of the financing company  should the ultimate lessee default on payment of the lease 
in certain circumstances  should the resale price of such equipment fall below certain predetermined levels  we would  under these arrangements  reimburse the financing company for any such shortfall in sale price a shortfall payment 
the maximum contingent obligation under these shortfall payment arrangements is estimated to be million at december  effect of inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our financial conditions or results of operations  although this risk is discussed under item of this form k 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes totaling million  of which million resulted from stock option compensation deductions for us federal tax purposes and million resulted from operating losses 
to the extent that net operating losses resulting from stock option compensation deductions result in reduction of current taxes payable  the benefit will be credited directly to additional paid in capital 
the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited in the future if the company experiences an ownership change  as defined by the internal revenue code 
an ownership change occurs when the ownership percentage of or greater of stockholders changes by more than over a three year period 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as adopted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions also affect the amount of reported revenue and expenses during the period 
management believes the most judgmental estimates include those related to product returns  warranty obligations  allowances for doubtful accounts  slow moving and obsolete inventories  income taxes  the valuation of goodwill  intangible assets  long lived assets and deferred tax assets  stock based compensation and litigation 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other appropriate factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
revenue recognition revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue principally from the sale of products equipment  consumables  laser diodes and services equipment maintenance contracts  installation  training  support  and spare parts 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition sab and emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as equipment and services  revenue is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value 
amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until all revenue recognition criteria are met 
product revenue end users under the company s standard terms and conditions of sale of equipment  title and risk of loss are transferred to end user customers upon completion of installation and revenue is recognized at that time  unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant deliverables remain 
sales of other products  including printing plates  are generally recognized at the time of shipment 
oems product revenue and any related royalties for products sold to original equipment manufacturers oem are recognized at the time of shipment as installation is not required and title and risk of loss pass at shipment 
oem contracts do not generally include price protection or product return rights  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product 
distributors revenue for product sold to distributors  whereby the distributor is responsible for installation  is recognized at shipment  unless other revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
revenue for product sold to distributors under contracts which involve company installation of equipment is recognized upon installation  unless end user customer acceptance is uncertain  significant deliverables remain  or other revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
except in cases of contract termination which may include limited product return rights  distributor contracts do not generally include price protection or product return rights  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product 
service and parts revenue revenue for installation services  including time and material billings  are recognized as services are rendered 
revenue associated with maintenance or extended service agreements is recognized ratably over the contract period 
revenue associated with training and support services is recognized as services are rendered 
certain fees and other reimbursements are recognized as revenue when the related services have been performed or the revenue is otherwise earned 
leases the company may offer customer financing to assist customers in the acquisition of presstek products 
at the time a financing transaction is consummated  which qualifies as a sales type lease  the company records equipment revenue equal to the net present value of future lease payments 
any remaining balance is recognized as finance income using the effective interest method over the term of the lease 
leases not qualifying as sales type leases are accounted for as operating leases 
the company recognizes revenue from operating leases on an accrual basis as the rental payments become due 
multiple element arrangements in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition sab and emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as equipment  consumables or services  revenue is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value 
the fair value of any undelivered elements  such as warranty  training and services  is deferred until delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
rights of return a general right of return or cancellation does not exist once product is delivered to the customer  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product 
product revenues are recorded net of estimated returns  which are adjusted periodically  based upon historical rates of return 
shipping and handling the company accounts for shipping and handling fees passed on to customers as revenue 
shipping and handling costs are reported as components of cost of revenue product and cost of revenue service and parts 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms  carried at face value less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates its allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis and adjusts for potential credit losses when it determines that receivables are at risk for collection based upon the length of time receivables are outstanding  past transaction history and various other criteria 
receivables are written off against reserves in the period they are determined to be uncollectible 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we assess the recoverability of inventory to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory that is in excess of future requirements is written down to its estimated market value based upon forecasted demand for its products 
if actual demand is less favorable than what has been forecasted by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
intangible assets with estimated lives and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recoverability of intangible assets with estimated lives and other long lived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net undiscounted pretax cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable  the company will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the related estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is based on either discounted future pretax operating cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
the company determines the discount rate for this analysis based on the expected internal rate of return of the related business and does not allocate interest charges to the asset or asset group being measured 
considerable judgment is required to estimate discounted future operating cash flows 
judgment is also required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 
factors that could indicate that an impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  strategic changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
we must make assumptions about future cash flows  future operating plans  discount rates and other factors in the models and valuation reports 
to the extent these future projections and estimates change  the estimated amounts of impairment could differ from current estimates 
patents represent the cost of preparing and filing applications to patent the company s proprietary technologies  in addition to certain patent and license rights obtained in the company s acquisitions or other related transactions 
such costs are amortized over a period ranging from five to seven years  beginning on the date the patents or rights are issued or acquired 
from time to time  the company enters into agreements with third parties under which the party will design and prototype a product incorporating presstek products and technology 
the capitalized costs associated with rights or intellectual property under these agreements will be amortized over the estimated sales life cycle and future cash flows of the product 
the company does not amortize capitalized costs related to either patents or purchased intellectual property until the respective asset has been placed into service 
the company amortizes license agreements and loan origination fees over the term of the respective agreement 
the amortizable lives of the company s other intangible assets are as follows trade names years customer relationships years software licenses years non compete covenants years stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for all of employee and non employee director stock based compensation awards using the intrinsic value method under apb  and provided the required disclosures in accordance with sfas on january   we adopted sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
we recognize the fair value of stock compensation in our consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period  generally on a straight line basis for time vested awards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period 
further  we have elected under sfas r to recognize the fair value of awards with pro rata vesting on a straight line basis 
previously  we had followed accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  which resulted in the accounting for employee share options at their intrinsic value in the consolidated financial statements 
under sfas r  our stock based compensation is affected by our stock price as well as valuation assumptions  including the volatility of our stock price  expected term of the option  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model for estimating the fair value on the date of grant of employee stock options 
prior to january   we used historical volatility to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options 
starting on january   we estimated future volatility using a combination of historical and implied volatility 
we believe that a combination of historical and implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the market s expectations of future volatility 
any changes in these assumptions may materially affect the estimated fair value of the stock based award 
accounting for income taxes the process of accounting for income taxes involves calculating our current tax obligation or refund and assessing the nature and measurements of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and our net operating loss nol and credit carryforwards  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in each period  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
to the extent we believe that we would not meet the test that recovery is more likely than not  we would establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we would adjust our tax provision or tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  including estimates associated with uncertain tax positions and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets based on the weight of all positive and negative factors  including cumulative trends in profitability 
we have accumulated us federal and state income tax nol carryforwards  research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
in the fourth quarter of  we reversed the valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet primarily representing nols from our us operations 
previously  we had recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets on our balance sheet until it was more likely than not that the tax assets related to either our us or international operations would be realized 
we assess our ability to utilize our nol and tax credit carryforwards in future periods and record any resulting adjustments that may be required to defer income tax expense 
in addition  we reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol and tax credit carryforwards utilized currently 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments and charges 
based upon a review of historical operating performance through  and our expectation that we will generate profits in the us and our international operations in the foreseeable future  we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the us and international deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf is effective for periods beginning after december   with earlier application permitted 
eitf requires disclosure of the accounting policy for any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction ie  sales  use  value added on a gross basis included in revenues and costs or net basis excluded from revenues and costs 
the company excludes these amounts from its revenues and costs  accordingly  no additional disclosure will be required 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin was adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and is required to be adopted by the company in fiscal the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material impact 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption is permitted  provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of sfas the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material impact 
in june  the fasb also ratified eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf is effective  on a prospective basis  for fiscal years beginning after december  and will be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal the company does not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after december   and will be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal the company will apply sfas r prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  also in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement requires all entities to report non controlling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same manner as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
this eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and non controlling interests by requiring that they be treated as equity transactions 
the company will be required to adopt the provisions of sfas in the first quarter of and is currently evaluating the impact of such adoption on its consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purpose 
as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities  commodity price risk  and to a lesser extent  our investing activities and foreign currency fluctuations 
the company has established procedures to manage its fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our long term borrowings are in variable rate instruments  with interest rates tied to either the prime rate or the libor 
a basis point change in these rates would have an impact of approximately million on our annual interest expense  assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held at the end of fiscal commodity price movements create a market risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw materials 
the company purchases aluminum for use in manufacturing consumables products and is embedded in certain components we purchase from major suppliers 
from time to time  we enter into agreements with certain suppliers to manage price risks within a specified range of prices  however  our suppliers generally pass on significant commodity price changes to us in the form of revised prices on future purchases 
in general  the company has not used commodity forward or option contracts to manage this market risk 
the company operates foreign subsidiaries in canada and europe and is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
presstek routinely evaluates whether the foreign exchange risk associated with its foreign currency exposures acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency 
in general  the company does not hedge the net assets or net income of its foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  certain key customers and strategic partners are not located in the united states 
as a result  these parties may be subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
if their home country currency were to decrease in value relative to the united states dollar  their ability to purchase and market our products could be adversely affected and our products may become less competitive to them 
this may have an adverse impact on our business 
likewise  certain major suppliers are not located in the united states and thus  such suppliers are subject to foreign exchange rate risks in transactions with us 
decreases in the value of their home country currency  versus that of the united states dollar  could cause fluctuations in supply pricing which could have an adverse effect on our business
