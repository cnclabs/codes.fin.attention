we are aggressively exploring canada s largest contiguous oil sands land holding  which is located in northeast alberta  northwest saskatchewan and oilsands quest is leading the development of an oil sands industry in the province of saskatchewan 
oilsands quest  together with its subsidiaries  is in the exploration and development stage and does not currently have any income from operating activities 
for a more detailed discussion of our business see part  item  description of business 
overview of results and outlook during the year ended april   the company s activities included an exploration drilling program of delineation test wells on its permit lands in saskatchewan and alberta  advancement of its pre commercialization evaluation studies on and reservoir test program on its axe lake discovery  a comprehensive d and d seismic program in saskatchewan and on adjacent alberta permits  and an extensive environmental program consisting of monitoring and baseline assessment studies 
during the year ended april   we raised million  net of issuance costs  through private placement share issuances  a marketed public offering and proceeds of warrant and option exercises to fund these activities and future programs 
operations summary exploration program on march   we concluded the exploration program in the field for which drilling began on september  the program demonstrated continued success on the company s contiguous oil sands exploration lands in saskatchewan and alberta 
overall  a total of test wells were drilled with in saskatchewan and in the company s first exploration program conducted on its adjacent land holdings in alberta 
we also conducted a comprehensive d and d seismic program on our permit lands in saskatchewan and alberta 
table of contents totaling  kilometres  miles 
in addition  we continued to conduct a comprehensive million cdn environmental program on the permit lands  consisting of monitoring and baseline studies which formed the basis of the plans approved by the federal and saskatchewan provincial governments

axe lake discovery in january  following our initial drilling season  we designated the discovery area  plus certain additional prospective lands associated with it  as the axe lake discovery 
the designated axe lake discovery area is a notional area identified by us and located in an area of approximately sections square miles located in townships and  ranges and west of the rd meridian 
as a result of the winter program  the drilled portion of the axe lake discovery area now covers approximately sections square miles of permits ps and ps oilsands quest located in the north half of township and the south half of township  ranges and west of the rd meridian 
axe lake discovery reservoir development activities in january  following extensive  ongoing laboratory testing  reservoir simulation studies and the determination of the initial definition of a reservoir field test program to evaluate reservoir response to varying temperatures and pressures of steam and steam with solvents  we announced a program of reservoir testing at up to three sites within the axe lake discovery for site preparation and construction of facilities for oilsands quest s reservoir test program at axe lake commenced in january and were halted through april and may for spring break up 
activity recommenced in june and is ongoing at present 
the large steam generator final acceptance test was successfully concluded and the steam generator is being transported to site 
other major equipment will also arrive on site during facilities installation which commences first week of july 
steam and hot water injection into the reservoir on test site is planned for late summer phase one of the axe lake discovery reservoir test program will consider up to three test sites with varying overburden and pay thicknesses with one vertical injection well and five vertical observation wells per test site 
the purpose of phase one of the axe lake test program is to measure resource specific heat and fluid movement under specific operating conditions on a field scale to complement our ongoing simulation and laboratory analysis studies 
phase one has received regulatory approval 
current plans call for placement of horizontal wells in late summer  with injection to begin following initial results from the phase one program at test site subject to the requisite approvals 
phase two of the test program will consider expanding the three test sites with horizontal wells and or injecting mobilization agents other than steam 
the purpose of phase two is to evaluate and analyze information gathered from phase one regarding mobilization with steam and or hot water and to measure field scale response using horizontal wells 
phase three of the axe lake discovery test program is currently in the scoping phase  options being considered range from a continued reservoir test program to a technology feasibility pilot to a full commercial demonstration project 
by june six  barrel heated liquid storage tanks were received at test site  and two  barrel heated liquid storage tanks were delivered to both test sites and the preliminary engineering contracts for the surface facilities for test site were awarded and design work has commenced 
the large steam generator final acceptance test was successfully concluded and the steam generator is being transported to site 
other major equipment will also arrive on site during facilities installation which commences first week of july and most of this equipment will be installed in all season building structures 
construction of these facilities is expected to be completed approximately eight weeks after the arrival of the major equipment 

table of contents by the end of july  we expect to resume drilling of the wells required for injection and monitoring at the three reservoir test sites  including the remaining two of the six wells at test site and wells at test site and as appropriate 
abandonment and reclamation costs we are responsible for compliance with terms and conditions of environmental and regulatory approvals and all laws and regulations regarding the abandonment of a project and reclamation of its lands at the end of its economic life  which abandonment and reclamation costs may be substantial 
a breach of such legislation and or regulations may result in the issuance of remedial orders  the suspension of approvals  or the imposition of fines and penalties  including an order for cessation of operations at the site until satisfactory remedies are made 
we have not yet recognized any retirement  abandonment or reclamation obligation in our financial statements 
all delineation wells are abandoned and reclaimed immediately and these costs are included with our exploration costs incurred 
as at april   we estimate the total undiscounted amount required to settle the asset retirement obligations in respect of the company s wells and facilities is approximately million 
this estimate includes the costs to reclaim the air strip  camp site  access roads and four reservoir test wells 
however  since we have yet to determine the commercial viability of the axe lake discovery we cannot with certainty determine a reasonable timeframe in which those costs will be incurred 
this estimate could change as the reclamation requirements will be a function of regulatory regulations in place at the time 
outlook over the next twelve months we will initiate the activities necessary to establish a commercial development plan for the axe lake discovery  including aggressively progressing the reservoir test programs in order to evaluate an optimum in situ oil sands recovery process 
we expect to select one or more recovery technology options  conduct one or more technology feasibility tests and commence development of a commercial project 
the following is an overview of key activities continuing and planned in the next twelve months continue exploration and delineation activities to further define the location  extent and quality of the discovered resources at axe lake and raven ridge for a complete description of our independent resource estimates  see part i  item properties and statement of oil and gas information  continue to evaluate drilling data and perform advanced laboratory studies of bitumen characterization and recovery methods  continue to undertake computer reservoir modeling and simulation studies to aid in the selection of the optimal recovery technologies at axe lake and raven ridge  continue to engineer and procure surface and down hole equipment for reservoir field tests  conduct injection tests with steam and other mobilization agents in vertical and horizontal wells to confirm laboratory and simulation studies  continue to conduct environmental programs to establish base line data and facilitate regulatory approvals  continue to conduct advanced economic feasibility and risk assessment studies for full commercial project development  continue to accelerate scoping and engineering designs for our initial commercial development at the axe lake discovery  including initiating engineering plans for the first  barrel per day commercial project at the axe lake discovery  initiate joint venture partnership and capital market negotiations for the development of the axe lake discovery  and evaluate market alternatives for bitumen sales from one or more commercial projects at axe lake 
oilsands quest and its engineering consultants have embarked upon preliminary engineering of an initial  barrels per day commercial project planned for the development of a portion of axe lake in the specific area where the first series of reservoir tests is being conducted 
management also continues to conduct advanced economic 
table of contents feasibility and risk assessment studies for full commercial project development  including assessment of an aggressive approach to a first prospective project  which could result in completion during or oilsands quest has also commissioned a study of infrastructure and markets by purvin gertz inc to assist in its planning process 
development of a commercial project remains subject to regulatory and other contingencies such as successful reservoir tests  board sanctioning and financing 
in addition  we will continue to conduct an extensive exploration program activity to further define the location  extent and quality of the potential oil sands resource at the wallace creek and eagles nest prospects 
we also intend to conduct an exploratory drilling program on the pasquia hills oil shale prospect in and research potential methods for kerogen recovery from oil shales 
our planned activities over the next twelve months as outlined above will require expenditures of approximately million 
if we accelerate commercial development at axe lake or any of our other prospects  our cash requirements over the next two years will increase significantly from the amount noted above 
additional funding may also be required if our current planned activities are changed in scope or if actual costs differ from estimates of current plans 
we believe the company will have access to sufficient funding and sources of capital for its planned activities to april  because we constantly and actively monitor our expenditure budgets  if sufficient funding is not available we can adjust our expenditure plans based on available cash 
we plan to fund future operations by way of financing  including a public offering or private placement of equity or debt securities 
our development strategy also includes considering partners on a joint venture basis on our specific projects to fund the development of such projects in a timely and responsible manner 
however  there is no assurance that debt or equity financing or joint venture partner arrangements will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  to meet these requirements 
the company has no revenues  and its operating results  profitability and the future rate of growth depend solely on management s ability to successfully implement the business plans and on the ability to raise further funding 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion of liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in part ii
