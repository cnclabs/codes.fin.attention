financial overview we recognized revenues of million during  as compared to million in fiscal and million in the year over year increase in reflects significant growth in term licenses 
term license revenue increased to million in from million in maintenance and other recurring revenues were up million or year over year  and professional services posted strong gains of to million in in addition  despite our transition from a perpetual model  perpetual license fees in were flat compared to we have grown net revenue year over year for several reasons  including the following our product innovation helped drive acquisition of new customers  resulting in incremental term license contract value and professional services billings 
our completion of term license implementations resulted in incremental term license and professional services revenues 
we have a large installed base of customers who continue to upgrade and expand their usage of our products resulting in higher maintenance and recurring revenues 
our existing term licenses provide a consistent  recurring revenue stream 
total recurring revenues  which we define as term license  perpetual maintenance  and other recurring revenues  have increased to of total net revenues during  as compared to during in addition  international revenue increased million or during total expenses  including cost of revenues  were million in fiscal  compared with million in and million in our expenses increased in from largely as a result increased payroll  variable compensation and benefit expenses resulting from increases in headcount and our strong performance 
during  we incurred only million of restructuring charges compared to million in primarily relating to the exit of our previous headquarters facility 
in november  we incurred facility and exit costs of million related to the brannan facility that will continue to be incurred without economic benefit to us 
our income from operations in was million compared to a loss from operations in of million 
during  we recognized million of income tax expense compared to a benefit from income taxes in of million due primarily to the release  in  of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets originally established in the fourth quarter of as we now believe that our deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 
we earned net income of million  resulting in diluted earnings per share of for we generated million in cash from operations in compared to million in  primarily as a result of revenue growth and collections of resulting customer receivables 
during  we repurchased million shares under our share repurchase plan  for a total cash outlay of million and an average price of 
term license and term license deferral we are continuing the process of converting the company s license revenues from a perpetual model to a predominantly term model 
under a perpetual pricing model  customers purchase a license to use our software indefinitely and generally we recognize all license revenue at the time of sale  maintenance is purchased under an annual renewable contract  and recognized ratably over the contract period 
under a term pricing model  customers purchase a license to use our software and receive maintenance for a limited period of time and we recognize all of the revenue ratably over the length of the contract 
this has the effect of lowering revenues in the early stages of the transition  but increasing the total potential value of the customer relationship 
moving new customer sales in the advent investment management aim segment from a perpetual to a term licensing model has had the effect of lowering our reported revenue growth rates over the past two years and may  depending on our new term license bookings  continue to have an impact through however  because our products are used by customers for an average of approximately ten years  we believe this change to our business model is significant for the long term growth and value of the business as we expect total revenues from a customer to increase over time 
for example  over a ten year period  a customer may enter into two or more contracts for the same software product and services under a term license model 
when a customer purchases a term license together with implementation services  we do not recognize any revenue under the contract until the implementation services are complete and the remaining services are substantially complete 
if the implementation services are still in progress as of quarter end  we will defer all of the contract revenues to a subsequent quarter 
at the point professional services are substantially completed  we recognize a pro rata amount of the term license revenue  professional services fees earned and related expenses  based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services 
term license revenue for the remaining contract years and the remaining deferred professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized ratably over the remaining contract length 
during  we deferred net revenues of million and directly related expenses of million associated with our term licensing model 
the impact of these deferrals on our operating income was approximately million 
the million net deferral of revenue is composed of a net deferral of million of professional services revenue and a net deferral of million of term license revenue 
professional services and term license revenue deferrals continued to increase as the deferral for current projects exceeded the amount recognized from completed past projects 
we expect that the term license component of the deferred revenue balance will increase or decrease in the future depending on the amount of new bookings relative to the number of implementations that reach substantial completion in a particular quarter 
we currently expect that the professional services component of the deferred revenue balance will continue to increase through at least amounts of revenues and directly related expenses deferred as of december  and associated with our term licensing deferral were as follows in millions december december deferred revenues short term long term total directly related expenses short term long term total deferred net revenues and directly related expenses are classified as deferred revenues short term and long term  and prepaid expenses and other  and other assets  net  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets 
the transition to a term model also has the effect of decreasing operating cash flows in the early stages of the transition 
under perpetual pricing  the entire license fee and the first year of maintenance is generally billed and collected at the commencement of the arrangement 
under term pricing  a typical contract term is three years 
we generally bill and collect term license fee installments in advance of each annual period 
the amount of the annual term billing is less than the perpetual billing  resulting in lower cash flows in the initial annual term license period 
annual term billing results in an increase in deferred revenues and an increase in operating cash flows at the commencement of each annual billing period 
recurring revenue model and revenue presentation during  we recognized approximately of total net revenue from recurring sources  which we define as revenues from term license  maintenance on perpetual licenses and other recurring 
this high proportion of recurring revenues allows us to take a long term view and invest in our business while remaining confident that our operating results will be reasonably predictable 
during the first quarter of  we changed our presentation of revenue and associated cost of revenues to more clearly show the nature and components of our revenues under a term licensing model and the predominance of revenue from recurring sources 
we believe the current presentation more clearly reflects our business as well as the principal underlying factors impacting our long term growth and predictability 
we currently categorize our revenues as follows term license  maintenance and other recurring  perpetual license fees and professional services and other

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the process we use to develop estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other information that we believe are reasonable for making judgments at the time the estimates are made 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following accounting policies contain the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and deferred revenues  income taxes  stock based compensation  restructuring charges and related accruals  business combinations  goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  legal contingencies  and sales returns and accounts receivable allowances 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies contain our most significant judgments and estimates 
our revenue policy is further described in note  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from term license  maintenance and other recurring  perpetual license fees  and professional services and other 
we offer a wide variety of products and services to a large number of financially sophisticated customers 
while many of our lower priced license transactions  maintenance contracts  subscription based transactions and professional services projects conform to a standard structure  many of our larger transactions are complex and may require significant review and judgment in our application of generally accepted accounting principles 
software licenses 
we recognize revenue from the licensing of software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we generally use a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding order forms and signed contracts from the distributor s customers 
revenue is recognized once shipment to the distributor s customer has taken place and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
delivery occurs when a product is delivered to a common carrier fob shipping point or upon notification that software is available for electronic download through our fulfillment vendor 
some of our arrangements include acceptance provisions  and if such acceptance provisions are present  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess whether the collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable based on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of the customer determined through review of credit reports  our transaction history with the customer  other available information and pertinent country risk if the customer is located outside the united states 
our standard payment terms are due at days or less  but payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
software licenses are sold with maintenance and  frequently  professional services 
we typically license our products on a per server  per user basis with the price per customer varying based on the selection of the products licensed  the assets under administration  the number of site installations and the number of authorized users 
we have continued our transition from selling mostly perpetual licenses to selling a mix of term and perpetual licenses  and we expect term license revenue to increase as a proportion of total recurring revenues which we define as term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues in the future 
term license revenue comprised approximately and of total recurring revenues in and  respectively 
revenue recognition for software licensed under term and perpetual license models differs depending on which type of contract a customer signs term licenses term license contract prices include fees for both the software license and maintenance 
we offer multi year term licenses by which a customer makes a binding commitment that typically spans three years 
for multi year term licenses  we have not established vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe of fair value for the software license and maintenance components and  as a result  in situations where we are also performing related professional services  we defer all revenue and directly related expenses under the arrangement until the implementation services are complete and the remaining services are substantially complete 
at the point professional services are substantially completed  we recognize a pro rata amount of the term license revenue  professional services fees earned and related expenses  based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services 
we determine whether services are substantially complete by consulting with the professional services group and applying management judgment 
term license revenue for the remaining contract years and the remaining deferred professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized ratably over the remaining contract length 
when multi year term licenses are sold and do not include related professional services  we recognize the entire term license revenue ratably over the period of the contract term from the effective date of the license agreement assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenues from term licenses are included in term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues on the consolidated statement of operations 
perpetual licenses we allocate revenue to delivered components  normally the license component of the arrangement  using the residual method  based on vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements generally the maintenance and professional services components  which is specific to us 
we determine the fair value of the undelivered elements based on the historical evidence of the company s stand alone sales of these elements to third parties and renewal rates 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for any undelivered elements  then the entire arrangement fee is deferred until delivery of that element has occurred except post customer support 
revenues from perpetual licenses are included in perpetual license fees revenue on the consolidated statement of operations 
certain of our perpetual and term license contracts include asset based fee structures that provide additional revenues based on the assets that the client manages using our software assets under administration or aua 
contracts containing an aua fee structure have a defined measurement period which requires the client to self report actual aua in arrears of the specified period 
aua fees above the stated minimum fee for the same period are considered incremental fees 
because incremental fees are not determinable until the conclusion of the measurement period  they are both earned and recognized in arrears  on a quarterly or annual basis 
incremental fees from perpetual aua contracts are included in perpetual license fees on the consolidated statement of operations 
incremental fees from term aua contracts are included in term license  maintenance and other recurring revenue on the consolidated statement of operations 
for certain term aua contracts signed in  which will be entering the second year of the arrangement in  we began accruing the minimum aua component of the fees in the applicable period during the first quarter of rather than in arrears as was the treatment for earlier contracts 
we have gained more experience in working with these types of arrangements and are able to conclude that the minimum fees are fixed and determinable 
the change in the first quarter of to our revenue recognition practice to start to accrue for minimum fees is based on an overall affirmative experience with our existing aua based arrangements where our historical experience has shown that we have received the aua report  invoiced the client for both the minimum and incremental amounts  and received payment 
therefore  beginning in the first quarter of  we are recognizing aua contract minimum fees in the period to which they are applicable  whereas we continue to recognize incremental fees in arrears once our clients contractually report them to us  because the incremental fees are not determinable until reported 
the impact of this change for was an increase to term license revenue of approximately  for existing term license arrangements signed prior to which are in their second or third year where we had previously begun billing in arrears of the measurement period  we will continue to recognize revenue for the minimum and incremental value of the aua fees upon receipt of the customer s aua report 
if a customer purchased our software and chose to enter into a soft dollar arrangement through a third party broker dealer  the original payment terms apply  regardless of the arrangement with the third party broker dealer 
the option to soft dollar a transaction does not alter the underlying revenue recognition for the transaction  all the revenue recognition criteria listed in the software licenses section above must be assessed in determining how the revenue will be recognized 
maintenance and other recurring revenues 
we offer annual maintenance programs on perpetual licenses that provide for technical support and updates to our software products 
maintenance fees are bundled with perpetual license fees in the initial licensing year and charged separately for renewals of annual maintenance in subsequent years 
fair value for maintenance is based upon either renewal rates stated in the contracts or separate sales of renewals to customers 
generally  we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the contract term 
we offer other recurring revenue services that are either subscription based or transaction based  and primarily include the provision of software interfaces to  and the capability to download securities information from  third party data providers 
we recognize revenue from recurring revenue transactions either ratably over the subscription period or as the transactions occur based on the terms of the arrangement 
professional services and other revenues 
we offer a variety of professional services that include project management  implementation  data conversion  integration  custom report writing and training 
we base fair value for professional services upon separate sales of these services to customers 
our professional services are generally billed based on hourly rates together with reimbursement for travel and accommodation expenses 
we recognize revenue as professional services are performed  except in the case of multi year term license contracts which are described in the term licenses section above 
certain professional services arrangements involve acceptance criteria and in these cases  revenue and related expenses are recognized upon acceptance 
professional services and other revenues also include revenue from our user conferences 
directly related expenses 
when we defer service revenues  we also defer the direct costs incurred in the delivery of those services to the extent those costs are recoverable through the future revenues on non cancelable contracts as prepaid contract expense 
we recognize those deferred costs as costs of professional services revenues proportionally and over the same period that the deferred revenue is recognized as service revenue 
when we defer license revenue  we defer the direct incremental costs incurred as a result of selling the contract ie sales commissions earned by the salesforce as a part of their overall compensation because those costs would not have been incurred but for the acquisition of that contract 
we recognize those costs as sales and marketing expense proportionally and over the same period as the license revenues 
income taxes 
we account for worldwide income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities to be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
many of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that have differing or preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions to reasonably allocate earnings 
additionally  the projections of pre tax income for the year by legal entity can vary significantly from quarter to quarter which can have a significant impact on our projected effective tax rate 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable  the final outcome could be different from that which is reflected in our income tax provision and accruals 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdiction where the tax asset is located 
we consider forecasted earnings  future taxable income and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the return is filed and the tax implication is known 
we are subject to audits by state  federal and foreign tax authorities 
our estimates for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax matter are judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities 
stock based compensation 
the adoption of sfas r on january  had a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
see note  stock based compensation  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our stock based compensation including pro forma disclosures for prior periods as if we had recorded stock based compensation expense 
the calculation of stock based compensation requires reliance on significant assumptions  judgments and estimates 
management judgment was required in the initial selection and implementation of policies to conform with the requirements of sfas r 
management elected to adopt the standard using the modified prospective method  to utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of expense and to recognize the stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period 
had management selected other implementation  valuation or recognition methodologies  the presented results could vary significantly 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options  stock appreciation rights sar and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise behavior  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use an external service provider to assist us in making reasonable estimates 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock based on an equally weighted average of historical and implied volatility of the company s common stock 
we determined that a blend of historical and implied volatility is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility 
we estimate the expected life of options and sars granted based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
we base the risk free interest rate on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option and sar 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
these variables are sensitive and change on a daily basis 
as a result  the financial result from issuing the same number of options or sars can vary significantly over time 
the following table reflects the change in the fair value of a hypothetical option or sar as a result of a hypothetical change in one of the underlying assumptions assumption base case assumption change value change assumption change value change grant and stock price risk free interest rate volatility expected life years year year expected dividend yield base option value our sar and stock option awards granted to employees cliff vest after one year and monthly thereafter over the next months 
our restricted stock unit rsu awards cliff vest after two years and after four years 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on our annual forfeiture rate 
the annual forfeiture rate is based on our historical forfeiture experience over the last ten years 
we use an external service provider to assist us in making reasonable estimates of the annual forfeiture rate 
during the third quarter of  we modified our forfeiture calculation for rsu awards to better reflect both the recent experience with rsu forfeitures and to reflect the longer cliff vesting periods 
the effect of these modifications was to reduce stock based compensation expense by  during restructuring charges and related accruals 
since  we have developed and implemented formalized plans for restructuring our business to better align our resources to market conditions and recorded significant charges 
in connection with these plans  we recorded estimated expenses for severance and benefits  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
business combinations 
when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
goodwill 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as of november and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we had three reporting units as of november  the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of our reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including the development of future revenue and expense forecasts used to calculate future cash flows  the selection of risk adjusted discount rates  and determination of market comparable entities 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment test which did not indicate impairment for any of our reporting units 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our other long lived assets including property and equipment and other intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
determining whether an impairment trigger has occurred is subjective and requires judgment 
our recoverability test compares the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
we estimate future revenue and expense amounts to calculate future cash flows 
we believe our forecast revenue and expense amounts are reasonable but forecast amounts are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
legal contingencies 
from time to time  advent is involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we use our judgment to assess both the likelihood and potential amount of a contingency 
we periodically review our assessment whenever there is a change in the facts and circumstances of these proceedings 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future 
were an unfavorable outcome to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs  and potentially in future periods 
sales returns and accounts receivable allowances 
our standard practice is to enforce our contract terms and not allow our customers to return software 
we have  however  allowed customers to return software on a limited case by case basis and have recorded sales returns provisions as offsets to revenue in the period the sales return becomes probable 
we use our judgment in estimating our sales returns 
we analyze customer demand  acceptance of products and historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which are not generally provided to customers 
beginning in  we used an algorithm to supplement our judgment for calculating the value of reserves that considered the last months of experience into account 
beginning in the second quarter of  we changed our algorithm to include the last months of return experience 
our ability to estimate returns is based on our long history of experience with relatively homogenous transactions and the fact that the return period is short 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors 
we have recorded a sales returns provision benefit to decrease increase revenue for these situations based on our historical experience of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we use our judgment in estimating our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in order to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific accounts receivables  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we have recorded a provision for reduction of bad debt of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
reclassifications certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation to better reflect our view of the current business 
these reclassifications do not affect total net revenues  net income  cash flows  or stockholders equity 
please refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for a complete description of the reclassifications 
results of operations for fiscal years  and the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  certain items in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues 
the financial information and the ensuing discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
fiscal years net revenues term license  maintenance and other recurring perpetual license fees professional services and other total net revenues cost of revenues term license  maintenance and other recurring perpetual license fees professional services and other amortization of developed technology total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing product development general and administrative amortization of other intangibles acquired in process research and development restructuring charges total operating expenses income loss from operations interest expense interest income and other  net gain on sale of equity investments income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income less than net revenues in thousands  except percentages total net revenues    change over prior year   percent change over prior year our net revenues are made up of three components term license  maintenance and other recurring revenue  perpetual license fees  and professional services and other revenue 
term license fees include both the software license fees and maintenance fees recorded under a time based contract 
maintenance revenues are derived from maintenance fees charged for perpetual license arrangements and recurring revenues are derived from our subscription based or transaction based services 
perpetual license revenues are derived from the licensing of software products under a perpetual arrangement 
professional services and other revenues include fees for consulting  training services  commission revenues from soft dollaring of third party products and services and our client conferences 
sales returns  which we generally do not provide to customers  are accounted for as deductions to these three revenue categories based on our historical experience 
each of the major revenue categories has historically varied as a percentage of net revenues  and we expect this variability to continue in the near term 
this variability is primarily due to the introduction of new products and subscription services  the relative size and timing of individual perpetual software license sales  as well as the size and timing of completion of term license implementations 
as we continue to transition the substantial majority of our license agreements to term  we expect our revenue from recurring sources to continue to increase as a percentage of net revenues 
when the transition is substantially complete  we expect less variability between our major categories of revenues because the variation from large perpetual license deals will decrease 
net revenues increased in and due to growing information technology spending by our customers  as well as a general increase in customer adoption for many of our products and services  including principally substantial increases in sales of our apx and geneva products 
during  we sold apx licenses and added new geneva clients the year over year growth in net revenues included large increases in term license  maintenance and recurring revenues  as well as a increase in revenue from international sales 
international sales  which are based on the location to which the product is shipped  also contributed to our growth in and and were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we plan to continue expanding our international growth  both in our current markets and elsewhere  and we expect revenue growth in emea in to be consistent with our overall revenue growth 
the revenues from customers in any single international country did not exceed of total net revenues 
going forward  we expect normal seasonal weakness to impact revenues and bookings in the first quarter of  followed by modest growth as the year progresses resulting in expected net revenues to be in the range of million to million for the fiscal year term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues in thousands  except percentages term license revenues    maintenance revenues    other recurring revenues    total term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues percent of total net revenues change over prior year   percent change over prior year term license revenues  which include software license and maintenance fees for term licenses  grew in from and represented of total term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues in  up from in and in we began our transition to a term licensing model in which has resulted in the subsequent growth of term license revenues as we sign more contracts on a term basis 
the increases reflected the continued market acceptance of our geneva  apx  partner and moxy products 
maintenance revenues increased by million and million during and  respectively 
these increases were attributable to the impact of price increases on annual perpetual maintenance renewals purchased by our installed customer base  up selling to higher value maintenance plans and  to a lesser extent  an increase in new perpetual maintenance support contracts  partially offset by maintenance de activations and downgrades  and perpetual license customers migrating to term licenses 
we disclose our maintenance renewal rate one quarter in arrears in order to include substantially all payments received against the maintenance invoices for that quarter 
our maintenance renewal rate has been in the range of to over the previous four quarters and was for the third quarter of other recurring revenues increased million and million during and  respectively  mainly as a result of growth in our subscription  data management revenue streams and outsourced services including advent back office service abos and advent custodial data acd 
as a percentage of total net revenues  total term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues increased to during from and in and  respectively 
these increases as a percentage of total net revenues were attributable to the continued emphasis in term license sales relative to perpetual license sales 
we expect term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues to be up significantly in amount and as a percentage of total net revenues in as we have reached the turning point in our transition to a term model and expect to grow license revenues compared to due principally to continued bookings of both term and some perpetual licenses and recognition of term license revenue deferred in prior years 
as we sell more products on a term license model  we defer a greater portion of license revenue over the term of the contract  instead of recognizing the license revenue up front 
the net effect  assuming most customers renew their contracts upon expiration of the initial term  is to build a long term license and maintenance stream and also enhance predictability of license revenues

in addition  our microedge subsidiary  which continues to sell a majority of its products under a perpetual license model  recorded perpetual license fees of million  an increase of million or over and reflecting strong growth of its core product gifts

professional services projects related to axys  moxy and partner products generally can be completed in a two to six month time period  while services related to geneva and apx products may require a four to nine month implementation period 
professional services recorded revenue of million  an increase over the increase was a reflection of growth in our consulting  project management  data conversion and custom reporting revenues associated with implementations of our apx and geneva products 
the increase was partially offset by a increase in the net deferral of professional services revenue for services performed on term license implementations 
when services are performed with term license implementations  service revenue is deferred until the implementation is complete 
then service revenues are recognized over the remaining license term 
we have experienced an increase in implementation services after the launch of our apx product and the sales success of our geneva product  which are both sold under a term license model 
we deferred net professional services revenue of million in  compared to the revenue deferral of million in the decrease in professional services and other revenues of million in from was primarily attributable to the net deferral of professional services revenue for services performed on term license implementations 
there were more term license implementation projects in progress as of december  compared with the prior year  and as a result there was a significant increase in the deferral of professional services revenue 
we deferred net professional services revenues of approximately million in as compared to million in in addition  revenues earned from third party products paid for through soft dollar transactions decreased due to fewer transactions as we completed the wind down of the soft dollar component of second street securities in the fourth quarter of we expect that professional services and other revenues will increase in as we expect to add more billable headcount to support project implementation growth  and we expect to recognize revenue from term deals signed in upon their completion of implementation during revenues by segment in thousands advent investment management    microedge    other  total    we have two reportable segments advent investment management aim and microedge

the and increases in aim s revenues in fiscal and  respectively  reflected the improved economic conditions and growth in the financial markets  increased international sales as well as the continued market acceptance of our axys  apx  moxy  partner and geneva products 
aim s revenue increases in and also reflected an increase in new maintenance support contracts as a result of new license deals  up selling existing customers to higher value maintenance plans and price increases for maintenance contracts from our installed customer base  partially offset by attrition from within our existing installed customer base 
we also had growth in international sales in in and our assets under administration revenues increased by million and million in and  respectively  as a result of the growth in assets under administration for our fund administration clients 
the technology spending patterns of organizations in microedge s primary markets independent foundations  community foundations and corporations are directly affected by economic fluctuations as foundation budgets are largely driven by endowment income 
given that endowments often contain market exposed components  they are significantly affected by the economy and foundation spending typically decreases in an economic downturn 
community foundations are subject to similar influences  compounded by the fact that in many cases much of their ongoing funding and endowment comes from active donors who may increase or reduce their giving depending on the economic climate and the related effect on their income and wealth 
corporations typically fund charitable activities from operating budgets  and the allocation to charitable donations and supporting company charitable operations is often closely tied to a company s performance 
thus  corporate philanthropy and spending on related technology are correlated with company and overall economic performance 
the and increases in microedge revenues in fiscal and  respectively  primarily reflected an increase in perpetual license sales in microedge s core product gifts and to a lesser extent maintenance revenues due to price increases and continued strong customer retention

payroll related expenses increased as a result of an increase in headcount 
as a result of the increases in our license transactions and customer base in  we have increased headcount in our client services and consulting groups to at december  from at december   and at december  the increase in also reflected an increase in stock based compensation expense of million due to the adoption of sfas r on january  higher utilization of outside services  including third parties to assist in our professional service projects  also contributed to the overall cost increase during and in addition  travel expenses increased due to travel associated with more professional service projects 
consistent with the increase in headcount  recruiting costs increased during fiscal and we have experienced an increase in implementation services with the launch of our apx product and sales of our geneva product  which are both sold under the term license model 
as there were more term license implementation projects  primarily geneva related  in progress as of december  compared to the previous two years  we have experienced an increase in the deferral of professional service costs during the past two years 
we deferred net professional service costs of million during compared to million and million during and  respectively 
gross margins for professional services in and continue to be negative as a result of the significant deferral of professional services revenues and costs associated with our term license implementation 
we defer only the direct costs associated with services performed on these arrangements 
indirect costs such as management and other overhead expenses are recognized in the period in which they are incurred  with no revenue to offset them 
in addition  we have added headcount in our consulting group 
since these new employees undergo a training period  typically of six months  before becoming fully billable  their associated costs have a near term negative impact on gross margins 
we expect cost of professional services and other in to increase in dollar amount but not as a percentage of revenue as compared to  primarily as we expect to add more billable headcount to support project implementation growth

the increases in payroll and related expense were a result of an increase in headcount to at december  from and at december  and  respectively  and increases in variable compensation paid to these individuals as a result of higher bookings 
we believe this investment in personnel will accelerate the momentum in our geneva and apx product sales and increase customer satisfaction for all of our products 
additionally  an increase in stock based compensation expense of million contributed to the increase in payroll and related increase in as we adopted fas r on january  travel expenses increased due to more employees attending our annual advent client conference resulting in higher travel and lodging costs 
marketing and outside services expense increased due to increased advertising initiatives to market our significant number of product releases for the fluctuations in broker fees and bad debt expense during fiscal and were primarily associated with the winding down of our soft dollar business in fiscal in  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in dollar amount but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total net revenues compared with  as we increase our marketing activities in support of planned product launches and additions to the sales force

the headcount increase to at december  from at december  reflected our investment in information technology infrastructure to assist in automating key business processes to support the company s growth 
as a result of the increase in headcount  general and administrative incurred additional costs from recruiting costs 
additionally  our loss on disposal of assets during increased primarily from the write off of construction in progress assets at our second street facility in san francisco  california  as a result of our decision to cease improvement on the facility and relocate this data center 
these increases in expense were offset by a decrease in facilities and depreciation expense as we are no longer incurring rent and depreciation expenses related to our prior san francisco headquarters facility located at brannan street  which we exited in october we entered into a definitive lease agreement in january for our new headquarters facility located at townsend street in san francisco  california resulting in rent expense at both townsend and our prior headquarters facility causing higher rent expense for the first nine months of outside service costs decreased by million in as fewer external consultants were used during the current year 
lower legal fees and professional fees resulted from decreased services provided by sarbanes oxley compliance consultants  and external legal and accounting firms 
during  we allocated payroll and related costs for certain it personnel to sales and marketing expense and cost of professional services as these it employees were working on projects specifically relating to these functions 
the overall fluctuations were also attributable to a decrease in legal fees of in as compared to fiscal which included costs for various legal disputes 
a decrease in depreciation expense of million for also contributed to the overall decrease in general and administrative expense which primarily resulted from assets being fully depreciated in outside service costs decreased by million in as fewer external consultants were used during these decreases were offset by an increase in payroll and related costs primarily due to stock based compensation expense of million or of total net revenues during  and an increase in rent expense of approximately million

in the fourth quarter of  we determined that million of our deferred tax assets  including million related to goodwill  that had previously been offset with a valuation allowance would more likely than not be realized in the foreseeable future 
the million reduction to our valuation allowance that generated an income tax benefit was partially offset by income tax accruals of million and resulted in a net benefit from income taxes of million in our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to the favorable effects of federal and state research credits and the release of valuation allowance relating to capital loss carryovers that were utilized in to offset unanticipated capital gains 
these favorable effects were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of stock compensation expense relating to incentive stock options and the company s employee stock purchase plan 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets relating to capital loss carryovers and investment reserves and assorted state net operating losses because the likelihood of their realization is not more likely than not 
we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to be in the range of to of profit before taxes

our cash provided by operating activities generally follows the trend in our net revenues and operating results 
cash provided by operating activities of million during fiscal was primarily the result of our net income of million  increase in deferred revenues of million  and non cash expenses including stock based compensation of million and depreciation and amortization of million  partially offset by a net gain from equity investment activity of million 
the increase in deferred revenue primarily reflected our continued transition to the term license model 
under the term license model  we generally bill and collect for a term agreement in installments in advance of each annual period 
these amounts are deferred at billing and recognized over the annual term period 
this has the effect of increasing deferred revenue when compared to a perpetual license model where no license revenue is deferred 
see further discussion of the effects of our transition to a term model in the overview section 
cash provided by operating activities of million during fiscal primarily consisted of our income before tax of million and adjustments to reconcile net income to cash flow from operating activities driven by non cash charges including stock based compensation of million  and depreciation and amortization of million 
cash flows resulting from changes in assets and liabilities included increases in deferred revenue of million  accrued liabilities of million and income taxes payable of million 
the increase in accrued liabilities primarily reflected increases in accrued bonuses and restructuring expenses relating to the relocation of our corporate headquarters

cash flows resulting from changes in assets and liabilities included increases in accrued liabilities of million and deferred revenues of million 
the increase in accrued liabilities primarily reflected increases in accrued bonuses and accrued legal fees 
the increase in deferred revenues reflected new maintenance contracts  existing maintenance contracts renewed at higher prices  and more contracts signed on a term model 
these sources of cash were offset by net non operating gains on investments of million primarily resulting from a gain on sale of a private equity investment of million and decreases in deferred income taxes of million and income taxes payable of million 
the decrease in deferred income taxes reflected the amortization of foreign deferred tax liabilities 
the decrease in income taxes payable reflected the payment of a tax settlement 
other major uses of our operating cash including funding payroll salaries  bonuses and benefits and general operating expenses marketing  travel  computer and telecommunications  legal and professional expenses  and office rent 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our net revenues and operating results  the amount of revenue deferred resulting from our shift to a term license model  collection of accounts receivable  and timing of payments 
we expect operating cash flow to be between million to million for fiscal cash flows from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities in of million is primarily from proceeds of million from the sale of short term investments and from the proceeds of million from the sale of two private equity investments  including our stake in latentzero limited 
this was partially offset by capital expenditures of million  cash used for the acquisitions of vivid orange and east circle solutions totaling million  capitalized software development costs of million and a change in restricted cash of million to increase the bank letter of credit associated with lease amendments for our headquarters facility in san francisco  california

we plan to build out additional space in our headquarters facility in san francisco and make information technology investments 
we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities in of million reflected the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million and the repayment of million on our credit facility 
these cash outlays were partially offset by the draw down of million against our credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of our common stock of million under our employee stock option and purchase plans

our liquidity and capital resources in any period could be affected by the exercise of outstanding stock options and sars  and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares from this and from the issuance of common stock from our rsus could also affect our per share results of operations 
however  we cannot predict the timing or amount of proceeds from the exercise of these securities  or whether they will be exercised at all 
at december   we had negative working capital of million  down from working capital of million at december   primarily as a result of our common stock repurchases totaling million during  and to a lesser extent deferred revenue growth as we continue to transition the substantial majority of our license agreements to term 
in february  advent software  inc and certain of our domestic subsidiaries entered into a senior secured credit facility agreement the credit facility with wells fargo foothill  inc the lender 
under the credit facility  the lender will provide the company with a revolving line of credit up to an aggregate amount of million  subject to a borrowing base formula  to provide backup liquidity for general corporate purposes  including stock repurchases  or investment opportunities for a period of three years 
we expect that for the next year our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of cash 
in addition  we may use cash to fund acquisitions  repurchase common stock  or invest in other businesses  when opportunities arise 
based upon the predominance of our revenues from recurring sources  bookings performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases and financing activities for the next year 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we currently have no significant capital commitments other than commitments under our operating leases  which increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily as a result of several amendments executed to the lease agreement for our townsend street headquarters facility whereby the company leased additional facility space of  square feet during the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands fiscal years thereafter total operating lease obligations  net of sub lease income      at december   we had a gross liability of million for uncertain tax positions associated with the adoption of fin since almost all of this liability relates to reserves against deferred tax assets that we do not expect to utilize in the short term  we cannot estimate the timing of potential future cash settlements and have not included any estimates in the table of contractual cash obligations above 
additionally  our cash payments for income taxes will continue to be nominal over the next few years as we have significant net operating losses  capital losses and tax credit carryforwards to utilize 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
historically  much of our revenues and capital spending was transacted in us dollars 
however  since the acquisitions of advent denmark  advent norway  advent sweden  advent netherlands  and advent europe s remaining distributors in the united kingdom and switzerland  whose service and certain license revenues and capital spending  are transacted in local country currencies  we have greater exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally as of december   million and million of goodwill and intangibles from the acquisition of these entities are denominated in foreign currency 
therefore a hypothetical change of could increase or decrease our assets and equity by million 
we do not believe that a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows 
our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash equivalents as of december  these cash equivalent securities were comprised of us government debt securities which would not be materially affected by an immediate sharp increase or decrease in interest rates 
as of december   advent did not hold any auction rate securities and does not plan to hold them in the near future 
during  we liquidated our marketable securities portfolio to fund our stock repurchase program resulting in a zero balance at december  effective february  we also have interest rate risk relating to debt under our credit facility which is indexed to libor or a wells fargo prime rate 
however  as of december   we essentially have no exposure for market risk for changes in interest rates associated with our facility  as we have a zero balance of debt at december  we have also invested in several privately held companies 
these non marketable investments are classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
our investments in privately held companies could be affected by an adverse movement in the financial markets for publicly traded equity securities  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products these privately held companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
it is our policy to review investments in privately held companies on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
our investments in privately held companies are assessed for impairment when a review of the investee s operations indicates that a decline in value of the investment is other than temporary 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  limited capital resources  limited prospects of receiving additional financing  and prospects for liquidity of the related securities 
impaired investments in privately held companies are written down to estimated fair value 
we estimate fair value using a variety of valuation methodologies 
such methodologies include comparing the private company with publicly traded companies in similar lines of business  applying revenue and price earnings multiples to estimated future operating results for the private company and estimating discounted cash flows for that company 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
during the second quarter of  we sold two of our investments  including our investment in latentzero limited  and impaired another 
at december   our net investments in privately held companies totaled million
