item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report 
all share and per share information has been restated to give effect to a two for one common stock split that became effective november  we are a diversified insurance agency  wholesale brokerage and services organization headquartered in daytona beach and tampa  florida 
since  our stated corporate objective has been to increase our net income per share by at least every year 
we have increased revenues from million in as originally stated  without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting to million in  a compound annual growth rate of 
in the same period  we increased net income from million as originally stated  without giving effect to any subsequent acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting to million in  a compound annual growth rate of 
since  excluding the historical impact of poolings  our pre tax margins income before income taxes and minority interest divided by total revenues improved in all but one year  and in that year  the pre tax margin was essentially flat 
these improvements have resulted primarily from net new business growth new business production offset by lost business  revenues generated by acquisitions  continued operating efficiencies and for  the sale of our investment in rock tenn company 
unlike our prior year s results  our revenue growth in was driven primarily by the acquisition of agency entities and several books of business customer accounts generating total annualized revenues of approximately million 
our commissions and fees revenue is comprised of commissions paid by insurance companies and fees paid directly by customers 
commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by the insured and are materially affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds underlying insurable exposure units  which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk such as property values  sales and payroll levels so as to determine what premium to charge the insured 
these premium rates are established by insurance companies based upon many factors  including reinsurance rates paid by insurance carriers  none of which we control 
beginning in and continuing through  commission revenues were adversely influenced by a consistent decline in premium rates resulting from intense competition among property and casualty insurance companies for market share 
this condition of a prevailing decline in premium rates  commonly referred to as a soft market  generally resulted in flat to reduced commissions on renewal business 
the effect of this softness in rates on our commission revenues was somewhat offset by our acquisitions and net new business production 
as a result of increasing loss ratios the comparison of incurred losses plus adjustment expenses against earned premiums of insurance companies through  there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of and continuing into during  the increases in premium rates began to decline  and in certain lines of insurance  premium rates decreased 
in  as general premium rates continued to moderate  the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season since when hurricane andrew hit south florida 
the insured losses from the hurricane season were absorbed relatively easily by the insurance industry and the general insurance premium rates continued to soften during during the third quarter of  the insurance industry experienced the worst hurricane season ever recorded 
as a result of the significant losses incurred by the insurance carriers as the result of these hurricanes  the insurance premium rates in increased on coastal property  primarily in the southeastern region of the united states 
in the other regions of the united states  the insurance premium rates  in general  declined during in addition to significant insurance pricing declines in the state of florida  as previously discussed  the insurance premium rates continued a gradual decline during in most of the other regions of the united states 
one industry segment that was especially hit hard during was the home building industry in southern california  and to a lesser extent nevada  arizona and florida 
we have a wholesale brokerage operation that focus on placing property and casualty insurance products for that home building segment and a program operation that places errors and omissions professional liability coverages for title agents 
both of these operations revenues were negatively impacted by these national economic trends 
the volume of business from new and existing insured customers  fluctuations in insurable exposure units and changes in general economic and competitive conditions further impact our revenues 
for example  the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage 
conversely  level rates of inflation or general declines in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units 
historically  our revenues have continued to grow as a result of an intense focus on net new business growth and acquisitions  however was highlighted by very substantial governmental involvement in the florida insurance marketplace that resulted in a substantial loss of revenues see the business section of this annual report on form k for further discussion of citizens and its effect on our results of operations 
we anticipate that results of operations will continue to be influenced by these competitive and economic conditions in we also earn profit sharing contingent commissions  which are profit sharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results  but may also reflect considerations for volume  growth and or retention 
these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year  based on underwriting results and other aforementioned considerations for the prior year s 
over the last three years profit sharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately of the previous year s total commissions and fees revenue 
profit sharing contingent commissions are primarily included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of income in the year received 
the term core commissions and fees excludes profit sharing contingent commissions and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold  and specific fee based services rendered 
recently  three national insurance companies announced the replacement of the current loss ratio based profit sharing contingent commission calculation with a more guaranteed fixed based methodology  referred to as guaranteed supplemental commissions gsc 
since these new gsc are not subject to the uncertainty of loss ratios  they are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written 
as of december   million was accrued for gsc earned during  but which will not be collected until the first quarter of fee revenues are generated primarily by our services division  which provides insurance related services  including third party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers compensation and all lines liability arenas  as well as medicare set aside services  and our wholesale brokerage and national program divisions which earn fees primarily for the issuing of insurance policies on behalf of insurance carriers 
in each of the past three years  fee revenues have increased as a percentage of our total commissions and fees  from in to in investment income  historically  consists primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies 
our policy is to invest available funds in high quality  short term fixed income investment securities 
investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments 
in  we sold our investment in rock tenn company which we have owned for over years  for a net gain of million 
acquisitions during  we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of insurance intermediary operations  the stock of three insurance intermediaries and several books of business customer accounts 
the aggregate purchase price was million  including million of net cash payments  the issuance of million in notes payable and the assumption of million of liabilities 
these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of million 
during  we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of insurance intermediary operations and several books of business customer accounts 
the aggregate purchase price was million  including million of net cash payments  the issuance of million in notes payable and the assumption of million of liabilities 
these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of million 
during  we acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of insurance intermediary operations and several books of business customer accounts 
the aggregate purchase price was million  including million of net cash payments  the issuance of million in notes payable and the assumption of million of liabilities 
these acquisitions had estimated aggregate annualized revenues of million 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we continually evaluate our estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities  which values are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is billed to the customer  whichever is later 
at that date  the earnings process has been completed  and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly 
management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted by known circumstances 
subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon notification from the insurance companies 
profit sharing contingent commissions from insurance companies are recognized when determinable  which is when such commissions are received  or when officially notified 
fee revenues are recognized as services are rendered 
business combinations and purchase price allocations we have significant intangible assets that were acquired through business acquisitions 
these assets consist of purchased customer accounts  noncompete agreements  and the excess of costs over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill 
the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  all of our business combinations initiated after june  have been accounted for using the purchase method 
in connection with these acquisitions  we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased  which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements 
purchased customer accounts partially include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies  customers and other matters essential to policy renewals 
however  they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts 
the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency  expenses and discount rates 
any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts 
noncompete agreements are valued based on the duration and any unique features of each specific agreement 
purchased customer accounts and noncompete agreements are amortized on a straight line basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods  which range from five to years 
the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is no longer amortized  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

intangible assets impairment effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to lower of cost or market impairment testing 
sfas no 
requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
fair value is estimated based on multiples of revenues  and earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill on an annual basis  and of our amortizable intangibles and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  ii significant negative industry or economic trends  iii significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and iv significant decline in our market capitalization 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above referenced factors  an impairment analysis is performed 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to revise the assessment and  if appropriate  record an impairment charge 
we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november  and identified no impairment as a result of the evaluation 
non cash stock based compensation the company grants stock options and non vested stock awards previously referred to as restricted stock to its employees  officers and directors 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  for its stock based compensation plans 
among other things  sfas r requires that compensation expense for all share based awards be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
reserves for litigation we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable  an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
management  with the assistance of inside and outside counsel  determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues 
new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and impact our net income 
derivative instruments in  we entered into one derivative financial instrument an interest rate exchange agreement  or swap to manage the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our million variable rate debt 
as of december   we maintained this swap agreement  whereby we pay a fixed rate on the notional amount to a bank and the bank pays us a variable rate on the notional amount equal to a base london interbank offering rate libor 
we have assessed this derivative as a highly effective cash flow hedge  and accordingly  changes in the fair market value of the swap are reflected in other comprehensive income 
the fair market value of this instrument is determined by quotes obtained from the related counter parties in combination with a valuation model utilizing discounted cash flows 
the valuation of this derivative instrument is a significant estimate that is largely affected by changes in interest rates 
as of december  this interest rate swap agreement expired in conjunction with the final payment on the related million variable rate debt 
new accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting standards 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
financial information relating to our consolidated financial results is as follows in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change revenues commissions and fees profit sharing contingent commissions investment income other income  net total revenues expenses employee compensation and benefits non cash stock based compensation other operating expenses amortization depreciation interest total expenses income before income taxes net internal growth rate core commissions and fees employee compensation and benefits ratio other operating expenses ratio capital expenditures total assets at december commissions and fees commissions and fees revenue  including profit sharing contingent commissions  increased in  in and in profit sharing contingent commissions increased million to million in and million to million in  primarily as a result of a better than average year for insurance companies loss ratios 
core commissions and fees revenue decreased in and increased in and in  when excluding commissions and fees revenue generated from acquired operations and also from divested operations 
the decrease of represents million of net lost core commission and fees revenue  of which million is related to our various operations impacted by the florida insurance marketplace  million is related to our operation that serves the home building industry in southern california  with our remaining operations at a minimal aggregate revenue growth 
investment income investment income increased to million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in over of million was primarily due to the sale of our investment in rock tenn company which we owned for over years  for a net gain of million 
the increase in over was primarily the result of higher investment yields earned with higher average available cash balances 
other income  net other income consists primarily of gains and losses from the sale and disposition of assets 
in  gains of million were recognized from the sale of books of business customer accounts as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
although we are not in the business of selling books of businesses customer accounts  we periodically will sell an office or a book of business one or more customer accounts that does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth 
even though the sales of customer accounts were unusually high during  we do not believe that it is indicative of a future trend 
employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits increased approximately or million in  of which million was related to acquisitions that were stand alone offices 
of the remaining million  the majority related to the average annual salary increase given to non producer employees 
additionally  during  million of the increase related to a funding true up to the employee profit sharing contribution 
employee compensation and benefits increased approximately in and in  primarily as a result of acquisitions and an increase in commissions paid on net new business 
employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of total revenues were in and in  reflecting a gradual improvement in personnel efficiencies as revenues grow 
we had  full time equivalent employees at december   compared with  at december  and  at december  of the net increase in full time equivalent employees at december  over the prior year end  were from the acquisitions that were stand alone offices  thus resulting in a net reduction of employees in the offices existing at both year ends 
non cash stock based compensation the company grants stock options and non vested stock awards to its employees  officers and directors 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  for its stock based compensation plans 
among other things  sfas r requires that compensation expense for all share based awards be recognized in the financial statements based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
prior to january   the company accounted for stock based compensation using the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations  and disclosure requirements established by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transitions and disclosures sfas 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense was recognized for either stock options issued under the company s stock compensation plans or for stock purchased under the company s employee stock purchase plan espp 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share for stock options and espp awards were instead disclosed in a footnote to the financial statements 
compensation expense was previously recognized for awards of non vested stock  based upon the market value of the common stock on the date of award  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period with the effect of forfeitures recognized as they occurred 
as such the non cash stock based compensation expense of million was solely related to the performance stock plan psp grants under apb for and  the non cash stock based compensation under sfas r incorporates costs related to each of our three stock based plans as explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
since the last significant company wide grants of psp shares occurred in january and that the five year period for the related shares to become awarded expired in january as did the unawarded shares  we expect to grant new psp shares to deserving office leaders and producers in february additionally  we may issue incentive stock options iso to certain corporate leaders 
the expected annual cost of these additional psp and iso grants is expected to be between million and million 
other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues  other operating expenses was in  in and in other operating expenses in increased million over the amount which also included a one time million payment to the state of florida described below  therefore having an effective increase in cost of million 
the intermediaries acquired in that were not combined with existing company offices and became stand alone offices  accounted for million of the million net increase 
thus  excluding the effects of acquisitions  the other operating expenses were slightly less than for  legal and professional fee expenses increased million over the amount expended in the increase in legal and professional fee expenses was primarily the result of the various ongoing investigations and litigation relating to agent and broker compensation  including profit sharing contingent commissions  by state regulators and  to a lesser extent  by the requirements of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of additionally  in a total of million was paid to state of florida regulatory authorities and other parties  which concluded the state of florida s investigation of compensation paid to us see note 
excluding the impact of these increased legal and professional fee expenses and settlement payments  other operating expenses declined as a percentage of total revenues each year from to  which is attributable to the effective cost containment measures brought about by our initiative designed to identify areas of excess expense 
this decrease is also due to the fact that  in a net internal revenue growth environment  certain significant other operating expenses such as office rent  office supplies  data processing  and telephone costs  increase at a slower rate than commissions and fees revenue during the same period 
amortization amortization expense increased million  or in  million  or in  and million  or in the increases in and were due to the amortization of additional intangible assets as a result of acquisitions completed in those years 
depreciation depreciation increased in  in and in these increases were primarily due to the purchase of new computers  related equipment and software  corporate aircraft and the depreciation of fixed assets associated with acquisitions completed in those years 
interest expense interest expense increased million or  in over primarily as a result of the additional million that was borrowed in december but which was partially offset by the reduction in the term loan balance due to the normal quarterly principal payments 
interest expense decreased million  or  in over as a result of lower average debt balances due to the normal quarterly principal payments 
income taxes the effective tax rate on income from operations was in  in and in the higher effective tax rate in and  compared with  was primarily the result of increased amounts of business conducted in states having higher state tax rates and a million settlement payment to the us internal revenue service irs in during  the irs concluded their audit of our tax years in which they disputed our method of recognizing profit sharing contingent commissions for tax purposes 
we recognize profit sharing contingent commissions when determinable  which is when such commissions are received  however  the irs believes that we should estimate those monies as of each december we agreed to resolve this dispute for a million payment of interest and our agreement to accrue at each december  for tax purposes only  a known amount of profit sharing contingent commissions represented by the actual amount of profit sharing contingent commissions received in the first quarter of the related year  with a true up adjustment to the actual amount received by the end of the following march since this method for tax purposes differs from the method used for book purposes  it will result in a current deferred tax asset as of december each year with that balance reversing by the following march when the related profit sharing contingent commissions are recognized for financial accounting purposes 
results of operations segment information as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we operate in four reportable segments the retail  wholesale brokerage  national programs and services divisions 
on a divisional basis  increases in amortization  depreciation and interest expenses are the result of acquisitions within a given division in a particular year 
likewise  other income in each division primarily reflects net gains on sales of customer accounts and fixed assets 
as such  in evaluating the operational efficiency of a division  management places emphasis on the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue  the gradual improvement of the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues  and the gradual improvement of the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues 
the internal growth rates for our core commissions and fees for the three years ended december   and  by divisional units are as follows in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  total net change total net growth less acquisition revenues internal net growth internal net growth florida retail national retail western retail total retail wholesale brokerage professional programs special programs total national programs services total core commissions and fees the reconciliation of the above internal growth schedule to the total commissions and fees included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and is as follows in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  total core commissions and fees profit sharing contingent commissions divested business total commission fees for the years ended december  total net change total net growth less acquisition revenues internal net growth internal net growth florida retail national retail western retail total retail wholesale brokerage professional programs special programs total national programs services total core commissions and fees the reconciliation of the above internal growth schedule to the total commissions and fees included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and is as follows in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  total core commissions and fees profit sharing contingent commissions divested business total commission fees for the years ended december  total net change total net growth less acquisition revenues internal net growth internal net growth florida retail national retail western retail total retail wholesale brokerage professional programs special programs total national programs services total core commissions and fees the reconciliation of the above internal growth schedule to the total commissions and fees included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and is as follows in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  total core commissions and fees profit sharing contingent commissions divested business total commission fees the retail segment includes commissions and fees reported in the other column of the segment information in note which includes corporate and consolidation items 
retail division the retail division provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial  public and quasi public  professional and individual insured customers 
more than of the retail division s commissions and fees revenue are commission based 
since the majority of our other operating expenses do not change as premiums fluctuate  we believe that most of any fluctuation in the commissions that we receive will be reflected in our pre tax income 
the retail division s commissions and fees revenue accounted for of our total consolidated commissions and fees revenue in but declined to in  mainly due to continued acquisitions in the national programs and wholesale brokerage divisions 
financial information relating to brown brown s retail division is as follows in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change revenues commissions and fees profit sharing contingent commissions investment income other income  net  nmf  total revenues expenses employee compensation and benefits non cash stock based compensation other operating expenses amortization depreciation interest total expenses income before income taxes net internal growth rate core commissions and fees employee compensation and benefits ratio other operating expenses ratio capital expenditures total assets at december the retail division s total revenues in increased million to million  a increase over of this increase  approximately million was the net growth in core commissions and fees  however  million was from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in  and therefore  million was lost on a same store sales basis resulting in a negative internal growth rate of 
the majority of the negative internal growth resulted from continued competitive insurance pricing in the western united states 
however  the most competitive pricing in the second half of the year occurred in florida  and this insurance pricing environment is likely to continue for at least the first half of income before income taxes in increased million from  of which million was from an historically high amount of gains from the sales of books of business customer accounts 
even though the sales of customer accounts were higher than normal during  we do not believe that it is indicative of a future trend 
the remaining decrease was due the reduced earnings from the negative growth in core commissions and fees  but offset by earnings from acquisitions 
the retail division s total revenues in increased million to million  a increase over of this increase  approximately million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in the remaining increase was primarily due to net new business growth 
the retail division s net internal growth rate in core commissions and fees revenue was in  excluding revenues recognized in from new acquisitions and the commissions and fees revenue from divested business 
the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue for the retail division in was 
the increase in the net internal growth rate from core commission and fees from to primarily reflects increased premium rates for coastal property in the southeastern part of the united states  but offset by lower insurance premium rates in most other parts of the country 
income before income taxes in increased million to million  a increase over this increase was due to revenues from acquisitions  a positive net internal growth rate and the continued focus on holding our general expense growth rate to a lower percentage than our revenue growth rate 
wholesale brokerage division the wholesale brokerage division markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance and reinsurance  primarily through independent agents and brokers 
like the retail and national programs divisions  the wholesale brokerage division s revenues are primarily commission based 
financial information relating to our wholesale brokerage division is as follows in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change revenues commissions and fees profit sharing contingent commissions investment income other income loss  net nmf total revenues expenses employee compensation and benefits non cash stock based compensation other operating expenses amortization depreciation interest total expenses income before income taxes net internal growth rate core commissions and fees employee compensation and benefits ratio other operating expenses ratio capital expenditures total assets at december total revenues in increased million over  of which million was from increased profit sharing contingent commissions and million from core commissions and fees 
profit sharing contingent commissions increased as a result of higher insurance company profitability resulting from the increased premium rates during as well as new profit sharing contingent commissions from operations acquired in of the net increase in core commissions and fees of million  approximately million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in the wholesale brokerage division s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue in was or million less revenues than in  excluding core commissions and fees revenue recognized in from new acquisitions 
the negative internal growth rate for the wholesale brokerage division was primarily the result of the continuation of lost revenues from the same wholesale operations that had the most significant loss of revenues in one of those operations  which focuses on home building construction accounts in the western region of the united states  lost million as a result of the continued slow down in economic activity in that region during the year as well as lower insurance premium rates 
the other significantly affected operation was the florida based wholesale brokerage operations of hull company  which lost million of revenues in as a result of the competitive rate environment created by citizens 
offsetting some of the lost business in florida due to citizens  we did have revenue growth in our binding authority operations and our reinsurance intermediary  axiom re 
income before income taxes in increased million to million  a increase over this increase is attributable in part to the fact that the loss from our reinsurance intermediary was million less than in  and higher earnings from our binding authority operations mainly driven by higher profit sharing contingent commissions 
offsetting these increases  our operation that focuses on home building construction accounts in the western region of the united states had million less income before income taxes than it earned in  due to the reduction of revenues mentioned above 
total revenues in increased million to million  a increase over of this increase  approximately million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in the wholesale brokerage division s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue in was  excluding core commissions and fees revenue recognized in from new acquisitions 
the weaker internal growth rate than in recent years for the wholesale brokerage division was primarily the result of lower revenues from two of our operations 
one of those operations  which focuses on home building construction accounts in the western region of the united states  experienced a slow down in economic activity during the year as well as lower insurance premium rates 
the second operation was the personal lines wholesale brokerage arm of hull company which had significant premium capacity restrictions on placing coastal property coverage with their insurance carriers  which was not the case in income before income taxes in decreased million to million  a decrease over this decrease is attributable in part to axiom re and delaware valley underwriting agency operations acquired in  which had an aggregate loss before income taxes of million as a result of initial transitional issues and net lost business 
additionally  our operation that focuses on home building construction accounts in the western region of the united states had income before income taxes of million less than it earned in  due to the reduction of revenues mentioned above 
offsetting these losses were net increases in income before income taxes from our other wholesale brokerage operations 
national programs division the national programs division is comprised of two units professional programs  which provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents  and special programs  which markets targeted products and services designated for specific industries  trade groups  public and quasi public entities and market niches 
like the retail division  the national programs division s revenues are primarily commission based 
financial information relating to our national programs division is as follows in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change revenues commissions and fees profit sharing contingent commissions investment income other income  net total revenues expenses employee compensation and benefits non cash stock based compensation other operating expenses amortization depreciation interest total expenses income before income taxes net internal growth rate core commissions and fees employee compensation and benefits ratio other operating expenses ratio capital expenditures total assets at december total revenues in were essentially flat compared with due to the netting of different programs  some of which had very good growth and another of which lost nearly half of its revenues in approximately million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in the national program division s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was representing million of lost revenues  excluding core commissions and fees revenue recognized in from new acquisitions 
as previously discussed  when citizens began to compete aggressively in florida on january   it had the greatest impact on our condominium program at our florida intracoastal underwriters fiu profit center 
in  fiu lost million of core commissions and fees of the million of total core commissions and fees that it had earned in most of our other programs  including our lawyers and dentist professional liability programs  our public entity business  our sports and entertainment programs and our proctor financial operation  all had positive internal growth 
since citizen s impact on the insurance rates in florida and on fiu has completed a full twelve month period  and that citizens insurance rates are guaranteed through january   we do not believe that the citizens impact in will be as significant to fiu as it was in income before income taxes in decreased only million from however  excluding the million paid to the state of florida regulatory authorities and other parties in that was allocated to national programs  the net decrease was million 
of that decrease  million was attributable to fiu  which was offset by increased earnings from the acquisitions and the programs that had positive internal growth 
total revenues in increased million to million  a increase over of this increase  approximately million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions for which there were no comparable revenues in the national program division s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was  excluding core commissions and fees revenue recognized in from new acquisitions 
the majority of the internally generated growth in the core commissions and fees revenue was primarily related to increasing insurance premium rates in our condominium program at fiu profit center that occurred as a result of the and hurricane seasons as well as strong growth in the public entity business and the proctor financial operation 
income before income taxes in increased million to million  a increase over  of which the majority related to the revenues derived from acquisitions completed in and the increased earnings at fiu 
additionally  in a total of million was paid to state of florida regulatory authorities and other parties  which concluded the state of florida s investigation of compensation paid to us see note 
of the million  million was allocated to other operating expenses in national programs 
services division the services division provides insurance related services  including third party claims administration tpa and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers compensation and all lines liability arenas  as well as medicare set aside services 
unlike our other segments  approximately of the services division s commissions and fees revenue is generated from fees  which are not significantly affected by fluctuations in general insurance premiums 
financial information relating to our services division is as follows in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change revenues commissions and fees profit sharing contingent commissions investment income other loss income net total revenues expenses employee compensation and benefits non cash stock based compensation other operating expenses amortization depreciation interest nmf total expenses income before income taxes net internal growth rate core commissions and fees employee compensation and benefits ratio other operating expenses ratio capital expenditures total assets at december total revenues in increased million over  of which approximately million related to core commissions and fees revenue from an acquisition for which there was no comparable revenues in the services division s net internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was in  excluding the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions and divested business 
the positive net internal growth rates from core commissions and fees revenue primarily reflect the net new business growth from our medicare secondary payer statute compliance related services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and equity prices 
we are exposed to market risk through our investments  revolving credit line and term loan agreements 
our invested assets are held as cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments  available for sale marketable equity securities  non marketable equity securities and certificates of deposit 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the fair values of our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments  and certificates of deposit at december  and approximated their respective carrying values due to their short term duration and therefore such market risk is not considered to be material 
we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities
