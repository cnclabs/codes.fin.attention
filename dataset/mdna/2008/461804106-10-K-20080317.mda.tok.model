title insurance through its two wholly owned title underwriting subsidiaries  itic and ne itic  the company underwrites land title insurance for owners and mortgagees as a primary insurer 
itic and ne itic offer primary title insurance coverage to both owners and mortgagees of real estate and also offers the reinsurance of title insurance risks to other title insurance companies 
title insurance protects against loss or damage resulting from title defects that affect real property 
the commitment and policies issued are predominantly the standard american land title association alta approved forms 
title insurance policies 
there are two basic types of title insurance policies one for the mortgage lender and one for the real estate owner 
a lender often requires property owners to purchase title insurance to protect its position as a holder of a mortgage loan  but the lender s title insurance policy does not protect the property owner 
the property owner has to purchase a separate owner s title insurance policy to protect their investment 
the company issues title insurance policies on the basis of a title report 
the title report documents the current status of title to the property 
upon a closing  the seller executes a deed to the new owner 
when real property is conveyed from one party to another  occasionally there is an undisclosed defect in the title or a mistake in a prior deed  will or mortgage that may give a third party a legal claim against such property 
if a claim is made against real property  title insurance provides indemnification against insured defects 
the title insurer has the option to retain counsel and pay the legal expenses to eliminate or defend against any title defects  pay any third party claims arising from errors in title examination and recording or pay the insured s actual losses  up to policy limits  arising from title risks as defined in the policy 
a title risk is one of any number of things that could jeopardize the property owner s or mortgagee s interest in the property defined in the title policy 
such risks include title being vested in someone or some entity other than the insured  unmarketable title  lack of a right of access to the property  invalidity or unenforceability of the insured mortgage  or other defects  liens  or encumbrances against the property 
examples of common types of covered risks include defects arising from prior unsatisfied mortgages  tax liens or confirmed assessments  judgments against the property or encumbrances against the property arising through easements  restrictions or other existing covenants 
title insurance also generally protects against deeds or mortgages that contain inaccurate legal descriptions  that were forged or improperly acknowledged or delivered  that were executed by spouses without the other spouse s signature or release of marital interest or that were conveyed by minors or incompetents 
insured risk on policies in force 
generally  the amount of the insured risk or face amount of insurance on a title insurance policy is equal to the lesser of the purchase price of the insured property or the fair market value of the property 
in the event that a claim is made against the property  the insurer is responsible for paying the legal costs associated with eliminating covered title defects or defending the insured party against covered title defects affecting the property 
the insurer may choose to pay the policy limits to the insured or  if the loss is less than policy limits  the amount of the insured s actual loss due to the title defect  at which time the insurer s duty to defend the claim and all other obligations of the insurer with respect to the claim are satisfied 
at any given time  the insurer s actual risk of monetary loss under outstanding policies is only a portion of the aggregate insured risk  or total face amount  of all policies in force 
the lower risk results primarily from the reissuance of title insurance policies by other underwriters over time when the property is conveyed or refinanced 
the coverage on a lender s title insurance policy is reduced and eventually terminated as the mortgage loan it secures is paid 
an owner s policy is effective as long as the insured has an ownership interest in the property or has liability under warranties of title 
due to the variability of these factors  the aggregate contingent liability of a title underwriter on outstanding policies of the company and its subsidiaries cannot be determined with any precision 
losses and reserves 
while most other forms of insurance provide for the assumption of risk of loss arising out of unforeseen events  title insurance is based upon a process of loss avoidance 
title insurance generally serves to protect the policyholder from the risk of loss from events that predate the issuance of the policy 
losses on policies typically occur when a title defect is not discovered during the examination and settlement process or the occurrence of certain hidden risks which cannot be determined from an accurate search of public land records 
the maximum amount of liability under a title insurance policy is generally the face amount of the policy plus the cost of defending the insured s title against an adverse claim 
reserves for claim losses are established based upon known claims  as well as estimated losses incurred but not yet reported to the company  based upon historical experience and other factors 
title claims can often be complex  vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and may involve uncertainties as to ultimate exposure  and therefore  reserve estimates are subject to variability

geographic operations 
itic was incorporated in the state of north carolina on january   and became licensed to write title insurance in the state of north carolina on february  at present  itic primarily writes land title insurance in states and the district of columbia  primarily in the eastern half of the united states 
itic is licensed to write title insurance in states and the district of columbia 
ne itic was incorporated in the state of south carolina on february   and became licensed to write title insurance in that state on november  it currently writes title insurance as a primary insurer and as a reinsurer in the state of new york 
ne itic is also licensed to write title insurance in additional states and the district of columbia 
premiums from title insurance written in the state of north carolina represent the largest source of revenue for the title insurance segment 
in the state of north carolina  itic primarily issues title insurance commitments and policies through branch offices 
title policies are primarily issued through issuing agents in other states 
for a description of the level of net premiums written geographically by state  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report of shareholders incorporated by reference in this form k annual report 
each state license authorizing itic or ne itic to write title insurance must be renewed annually 
these licenses are necessary for the companies to operate as a title insurer in each state in which they write premiums 
ratings 
the company s title insurance subsidiaries are regularly assigned ratings by independent agencies designed to indicate their financial condition and or its claims paying ability 
the rating agencies determine ratings primarily by analyzing financial data 
itic has been rated by two independent fannie mae approved financial analysis firms  demotech  inc and lace financial corporation lace  with financial stability ratings of a a double prime  and b  respectively 
ne itic s financial stability also has been recognized by demotech  inc and lace with ratings of a a double prime  and a  respectively 
according to demotech  title underwriters earning a financial stability rating of a a double prime possess unsurpassed financial stability related to maintaining positive surplus as regards policyholders  regardless of the severity of a general economic downturn or deterioration in the title insurance cycle 
a lace rating of a or b indicates that a title insurance company has a strong overall financial condition that will allow it to meet its future claims  and that  generally  the company has good operating earnings  is well capitalized and has adequate reserves 
reinsurance 
the company assumes and cedes reinsurance with other insurance companies in the normal course of business 
reinsurance is a contractual arrangement whereby one insurer assumes some or all of the risk exposure written by another insurer 
ceded reinsurance is comprised of excess of loss treaties  which protects against losses over certain amounts 
in the ordinary course of business  itic and ne itic reinsure certain risks with other title insurers for the purpose of limiting their risk exposure and to comply with state insurance regulations 
they also assume reinsurance for certain risks of other title insurers for which they receive additional income 
for the last three years  revenues from reinsurance activities accounted for less than of total premium volume 
exchange services in  the company established investors title exchange corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary itec  to provide services in connection with tax deferred exchanges of like kind property pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
itec acts as an intermediary in tax deferred exchanges of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investments  and its income is derived from fees for handling exchange transactions and interest earned on client deposits held by the company 
investors title accommodation corporation itac provides services for accomplishing reverse exchanges when taxpayers decide to acquire replacement property before selling the relinquished property 
in february  the irs proposed new regulations which  if adopted  may negatively affect the ability of qualified intermediaries to retain a portion of the interest earned on exchange funds held during exchange transactions 
if passed as proposed  these regulations would adversely impact the exchange services segment and the company s net income  since a significant portion of the exchange segment s revenues are based on retaining a portion of the interest income earned on deposits held

title insurance itic and ne itic issue title insurance coverage through direct operations or through partially owned or independent title insurance agents who issue title policies on behalf of itic or ne itic 
title insurance premiums written reflect a one time premium payment  with no recurring premiums 
generally  premiums are recorded and recognized as revenue at the time of closing of the related transaction as the earnings process is considered complete 
where the policy is issued directly through a branch office  the premiums collected are retained by the company 
where the policy is issued through a title insurance agent  the agent retains a majority of the premium as a commission 
title insurance commissions earned by the company s agents are recognized as expense concurrently with premium recognition 
the percentage of the premium retained by agents varies by region to region and is sometimes regulated by the states 
for a description of the level of net premiums written by direct and agency operations  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in this form k annual report 
exchange services itec and itac provide customer services in connection with tax deferred exchanges pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
acting as a qualified intermediary  itec holds the proceeds from sales of relinquished properties until the acquisition of identified replacement properties occurs 
itac facilitates reverse tax deferred exchanges pursuant to irs revenue procedure cyclicality and seasonality title insurance real estate activity is cyclical in nature 
title insurance premiums are closely related to the level of real estate activity and the volume of mortgage origination 
a number of general and economic factors influence demand for title insurance  including changes in mortgage interest rates  consumer confidence  economic conditions  supply and demand and family income levels 
the title insurance business tends to be seasonal as well as cyclical 
historically  the winter months have the least real estate activity because fewer real estate transactions occur  while the remaining quarters are more active 
refinance activity is generally less seasonal  but it is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
exchange services seasonal and other factors affecting the level of real estate activity and the volume of title premiums written will also generally affect the demand for exchange services 
marketing title insurance the company markets its title insurance services to a broad range of customers in the residential and commercial market sectors of the real estate industry 
issuing agents are typically real estate attorneys or subsidiaries of community and regional mortgage lending institutions  depending on local customs and regulations and the company s marketing strategy in a particular territory 
itic and ne itic strive to provide superior service to their customers and consider this an important factor in attracting and retaining customers 
branch and corporate personnel strive to develop new business and agency relationships to increase market share and itic s commercial services division provides services to commercial clients 
exchange services marketing of tax deferred exchange services offered by itec and itac has been incorporated into the marketing of the core title products offered by itic and ne itic 
the commercial services division of itic also markets the services offered by itec and itac to its commercial clients 
regulation title insurance the company is an insurance holding company and therefore it is subject to regulation in the states in which its insurance subsidiaries do business 
these regulations  among other things  require insurance holding companies to register and file certain reports and require prior regulatory approval of the payment of dividends and other intercompany distributions or transfers 
title insurance companies are extensively regulated under applicable state laws 
all states have requirements for admission to do business as an insurance company  including minimum levels of capital and surplus and establishing reserves 
state regulatory authorities monitor the stability and service of insurance companies and possess broad powers with respect to the licensing of title insurers and agents  approving rate schedules and policy forms  financial reporting and accounting practices  reserve requirements  investments and dividend restrictions  as well as examinations and audits of title insurers 
both itic and ne itic meet the statutory premium reserve requirements and the minimum capital and surplus requirements of the states in which they are licensed 
a substantial portion of the assets of the company s title insurance subsidiaries consists of their portfolios of investment securities 
both of these subsidiaries are required by various states laws to maintain assets of a defined quality and amount 
the company s two insurance subsidiaries are subject to examination at any time by the insurance regulators in the states where they are licensed 
these and other governmental authorities have the power to enforce state and federal laws to which the title insurance subsidiaries are subject  including but not limited to  the real estate settlement procedures act 
itic is domiciled in north carolina and is subject to north carolina insurance regulations and other states where it does business 
the north carolina department of insurance typically schedules financial examinations every five years 
itic was last examined by the north carolina department of insurance for the period january  through december  no material deficiencies were noted in the report 
ne itic is domiciled in south carolina and subject to south carolina insurance regulations 
the south carolina department of insurance periodically schedules financial examinations 
ne itic was examined by the south carolina department of insurance for the period january  through december  no material deficiencies were noted

itic s last market conduct examination commenced in may for the period january  through december   with no material deficiencies noted 
ne itic s last market conduct examination commenced in november for the period january  through december   with no material deficiencies noted by the market conduct examiners 
the united states department of housing and urban development hud continues to indicate that it would like to make modifications to the real estate settlement procedures act respa and associated regulations 
hud published proposed rules regarding respa for public comment on march  with a day comment period that expires on may  according to hud  the proposed rules are intended to improve disclosure of the loan terms and closing costs consumers pay when purchasing or refinancing their home 
hud has also indicated that it intends to seek legislative changes to respa that will complement the rules and provide hud with enforcement mechanisms for some of the most important consumer disclosures and protections 
in april  the government accountability office gao released a report on the title insurance industry in which it recommended that hud and state insurance regulators take actions to improve consumers ability to comparison shop for title insurance and strengthen the regulation and oversight of the title insurance market  among other measures 
based on the information known to management at this time  it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of the gao recommendations for the title insurance industry s market and other matters  or the market s response to them 
however  any material change in the company s regulatory environment may have an adverse effect on its business 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing insurance holding companies and the title insurance industry are often introduced in congress  in the state legislatures and before the various insurance regulatory agencies 
the company regularly monitors such proposals and legislation  although the likelihood and timing of them and the impact they may have on the company and its subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time 
exchange services intermediary services are not federally regulated by any regulatory commissions  and neither itec or itac operate in any states that regulate this industry 
itec and itac both provide services to taxpayers pursuant to internal revenue service irs regulations that provide taxpayers a safe harbor by using a qualified intermediary to structure tax deferred exchanges of property and using an exchange accommodation titleholder to hold property in reverse exchange transactions 
periodically  changes to the tax code are proposed containing provisions that impact like kind exchanges 
in  the irs proposed new regulations which  if adopted  may negatively affect the ability of qualified intermediaries to retain a portion of the interest earned on exchange funds held during exchange transactions 
if passed as proposed  these regulations would materially adversely impact the exchange services segment and the company s net income

investment management and trust services investors trust company is regulated by the north carolina commissioner of banks 
investors trust company was last examined by the north carolina commissioner of banks for the period ended december  no material deficiencies were noted in the report of examination 
competition title insurance the title insurance industry is highly competitive 
itic s and ne itic s major competitors together comprise a majority of the title insurance market on a national level 
the number and size of competing companies varies in the different geographic areas in which the company conducts business 
key factors that affect competition in the title insurance industry are timeliness and quality of service  price  expertise and the financial strength and size of the insurer 
title insurance underwriters also compete for agents based upon service and commission levels 
some title insurers currently have greater financial resources  larger distribution networks and more extensive computerized databases of property records and related information than the company 
in addition  there are numerous industry related regulations and statutes that set out conditions and requirements to conduct business 
changes to or the removal of such regulations and statutes could result in additional competition from alternative title insurance products or new entrants into the industry that could materially affect the company s business operations and financial condition 
exchange services competition for itec and itac comes from other title insurance companies and agents  banks  attorneys  and other independently owned qualified intermediaries that offer exchange services 
key elements that affect competition are price  expertise  timeliness and quality of service and the financial strength and size of the company 
exchange services are not a regulated industry  there is no market data available regarding the company s market position in this industry 
customers the company is not dependent upon any single customer or a few customers  and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
investment policies the company and its subsidiaries derive a substantial portion of their income from investments in bonds municipal and corporate and equity securities 
the investment policy is designed to maintain a high quality portfolio and maximize income 
the company invests primarily in short term investments  federal and municipal governmental securities and investment grade debt securities and equity securities 
some state laws impose restrictions upon the types and amounts of investments that can be made by the company s insurance subsidiaries 
the company manages its investment portfolio and does not utilize third party investment managers 
the securities in the company s portfolio are subject to economic conditions and normal market risks

environmental matters the title insurance policies itic and ne itic currently issue exclude any liability for environmental risks and contamination 
although policies issued prior to may not specifically exclude such environmental risks  they generally do not provide affirmative coverage for such risks 
as a result  the company has not experienced and does not anticipate that it or its subsidiaries will incur any significant expenses related to environmental claims 
in connection with effecting tax deferred exchanges of like kind property  itec and itac may temporarily hold title to property pursuant to an accommodation titleholder agreement 
in such situations  the person or entity for which title is being held must execute an indemnification agreement pursuant to which it agrees to indemnify itec or itac  as appropriate  for any environmental or other claims which may arise as a result of the arrangement 
employees the company has no paid employees 
officers of the company are full time paid employees of itic

item a 
risk factors the risk factors listed in this section and other factors noted herein or incorporated by reference could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
the company s results of operations and financial condition are susceptible to the changing level of demand for title insurance 
the demand for the company s title insurance and other real estate transaction products and services varies over time and from year to year and is dependent upon  among other things  the volume of commercial and residential real estate transactions and mortgage refinancing transactions 
the volume of these transactions has historically been influenced by factors such as the state of the overall economy and mortgage interest rates 
when mortgage interest rates are increasing or during an economic downturn or recession  real estate activity typically declines and the title insurance industry tends to experience lower revenues and profitability 
both the volume and the average price of residential real estate transactions have recently experienced declines in many parts of the country  and these trends appear likely to continue 
volume is a key factor in the company s profitability due to the existence of fixed costs such as personnel and occupancy expenses associated with the support of the issuance of the insurance policy and of general corporate operations 
the overall demand for title insurance also depends in part upon the requirement by mortgage lenders and participants in the secondary mortgage market that title insurance policies be obtained on residential and commercial real property 
the company may experience losses resulting from fraud  defalcation or misconduct 
fraud  defalcation  regulatory noncompliance and other misconduct by the company s agents  approved attorneys and employees are risks inherent in the company s business 
agents and approved attorneys typically handle large sums of money in trust pursuant to the closing of real estate transactions and misappropriation of funds by any of these parties could result in large title claims 
differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserving assumptions may adversely affect the company s financial results 
the company s net income is affected by the extent to which its actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions used in establishing reserves for claims 
reserves for claims are established based on actuarial estimates of how much the company will need to pay for reported as well as incurred  but not yet reported claims 
in addition  management considers factors such as the company s historical claims experience  case reserve estimates on reported claims  large claims and other relevant factors in determining loss provision rates and the aggregate recorded expected liability for claims 
due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of reserves for claims  the company cannot determine precisely the amounts which it will ultimately pay to settle its claims 
such amounts may vary from the estimated amounts  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
to the extent that actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying assumptions used in establishing such liabilities  the company could be required to increase reserves 
title claims can often be complex  vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and may involve uncertainties as to ultimate exposure  and therefore  reserve estimates are subject to variability 
in addition  the company may experience unexpected large losses periodically which require it to increase its title loss reserves 
regulatory scrutiny of the industry and potential changes to respa could result in financial losses or otherwise impact the manner the company conducts business 
the title insurance industry has recently been under regulatory scrutiny in a number of states with respect to pricing practices  possible real estate settlement procedures act respa violations and unlawful rebating practices 
the regulatory investigations have resulted in settlements and fines for some title insurance underwriters 
in  the government accountability office released a report in response to a request from the house of representatives committee on financial services regarding the title industry 
the united states department of housing and urban development hud is responsible for enforcing respa 
hud continues to indicate that it would like to make modifications to respa and associated regulations which would result in changes to the existing industry regulatory framework that could have a material impact on the company s marketing and operations 
the company is periodically involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
the company s non insurance subsidiaries are also subject to state and federal regulations 
some of the company s other businesses operate within state and federal guidelines 
any changes in the applicable regulatory environment or changes in existing regulations could restrict its existing or future operations 
revenues from the company s exchange services segment are closely related to the tax rate on capital gains and other provisions in the internal revenue code 
the company s revenues in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors which are beyond its control 
in february  the irs proposed new regulations which  if adopted  may negatively affect the ability of qualified intermediaries to retain interest earned on exchange funds they are holding 
if passed as proposed  these regulations would materially adversely impact the exchange services segment and the company s net income  since a significant portion of the exchange segment s revenues are based on retaining a portion of the interest income earned on deposits held by the company 
in march  the irs issued a revised regulatory flexibility analysis and requested more specific information to help in determining the impact the rules would have on small businesses 
the proposed regulations have still not been finalized 
in addition  the investment management and trust services division is regulated by the north carolina commissioner of banks 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to complex government regulations 
the company s title insurance businesses are subject to extensive state laws and regulations by state insurance authorities in each state in which they operate 
these laws and regulations are primarily intended for the protection of policyholders and consumers 
the nature and extent of these laws and regulations typically involve  among other matters  licensing and renewal requirements and trade and marketing practices  including  but not limited to licensing of insurers and agents  approval of premium rates for insurance  limitations on types and amounts of investments  restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured by a single company  deposits of securities for the benefit of policy holders  filing of annual and other reports with respect to financial condition  approval of policy forms  and regulation regarding the use of personal information 
these laws and regulations are subject to change and may restrict the company s ability to implement rate increases or other actions that it may want to take to enhance its operating results or have a negative impact on its ability to generate revenue and earnings 
competition in the company s business affects its revenues 
the title insurance industry is highly competitive 
key factors that affect competition in the title insurance business are quality of service  price within regulatory parameters  expertise  timeliness and the financial strength and size of the insurer 
title companies compete for premiums by choosing various distribution channels which may include company owned operations and issuing agency relationships with attorneys  lenders  realtors  builders and other settlement service providers 
title insurance underwriters compete for agents on the basis of service and commission levels 
some title insurers currently have greater financial resources  larger distribution networks and more extensive computerized databases of property records and information than the company 
the number and size of competing companies varies in the different geographic areas in which the company operates 
competition among the providers of title insurance  new entrants to the industry or the acceptance of new alternatives to traditional title products by the marketplace could adversely affect the company s operations and financial condition 
the company s success relies on its ability to attract and retain key personnel and agents 
competition for skilled and experienced personnel and agents in the company s industry is high 
the company may have difficulty hiring the necessary marketing and management personnel to support any future growth 
the loss of any key employee or the failure of any key employee to perform in their current position could prevent the company from realizing future growth 
also  the company cannot provide assurance that it will succeed in attracting or retaining new agents 
its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if it is unsuccessful in attracting and retaining agents 
a downgrade or a potential downgrade in one of the company s financial strength ratings could result in a loss of business 
the competitive positions of insurance companies rely in part on the independent ratings of their financial strength and claims paying ability 
the company s financial strength is subject to continued periodic review by rating agencies 
a significant downgrade in the ratings of either of the company s policy issuing subsidiaries could negatively impact its ability to compete for new business and retain existing business and maintain licenses necessary to operate as title insurance companies in various states 
a decline in the performance of the company s investments could materially adversely affect net income and cash flows 
changes in general economic conditions  interest rates  activities in securities markets and other external factors could adversely affect the value of the company s investment portfolio and  in turn  the company s operating results and financial condition 
insurance regulations limit the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to it 
the company is an insurance holding company and has no substantial operations of its own 
the company s ability to pay dividends and meet its obligations is dependent  among other things  on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay funds to it 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to insurance and other regulations that limit the amount of dividends  loans or advances to it based on the amount of adjusted unassigned surplus and net income and require these subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts of capital  surplus and reserves 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require prior state insurance regulatory approval 
these dividend restrictions could limit the company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders or grow its business 
as of december   approximately  of the consolidated stockholders equity represented net assets of the company s subsidiaries that cannot be transferred in the form of dividends  loans or advances to the parent company under statutory regulations without prior insurance department approval 
for further discussion of the regulation of dividend payments and other transactions between affiliates  see liquidity and capital resources under management s discussion and analysis in item of this report 
the company may encounter difficulties managing growth or rapid technology changes  which could adversely affect its results 
the company has historically achieved revenue growth in part through a combination of developing related new products or services and increasing its market share for existing products 
a portion of the company s growth may be in services or geographic areas with which management is less familiar than with its core business and geographic areas 
the expansion of the company s business  particularly in new services or geographic areas  or significant changes in technology may subject it to associated risks  such as the diversion of management s attention  lack of substantial experience in operating such businesses and a change in competitive position resulting from rapid technology changes 
the company relies upon north carolina for about of its title insurance premiums 
north carolina is the largest source of revenue for the title insurance segment and  in  north carolina based premiums accounted for approximately of premiums earned by the company 
a decrease in north carolina business would negatively impact financial results 
key accounting and information systems are concentrated in a few locations 
the company s corporate headquarters  accounting and technology operations are concentrated in north carolina 
these critical business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters  fire  power shortages and other events beyond the company s control 
a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of the company s critical business operations or systems could severely affect its ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  there could be a material and adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
certain provisions of the company s shareholder rights plan may make a takeover of the company difficult 
the company has a shareholders rights plan which could discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to the company s shareholders for their common shares 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none item properties the company owns two adjacent office buildings and property located on the corner of north columbia and west rosemary streets in chapel hill  north carolina  which serve as the company s corporate headquarters 
the main building contains approximately  square feet and has on site parking facilities 
the company s principal subsidiary  itic  leases office space in locations throughout north carolina  south carolina  michigan and nebraska 
ne itic leases office space in one location in new york 
each of the office facilities occupied by the company and its subsidiaries are in good condition and adequate for present operations 
in november  the company purchased approximately  square feet of additional office space in chapel hill  north carolina that was previously leased for itec  itac  itic s commercial services division and itic s settlement services division 
item legal proceedings the company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings that are incidental to their business 
in the company s opinion  based on the present status of these proceedings  any potential liability of the company or its subsidiaries with respect to these legal proceedings will not  in the aggregate  be material to the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations
