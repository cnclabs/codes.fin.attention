overview cabot microelectronics corporation cabot microelectronics  the company  us  we  or our is the leading supplier of high performance polishing slurries used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuit ic devices within the semiconductor industry  in a process called chemical mechanical planarization cmp 
cmp is a polishing process used by ic device manufacturers to planarize or flatten many of the multiple layers of material that are deposited upon silicon wafers in the production of advanced ics 
demand for our cmp products is primarily driven by the number of wafers produced by semiconductor manufacturers  referred to as wafer starts 
we operate predominantly in one industry segment the development  manufacture and sale of cmp consumables 
we develop  produce and sell cmp slurries for polishing many of the conducting and insulating materials used in ic devices  and also for polishing the disk substrates and magnetic heads used in hard disk drives 
we also develop  manufacture and sell cmp polishing pads  which are used in conjunction with slurries in the cmp process 
we remain focused on the consistent and successful execution of our three strategic initiatives within our core cmp business maintaining our technological leadership  achieving operations excellence and connecting with our customers 
in fiscal  we significantly increased sales of our polishing pad product  which we believe is differentiated from other pad offerings 
we completed the installation of our new millimeter polishing tool and the related metrology equipment at our asia pacific technology center in geino  japan 
we also entered into a long term agreement with international business machine corporation to jointly develop cmp solutions for a variety of new applications and new materials 

table of contents the continued weakening of the us and global economy and the recent volatility in the capital and credit markets appear to have begun to affect end user demand for ic devices 
this reduction in end user demand  in turn  has caused our semiconductor customers to reduce their production 
recent analyst reports have forecasted that semiconductor foundries are expected to reduce their utilization rates by and a number of memory manufacturers have announced that they will reduce production as well 
since the primary driver of revenue for our cmp consumable products is wafer starts  this economic slowdown has affected us  and we believe will continue to adversely affect us in the near term 
however  we believe that growth opportunities in polishing pads  esf and slurry products for advanced dielectric and barrier applications may be able to partially offset a reduction in demand due to the economic downturn 
there are many other factors that make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends for our cmp business  including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  potential future acquisitions  short order to delivery time for our products and the associated lack of visibility to future customer orders  and quarter to quarter changes in our revenue regardless of industry strength 
in addition to strengthening and growing our core cmp business  through our engineered surface finishes esf business we seek to leverage our expertise in cmp formulation  materials and polishing techniques for the semiconductor industry to address other demanding market applications requiring nanoscale control of surface shape and finish  and gain access to a variety of markets that we do not currently serve 
we are pursuing a number of surface modification applications where we believe our technical ability to shape  enable and enhance the performance of surfaces at an atomic level can add value to our customers 
revenue for fiscal was million  which was an increase of from the million reported for fiscal this increase reflected solid demand for our cmp slurry products for the semiconductor industry during the first nine months of our fiscal year 
however  we began to feel the effects of a reduction in semiconductor wafer starts  which we believe was due to the overall worldwide economic slowdown  during our fourth quarter of fiscal as we experienced a decline in the demand for our cmp slurry products 
the overall revenue increase in fiscal from the prior year also reflected significant growth in sales of our polishing pad product as we generated million in pad revenue in fiscal compared to only million in fiscal the increase in revenue from these cmp consumable products was partially offset by lower revenue from our esf products and our cmp slurries for data storage applications 
gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was  which represents a decrease from the reported for fiscal the decrease was primarily driven by higher fixed production costs and lower manufacturing yields  both primarily associated with our developing pad business  and higher manufacturing variances  partially offset by a favorable product mix and higher utilization of our manufacturing capacity on a higher volume of sales 
we believe the low manufacturing yields in our pad business are common during a new product production ramp 
we made improvements to our pad manufacturing process through our six sigma efforts that enabled us to improve our pad margins in the second half of the fiscal year 
we expect to maintain our gross profit as a percentage of revenue in the range of to for the full fiscal year we may experience quarterly gross profit above or below this annual guidance range due to a number of factors including fluctuations in our product mix and the extent to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity 
operating expenses of million  which include research  development  technical  selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses  increased  or million  from the million reported for fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher professional fees  including fees related to the enforcement of our intellectual property  and higher staffing related costs 
in fiscal  we expect our full year operating expenses to be in the range of million to million 
diluted earnings per share of in fiscal increased  or  from reported in fiscal as a result of the factors discussed above 
diluted earnings per share in fiscal reflects the absence of a million pre tax million net of tax write off of our minority equity investment in nanoproducts corporation npc that reduced fiscal diluted earnings per share by approximately 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to bad debt expense  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  valuation and classification of auction rate securities  impairment of long lived assets and investments  business combinations  goodwill  other intangible assets  share based compensation  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as for identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical collection experience  adjusted for any specific known conditions or circumstances 
while historical experience may provide a reasonable estimate of uncollectible accounts  actual results may differ from what was recorded 
as of september   our allowance for doubtful accounts represented of gross accounts receivable 
if we had increased our estimate of bad debts to of gross accounts receivable  our general and administrative expenses would have increased by million 
warranty reserve we maintain a warranty reserve that reflects management s best estimate of the cost to replace product that does not meet customers specifications and performance requirements  and costs related to such replacement 
the warranty reserve is based upon a historical product replacement rate  adjusted for any specific known conditions or circumstances 
should actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
as of september   our warranty reserve represented of the current quarter revenue 
if we had increased our warranty reserve estimate to of the current quarter revenue  our cost of goods sold would have increased by million 
inventory valuation we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and write down the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or if inventory is deemed unmarketable 
an inventory reserve is maintained based upon a historical percentage of actual inventories written off applied against the inventory value at the end of the period  adjusted for known conditions and circumstances 
we exercise judgment in estimating the amount of inventory that is obsolete 
should actual product marketability and fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from those projected by management  revisions to the estimated inventory reserve may be required 
if we had increased our general reserve for obsolete inventory at september  by  our cost of goods sold would have increased by million 
valuation and classification of auction rate securities as of september   we owned two auction rate securities ars with an estimated fair value of million million par value of which million was classified as short term investments and million was classified as other long term assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
in general  ars investments are securities with long term nominal maturities for which interest rates are reset through a dutch auction every seven to days 
historically  these periodic auctions provided a liquid market for these securities 
general uncertainties in the global credit markets during caused widespread ars auction failures as the number of securities submitted for sale exceeded the number of securities buyers were willing to purchase 
as a result  the short term liquidity of the ars market has been adversely affected 

table of contents as discussed in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we have recorded a temporary impairment of million  net of tax  in the value of one of our ars in other comprehensive income and we have classified million of ars in other long term assets 
the calculation of fair value and the balance sheet classification for our ars requires critical judgments and estimates by management including an appropriate discount rate and the probability that a security may be monetized through a future successful auction or refinancing of the underlying debt 
we performed a discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate based on a market index comprised of tax exempt variable rate demand obligations  and we applied a risk factor to reflect current liquidity issues in the ars market 
we then assigned probabilities of holding each security for less than or equal to one year  five years  and to maturity to calculate a fair value for each security 
we also considered that we successfully monetized at par value all but two of the ars we owned as of february  the time we experienced our first failed auction  as some of the subsequent auctions were successfully completed and some of the issuing municipalities refinanced their debt 
if auctions involving our remaining ars continue to fail  if issuers of our ars are unable to refinance the underlying securities  if underlying municipalities are unable to pay their debt obligations and the bond insurance fails  or if credit ratings decline or other adverse developments occur in the credit markets  then we may not be able to monetize our remaining securities in the short term and we may also be required to further adjust the carrying value of these instruments through an impairment charge that may be deemed other than temporary 
impairment of long lived assets and investments sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in this grouping 
sfas requires that when the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the identified asset group is less than the carrying value of the asset group  an impairment provision may be required 
the amount of the impairment to be recognized is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset group from the net book value of the asset group 
determining future cash flows and estimating fair values require significant judgment and are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generally over a long term period 
we evaluate the estimated fair value of investments annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if an other than temporary impairment in the value of the investment has taken place 
business combinations in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired entities to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and in process research and development ipr d based on their estimated fair values 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows related to acquired developed technologies and patents and assumptions about the period of time the technologies will continue to be used in the company s product portfolio  expected costs to develop the ipr d into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the products when completed  and discount rates 
management s estimates of value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may cause actual realized values to be different from management s estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we determined that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired as of september  
table of contents share based compensation effective october   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires all share based payments  including stock option grants  restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards and discounts provided to employees on employee stock purchases  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
under sfas r  we calculate share based compensation expense using the straight line approach based on awards expected to ultimately vest  which requires the use of an estimated forfeiture rate 
our estimated forfeiture rate is primarily based on historical experience  but may be revised in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate 
we use the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model to estimate grant date fair value  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected term  the price volatility of the underlying stock and risk free interest rate 
a small change in the underlying assumptions can have a relatively large effect on the estimated valuation 
under sfas r  we estimate expected volatility based on a combination of our stock s historical volatility and the implied volatilities from actively traded options on our stock 
we use the simplified method to calculate the expected term as discussed in topic of the staff accounting bulletin series  share based payment  due to our limited amount of historical option exercise data  and we add a slight premium to the expected term for employees who would meet the definition of retirement pursuant to terms of their grant agreements during the contractual term 
the simplified method uses an average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option to calculate the expected term 
the risk free rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
prior to december   awards and grants made as part of our annual equity incentive award programs consisted solely of non qualified stock option grants 
in fiscal  the compensation committee of our board of directors decided to begin to award a blend of non qualified stock options and shares of restricted stock to employees and non employee directors as part of our annual equity incentive program 
this decision was made to address the financial impact of expensing equity based compensation under the rules of sfas r  as well as to provide a more competitive balance of equity incentives for employees and non employee directors 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that our future taxable income will be sufficient to realize our deferred tax assets 
significant changes to the estimates and judgments that support the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
on october   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
among other things  fin provides a more likely than not threshold for the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions  provides guidance on the accounting for interest and penalties relating to tax positions and requires the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial position 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances surrounding a tax position 
we evaluate these tax positions on a quarterly basis 
commitments and contingencies we have entered into certain unconditional purchase obligations  which include noncancelable purchase commitments and take or pay arrangements with suppliers 
we review our agreements on a quarterly basis and make an assessment of the likelihood of a shortfall in purchases and determine if it is necessary to record a liability 
in addition  we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business such as a legal proceeding or claim 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

table of contents effects of recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue of certain line items included in our historical statements of income year ended september  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit research  development and technical selling and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development operating income other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended september   versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal of this increase  million was due to increased sales volume including increased contribution from our polishing pad business  million was due to a higher weighted average selling price for our cmp consumable products  resulting from a higher priced product mix  and million was due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes 
our polishing pad business represented million of the revenue growth in fiscal as we won new business by gaining additional customer adoptions of our pads 
the continued weakening of the us and global economy and the recent volatility in the capital and credit markets appears to have negatively impacted end user demand for ic devices  which  in turn  has led to a reduction in the number of wafer starts in the semiconductor industry 
we believe the reduction in wafer starts will negatively impact the demand and revenue associated with our traditional cmp slurry products in fiscal however  we believe that growth opportunities in polishing pads  esf and slurry products for advanced dielectric and barrier applications may be able to partially offset a reduction in demand due to the economic downturn 

table of contents cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal of this increase  million was due to increased sales volume  million was due to increased fixed manufacturing costs  primarily in our pad business  million was due to lower manufacturing yields  particularly in our pad business  million was due to the effects of foreign exchange rate changes  million was due to certain other manufacturing variances and million was due to increased freight  packaging and other costs 
these increases were partially offset by a million benefit of higher utilization of our manufacturing capacity on the increased sales volume and by a million benefit of a lower cost product mix 
fumed metal oxides  such as fumed silica and fumed alumina  are significant raw materials that we use in many of our cmp slurries 
in an effort to mitigate our risk to rising raw material costs and to increase supply assurance and quality performance requirements  we have entered into multi year supply agreements with a number of suppliers 
for more financial information about our supply contracts  see tabular disclosure of contractual obligations included in item of part ii of this form k 
our need for additional quantities or different kinds of key raw materials in the future has required  and will continue to require  that we enter into new supply arrangements with third parties 
future arrangements may result in costs which are different from those in the existing agreements 
in addition  rising energy costs and general inflation may also impact the cost of raw materials  packaging  freight and labor costs 
we also expect to continue to invest in our operations excellence initiative to improve product quality  reduce variability and improve product yields in our manufacturing process 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to higher fixed production costs and lower manufacturing yields  both primarily associated with our pad business  and higher manufacturing variances partially offset by a favorable product mix and higher utilization of our manufacturing capacity on the increased volume of sales in fiscal the manufacturing yields in our pad business improved over the course of fiscal  but we expect the yields in this business may continue to fluctuate as we optimize our manufacturing process 
we expect to maintain our gross profit as a percentage of revenue in the range of to for full fiscal year quarterly gross profit may be above or below this range due to fluctuations in our product mix or other factors 
research  development and technical total research  development and technical expenses were million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal the decrease was primarily due to million in lower clean room materials and laboratory supplies and million in lower professional fees partially offset by million in higher staffing related costs and million in increased depreciation expense 
our research  development and technical efforts are focused on the following main areas research related to fundamental cmp technology  development and formulation of new and enhanced cmp consumable products  process development to support rapid and effective commercialization of new products  technical support of cmp products in our customers manufacturing facilities  and evaluation of new polishing applications outside of the semiconductor industry 

table of contents selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was primarily due to million in higher staffing related costs  including employee separation costs  million in increased professional fees  million in higher travel related costs and million in higher depreciation expense 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase resulted primarily from million in higher professional fees  including costs to enforce our intellectual property  and million in higher staffing related costs 
see part i  item entitled legal proceedings and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the enforcement of our intellectual property 
other income  net other income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the absence of a million pre tax impairment of our equity investment in npc and the absence of million of other expense related to our investment in npc 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in interest income as we monetized the majority of our short term investments in ars during fiscal and reinvested these funds into money market investments which earn interest at lower rates 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our short term investments 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to increased research and experimentation tax credits and reduced tax expense related to share based compensation  partially offset by lower tax exempt interest income 
we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal to be approximately percent 
net income net income was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal as a result of the factors discussed above 
year ended september   versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal of this increase  million was contributed by our qed technologies  inc qed subsidiary  as fiscal was the first full year we owned qed  and million was due to a higher average selling price for our slurry products 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease due to reduced sales volume in our core cmp business 
the higher average selling price for our slurry products resulted primarily from a higher priced product mix 

table of contents cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal of this increase  million was related to qed and million was due to an increase in the average cost per unit of our slurry products 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease due to reduced sales volume in our core cmp business 
the higher average unit cost resulted primarily from lower utilization of our manufacturing capacity due to the lower level of sales  primarily during the first half of the fiscal year  and higher fixed costs  partially offset by improvements in productivity and quality as well as benefits of a lower cost product mix 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal and improved basis points from the level achieved in fiscal the increase in gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue resulted primarily from a higher valued product mix and improvements in productivity and quality 
this was partially offset by lower utilization of our manufacturing capacity due to the lower level of sales of our core cmp products  primarily in the first half of the fiscal year  as well as higher fixed costs 
research  development and technical total research  development and technical expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased staffing related costs of million  largely resulting from the inclusion of qed for a full year in fiscal  increased depreciation and amortization costs of million  principally related to our data storage laboratory in singapore and our asia pacific technology center in japan  and increased professional fees of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in spending on wafers and laboratory supplies of million 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase resulted primarily from higher staffing costs of million  largely resulting from the inclusion of qed as well as expanding our presence in asia 
there were also smaller increases in costs for travel  professional fees and depreciation and amortization 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase resulted primarily from million in higher staffing costs  including million in share based compensation expense  and a million increase in professional fees  including costs to enforce our intellectual property 
purchased in process research and development we incurred no ipr d expenses in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  since we did not make any acquisitions in fiscal 
table of contents other income  net other income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a million impairment of our equity investment in npc  following a decision to not renew a collaboration agreement 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in interest income on our cash and short term investments  mostly due to higher interest rates  a decrease in interest expense of million related to capital leases  and the absence of million of expenses related to our investment in npc that we recognized in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to higher tax exempt interest income and increased research and experimentation tax credits 
net income net income was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash flows from operating activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal our cash provided by operating activities in fiscal originated from million in net income and million in non cash items  partially offset by a million decrease in cash flow due to a net increase in working capital 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal increased million from fiscal primarily due to increased net income in fiscal  higher non cash expenses related to depreciation and share based compensation and improved collections of accounts receivable  partially offset by a general increase in our inventory levels and the absence of a million non cash write off of our investment in npc that occurred in fiscal fiscal cash flows provided by investing activities were million 
net sales of short term investments were million as we monetized the majority of our ars during fiscal as discussed below 
this cash inflow was partially offset by million in cash used for purchases of property  plant and equipment primarily for the purchase and installation of a millimeter polishing tool and related metrology equipment for our asia pacific technology center and building improvements and equipment to increase our pad production capabilities 
in fiscal  cash used in investing activities was million 
we used million for net purchases of short term investments 
purchases of property  plant and equipment  including the expansion of our pad manufacturing capabilities in the us and taiwan as well as purchases for qed  were million 
we also used million to acquire a license of patents and we paid million for the earnout payment to the prior owners of qed  related to its revenue performance during the months following our acquisition 
see note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on business combinations and intangible assets 
in fiscal  cash flows used in investing activities were million  which included million for purchases of property  plant and equipment  primarily for the construction of our asia pacific technology center and for projects in our manufacturing operations 
we also completed two acquisitions during fiscal for a total of million  net of cash acquired 
in addition  we used million to acquire patents and associated rights relating to cmp slurry technology 
finally  million was provided by net sales of short term investments 
we estimate that our total capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million 
in fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities were million 
we used million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase programs and we made million in principal payments under capital lease obligations 
these cash outflows were partially offset by million received from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options under our second amended and restated cabot microelectronics corporation equity incentive plan  as amended and restated september   and shares issued under our cabot microelectronics employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities were million 
this resulted from million in purchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and million in principal payments under capital lease obligations  partially offset by million in net proceeds from the issuance of stock  primarily from the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities were million  primarily as a result of million in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and million in principal payments under capital lease obligations 
these outflows were partially offset by million from the issuance of common stock  primarily associated with our cabot microelectronics corporation employee stock purchase plan 

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed a share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in october for up to million 
in january  the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock 
shares are repurchased from time to time  depending on market conditions  in open market transactions  at management s discretion 
we fund share repurchases from our existing cash balance 
we view the program as a flexible and effective means to return cash to stockholders 
the program became effective on the authorization date and may be suspended or terminated at any time  at the company s discretion 
there was million remaining on this authorization as of september  we have an unsecured revolving credit facility of million with an option to increase the facility to million 
under this agreement  which was set to terminate in november  interest accrues on any outstanding balance at either the lending institution s base rate or the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin 
we also pay a non use fee 
in october  we amended this agreement to extend the termination date until november  with an option to renew for two additional one year terms 
the amendment did not include any other material changes to the terms of the credit agreement 
loans under this facility are intended primarily for general corporate purposes  including financing working capital and capital expenditures 
the credit agreement also contains various covenants 
no amounts are currently outstanding under this credit facility and we believe we are currently in compliance with the covenants 
at september   we owned two ars with an estimated fair value of million million par value of which million was classified as short term investments and million was classified as other long term assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
our ars investments consisted of tax exempt municipal debt obligations which have experienced failed auctions since february despite the failed auctions  there have been no defaults on the underlying securities and interest income on these holdings continues to be received on scheduled interest payment dates 
as discussed in notes and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded a million pretax and net of tax reduction in stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income to reflect a temporary decline in fair value 
we successfully monetized at par value the majority of ars we owned in fiscal and reinvested these funds in money market accounts 
based on our million cash balance as of september   our positive cash flow and our available debt capacity  we do not have any immediate needs for additional liquidity and we currently do not plan to enter any secondary ars market to monetize our remaining ars 
we believe it is likely that one of our ars will be monetized within the next operating cycle which for us is generally one year as the municipal bond issuer will be motivated to refinance its debt when credit markets improve due to higher interest rates being paid as auctions fail 
the recent capital and credit market crisis has adversely affected the us and global economy 
despite this crisis  we believe that cash generated by our operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  expected capital expenditures  including any merger and acquisition activities  and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 
however  we plan to expand our business and continue to improve our technology  and to do so may require us to raise additional funds in the future through equity or debt financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
the uncertainty in the capital and credit markets may hinder the ability to generate additional financing in the type or amount necessary to pursue such objectives 
off balance sheet arrangements at september  and  we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at september   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
contractual obligations less than after in millions total year years years years capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations capital lease obligations in december  we entered into a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation under which we agreed to pay cabot corporation for the expansion of a fumed alumina manufacturing facility in tuscola  illinois 
the payments for the facility have been treated as a capital lease for accounting purposes and the present value of the minimum quarterly payments resulted in an initial million lease obligation and related leased asset

the agreement will automatically renew unless either party gives certain notice of non renewal 
we are generally obligated to purchase fumed silica for at least of our six month volume forecast for certain of our slurry products  to purchase certain non material minimum quantities every six months  and to pay for the shortfall if we purchase less than these amounts 
we currently anticipate meeting all minimum forecasted purchase volume requirements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management we conduct business operations outside of the united states through our foreign operations 
some of our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the japanese yen and  to a lesser extent  the british pound and the euro 
from time to time we enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure 
however  we may be unable to hedge these exposures completely 
approximately of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
market risk and sensitivity analysis related to foreign exchange rate risk we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates 
as of september   the analysis demonstrated that such market movements would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows over a one year period 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency rate movements and our actual exposures 
market risk related to investments in auction rate securities at september   we owned two auction rate securities ars with a total estimated fair value of million million par value of which million was classified as short term investments and million was classified as other long term assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
in general  ars investments are securities with long term nominal maturities for which interest rates are reset through a dutch auction every seven to days 
historically  these periodic auctions have provided a liquid market for these securities 
general uncertainties in the global credit markets caused widespread ars auction failures as the number of securities submitted for sale exceeded the number of securities buyers were willing to purchase 
as a result  the short term liquidity of the ars market has been adversely affected 
in fiscal  we recorded a million pre tax and net of tax reduction in stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income to reflect a decline in fair value of our ars which we believed was temporary 
we believe that we will be able to monetize the remaining two securities at par  either through successful auctions  refinancing of the underlying debt by the issuers  or holding the securities to maturity 
however  if auctions involving our ars continue to fail  if issuers of our ars are unable to refinance the underlying securities  if the issuing municipalities are unable to pay debt obligations and the bond insurance fails  or if credit ratings decline or other adverse developments occur in the credit markets  then we may not be able to monetize these securities in the short term and we may also be required to further adjust the carrying value of these instruments through an impairment charge that may be deemed other than temporary
