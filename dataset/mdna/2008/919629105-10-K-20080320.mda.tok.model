item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company as of and for the years ended december  and the discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
those accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and uncertainties include the allowance for loan losses and impaired loans 
further information about these critical policies is described below 
allowance for loan losses certain credit risks are inherent in making loans 
we seek to prudently assess these risks and manage them effectively 
we have internal credit policies and procedures in place to reduce repayment risks 
these policies and procedures include officer and customer loan limits periodic loan documentation review and internal audit  and follow up on exceptions to credit policies 
we establish the allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings through a provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents an amount that  in our judgment  will be appropriate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
some of the factors we consider in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses are as follows an evaluation of the current loan portfolio identified loan problems loan volume outstanding past loss experience present and expected industry and economic conditions and  in particular  how such conditions relate to our market area 
problem loan trends over a year historical time period loan growth trends over a year historical time period on a quarterly basis  we perform a detailed analysis of the allowance for loan losses to verify the adequacy and appropriateness of the allowance in meeting possible losses in the loan portfolio 
in analyzing our current portfolio to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  we first segregate our portfolio into loans within the scope of fas potentially impaired loans and fas non impaired loan pools 
included in our potentially impaired loan category are our current watch list credits plus any additional credits which have been past due three or more times within the past month period 
we individually review these potentially impaired loans under fas and make a determination if the loan in fact is impaired 
we consider a loan impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
we do not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect the ultimate collection of all amounts due 
if it is found to be impaired  an allowance is established when the collateral value  discounted cash flows  or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
we recognize any impairment by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses or by adjusting an existing valuation allowance for the impaired loan with a corresponding charge or credit to bad debt expense 
the valuation allowance becomes our specific reserve for the specific loan 

table of contents we take the balance of our portfolio and add back to it any loans that were included in the potentially impaired loan category but that were found not to be impaired 
we then segregate the remaining portfolio into specific categories based on type of loan and review the groups of loans to estimate loss under fas accounting rules for loss contingencies 
we apply a specific loss factor to each category based upon our historical loss experience for each category of loans over the previous five years 
the loss factor is multiplied by the outstanding balance in the loan category to estimate potential loss for our allowance for loan losses 
we then evaluate certain environmental and qualitative factors that are relevant to our portfolio and make a risk assessment of low  medium  or high for each factor 
an additional loss factor is assigned to the portfolio according to the risk assessment 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  because it requires estimates that may be significantly revised as more information becomes available 
bank regulators also periodically review the loan portfolio and other assets to assess their quality  and we employ independent  third party loan reviewers as well 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be significantly revised as more information becomes available 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to provide for expected losses in the loan portfolio  but there are no assurances that it will be 
overview the company was incorporated as a virginia stock corporation on march   primarily to own and control all of the capital stock of the bank 
the bank opened for business on may  there are currently eight full service branch locations  operating in various locations throughout the cities of roanoke and salem  town of vinton  and the county of roanoke 
the company also operates a wealth management subsidiary  valley wealth management services  inc which markets investment and insurance products 
net income derived from the new subsidiary is not significant at this time 
the company s investment in the bank was million as of december   and million as of december  performance summary the following table shows our key performance ratios for the years ended december  and key performance ratios months ended months ended return on average assets return on average equity net interest margin cost of funds yield on earning assets basic net earnings per share diluted net earnings per share all percentage calculations are on an annualized basis

table of contents our performance for was impacted by the unusually high level of nonperforming assets held throughout the year 
however  due to the successful resolution of all three of our large problem loan relationships subsequent to year end  we were able to reduce the specific reserves previously set aside for these credits by over  during the fourth quarter of additionally  we took active and prudent steps by charging off in excess of million in problem loan assets during we believe these events  combined with the million equity capital raised in the private placement offering in the fall of last year  will enable us to move forward from a position of strength despite the uncertain and unsettling economic environment 
additionally  as can be seen from the table above  our cost of funds has increased by basis points year over year in comparison to an increase of only basis points in our yield on earning assets  resulting in a further squeeze on our net interest margin 
the increase in our cost of funds is due to the intense competition for deposits in combination with the relatively flat yield curve over the past months 
however  the resolution of our three large problem loan assets will reduce our non performing assets by nearly  from of total assets to just of total assets  as we head into this should impact our net interest margin and the overall earnings picture in a very positive manner 
while we are cautiously optimistic about  we continue to be concerned about the continued weakness in the residential real estate market and general slowdown in economic activity 
we did not participate in the subprime  alt a or third party originated mortgage programs that are now resulting in heavy loan losses at many banks throughout the country  but the net effect of these activities may weaken the economy  in general

total liabilities at december  were million  up from million at december   an increase of million or 
deposits decreased million or to million from the million level at december  we allowed a piece of our higher cost of deposits to mature during the year due to a softening in loan demand 
total liabilities at december  were million  up from million at december   an increase of million or  with the increase primarily represented by a million growth in deposits  a million increase in short term borrowings  an million in crease in long term borrowings  a million increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase  a million increase in other liabilities  offset by a million decrease in federal funds purchased 

table of contents we intend to continue to execute our business model by focusing on our core business and stressing personal service to satisfy customers  although we constantly evaluate the effectiveness of the model 
due to our intense focus on restoring asset quality  we intentionally slowed down our asset growth during as we head into  we are focused on returning to double digit asset growth rates 
however  competition for deposits remains heightened and our ability to fund loan growth will be dependent upon our ability to grow our deposit base at a reasonable cost 
during  we were successful in reducing our overall reliance on certificates of deposits by raising approximately million of new deposits in a new money market product  which is tied to the wsj prime rate 
this deposit account continued to attract enthusiasm from customers as our deposit balances grew to over million in this account by the end of we will be introducing a new deposit checking account during the first quarter of that we believe will strengthen our ability to further reduce our reliance on higher rate certificates of deposits going forward and will be a great complement to the prime money market product offering

net income we earned net income of million for the year ended december   equivalent to the million reported for the same period in net income for the three months ended december  was million  an increase of million over the million reported for the fourth quarter of we earned net income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of over the million reported for the same period in net income for the three months ended december  was million  a decrease of over the million reported for the fourth quarter of net interest income net interest income is our principal source of earnings and is calculated as the amount by which loan and investment earning assets income exceeds the interest expense on deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income 
changes in the interest rate environment and the company s cost of funds also affect net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  a million decrease when compared to the million reported for december  net interest income for the quarter ended december  was million  equivalent to the same period last year

loan interest income includes loan fees of million  million and million for the years ended   and  respectively 
nontaxable interest income is adjusted to its fully taxable equivalent basis using a federal tax rate of percent 
the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income tax equivalent basis by average total earning assets 
non accrual loans are included in the above yield calculation 

table of contents as discussed above  the company s net interest income is affected by the change in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities referred to as volume change as well as by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds referred to as rate change 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of changes in interest income and interest expense for the major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the amounts of change attributable to variations in volumes and rates 
changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and rate  respectively

this risk can take one or more of several forms repricing risk comes from timing mismatches in the ability to alter contractual rates earned on financial assets held or paid on interest bearing liabilities basis risk refers to changes in the underlying relationships between market rates or indices  which result in a narrowing of the spread earned on a loan or investment relative to its cost of funds 
option risk arises from embedded options in many financial instruments such as interest rate options  loan prepayment options  deposit early withdrawal options  callable federal home loan bank advances  and pre payment of the underlying collateral of asset backed securities 
embedded options are complex risk positions that are difficult to predict and offset  and are a large component of our overall interest rate risk 
we have established risk measures  limits  policy guidelines and internal control mechanisms for managing our overall asset liability management position 
the responsibility for interest rate risk control resides with management  with oversight by the board of directors and the asset liability oversight committee 
we seek to balance the return potential of the asset liability management position against the desire to limit volatility in earnings 

table of contents at least quarterly  we measure the asset liability management position using earnings simulation modeling to estimate what assets and liabilities would re price  and to what extent  within a one year period in response to an immediate and basis point change in the prime rate  as well as in response to more gradual interest rate changes 
our objective is to keep the change in net interest income over twelve months at or below  and to keep the change in net income at or below  under an immediate basis point interest rate shock scenario 
the model also incorporates management s forecasts for balance sheet growth  noninterest income and noninterest expense 
the interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management s view of future market movements 
rather  these are intended to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may apply to our earnings 
modeling the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate risk is highly dependent on numerous assumptions embedded in the simulation model 
while the earnings sensitivity analysis incorporates management s best estimate of interest rate and balance sheet dynamics under various market rate movements  the actual behavior and resulting earnings impact likely will differ from that projected 
we also estimate interest sensitivity by calculating the net present value of the balance sheet s cash flows or the residual value of future cash flows ultimately due to shareholders 
this calculation is known as economic value of equity or eve and is generally considered a better measure of long term interest sensitivity than the interest rate shock scenarios 
our objective is for the result to change or less in an immediate basis point interest rate shock scenario 
the following table shows the sensitivity of the company s balance sheet at the date indicated  but is not necessarily indicative of the position on other dates

table of contents derivative financial instruments for asset liability management purposes  we may use interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate risk exposure to declining rates 
such derivatives are used as part of the asset liability management process and are linked to specific assets  and have a high correlation between the contract and the underlying item being hedged  both at inception and throughout the hedge period 
interest rate swaps are contracts in which a series of cash flows from interest are exchanged over a prescribed period  based upon a notional amount 
the notional amount on which the interest payments are based is not exchanged 
the company entered into its first such derivative instrument in april when it entered into a forward start interest rate swap agreement agreement to convert a portion of its variable rate loans to a fixed rate cash flow hedge 
we entered into this agreement to protect the bank from interest rate exposure during a period of declining rates 
the effective period of the agreement was april  through april  as of december   the mark to market adjustment  net of taxes  included in other comprehensive income for this agreement was  during the first quarter of  we terminated this interest rate swap agreement due to the shift of the bank s balance sheet to a more liability sensitive position and the changing interest rate environment as compared to when the bank entered into the agreement 
the bank recorded a realized gain on the termination of the agreement of  noninterest income noninterest income is made up of several categories as shown in the following table s omitted months ended months ended increase decrease service charges on deposits income earned on life insurance contracts other income realized securities gains losses total noninterest income service charges on deposit accounts consist of a variety of charges imposed on demand deposits  interest bearing deposits and savings deposit accounts 
these include  but are not limited to  the following demand deposit monthly activity fees service charges for checks for which there are non sufficient funds or overdraft charges atm transaction fees debit card transaction fees 
table of contents the principal factors that may affect current or future income for service charges on deposit accounts are internally generated growth acquisitions of other banks branches or de novo branches adjustments to service charge structures other income consists of several categories  primarily the following income earned on insurance policies owned by the bank on key executives fees for the issuance of official checks fees for wire transfers safe deposit box rent income from the sale of customer checks income on real estate loans extension fees  insurance premiums  and letter of credit fees levels of income derived from these categories vary 
for example  general market conditions and new insurance premiums purchased affect the income earned on bank owned life insurance 
fees for the issuance of official checks and customer check sales tend to grow as new branches are added 
fee schedules  while subject to change  generally do not alone yield a significant or discernable increase in income when they change 
additionally  with changing interest rates  mortgage originations and re financings have slowed down  which decreases the fee income earned on real estate loans 
noninterest expense s omitted months ended months ended increase decrease compensation occupancy equipment data processing advertising and marketing insurance audit fees legal fees franchise tax expense business manager deposit expense loan expense computer software foreclosed asset expenses  net n m other expense total noninterest expense 
table of contents as can be seen from the table above  noninterest expense increased by a total of million or from december  to december  a few items to note are as follows compensation expense has increased over the prior year due to merit and promotional increases during the year as well as the addition of new positions 
as in  we did not accrue for any executive officer performance bonuses 
additionally  our amortized expense for salary deferral is lower than the same period last year as a result of lower loan growth 
occupancy and equipment expense increases are primarily attributable to the new occupancy and related equipment purchases of the th and th floors of our main headquarters 
we took occupancy of the new floors at the end of the first quarter of the increase in our data processing expense is primarily related to our conversion to an imaged item processing environment during the nd half of our advertising marketing expenses year to date are less than the same period last year because we did not embark upon any major advertising campaigns during the relatively soft loan demand eliminated the need for extensive certificate of deposit advertising during the increase in insurance expense is due to the significant increase in fdic assessment as a result of the federal deposit insurance reform act of  which new assessments went into effect january  audit fees have increased due to additional regulatory costs associated with compliance 
we incurred a significant increase in legal expenses during as compared to due to the workout of problem credit relationships as well as personnel and corporate governance issues 
our business manager program expenses are down year over year due to a reduction in overall billings by our business manager customers 
deposit expense is down year over year due to the write off of  related to a fraudulent check scheme that occurred during the first quarter of as well as the overall decrease in our deposit balances year over year 
the decline in loan expense is due to lower loan growth than in the same period last year 
legal expenses associated with the work out of problem credits are included in the legal expense category above 
included in our other expense are current expenses associated with our network consultant which were charged to either equipment or computer software expense categories in prior years  depending on the nature of his work 
noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million over the same period ended december  for the year ended december   we experienced an increase in our advertising and marketing expenses which were primarily attributable to the television advertising costs associated with the new prime money market account 
compensation expense continued to increase as anticipated due to the growth of the bank 
the increase in is a result of new hires as well as merit and promotional increases to all employees during the year 
however  all year end performance bonuses for for executive officers were eliminated as a result of the company s performance for this elimination totaled approximately  our business manager expenses increased as compared to the prior year due to the growth of that program 
noninterest expenses are expected to continue to increase as a direct result of business growth  expansion and complexity of banking operations  and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  which imposes additional management and reporting burdens on reporting companies such as this one

the anticipated federal income tax liability equates to an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
factors contributing to the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory rate of percent include historical tax credits  tax exempt interest income on municipal securities  net of disallowance  and tax exempt income earned on bank owned life insurance

commercial loans generally are made to provide operating lines of credit  to finance the purchase of inventory or equipment  and for other business purposes 
the credit worthiness of the borrower is analyzed and re evaluated on a periodic basis 
most commercial loans are secured with business assets such as accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
even with substantial collateral  such as all the assets of the business and personal guarantees  commercial lending involves considerable risk of loss in the event of a business downturn or failure of the business 
commercial real estate loans 
commercial real estate construction and commercial real estate mortgages represent interim and permanent financing of commercial properties that are secured primarily by real estate 
the company prefers to make commercial real estate loans secured by owner occupied properties 
these borrowers are engaged in business activities other than real estate  and the primary source of repayment is not solely dependent on conditions in the real estate market 
real estate construction loans 
real estate construction loans represent interim financing on residential and commercial properties under construction  and are secured by real estate 
this category also includes acquisition and development financing for residential and commercial projects 
once construction is completed and the loan becomes permanent  the loans are reclassified as either commercial real estate loans  which are secured by commercial property  or residential real estate loans  which are secured by first deeds of trust 
residential real estate loans 
residential real estate loans are secured by deeds of trust on family residential properties 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the company usually limits the final maturity of residential real estate loans held for its own portfolio to years  although exceptions are made for competitive reasons and under special programs 
residential real estate lending involves risk elements when there is lack of timely payment and or a decline in the value of the collateral 
loans to individuals 
we offer various secured and unsecured consumer loans  including unsecured personal loans and lines of credit  automobile loans  deposit account loans  installment and demand loans  letters of credit  and home equity loans 

table of contents asset quality summary of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an amount that  in our judgment  will be adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  although there can be no assurance that this will be so 
the provision for loan losses increases the allowance  and loans charged off net of recoveries reduce the allowance 
a provision for loan losses of million was made during  a decrease of million or from the million provided during the decrease in the loan loss provision is a result of a decrease in loan growth as well as the resolution of our three large problem credits subsequent to year end 
this allowed us to reduce our overall loan loss provision by over  as we eliminated the unneeded specific reserves that were associated with these problem credits 
for the year ended december   our non performing assets to total assets ratio decreased from at december  to and will be reduced further to at the end of january as a result of the resolution of the three large problem loan assets 
additionally  our ratio of loans past due more than days to total loans decreased from at december  to at december  net charge offs for the year ended december  amounted to million in comparison to million for the year ended december  a provision for loan losses of million was made during  an increase of million or from the million provided during the increase in the loan loss provision was the result of an increase in non performing loans 
for the year ended december   our non performing assets to total assets ratio increased from at december  to 
additionally  our loans past due more than days to total loans increased from at december  to at december  the allowance for loan losses was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding was approximately at december   which compares to approximately of total loans at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are primarily based on our historical loss experience  portfolio concentrations  evaluation of individual loans and economic conditions 
a total of million in specific reserves was included in the balance of the allowance for loan losses as of december  for impaired loans  which compares to a total of million as of december  we regularly review asset quality and re evaluate the allowance for loan losses 
however  no assurance can be given that unforeseen adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased provisions in the future 
our current market environment  with a nationwide recession possible  makes this risk even higher 
additionally  regulatory examiners may require us to recognize additions or reductions to the allowance based upon their judgment about the loan portfolio and other information available to them at the time of their examinations

table of contents capital adequacy our financial position at december  and reflects liquidity and capital levels currently adequate to fund anticipated near term business expansion 
our capital ratios are above the required regulatory minimums for a well capitalized institution 
we review the adequacy of our capital on an ongoing basis 
we seek to maintain a capital structure adequate to support anticipated asset growth and serve as a cushion to absorb potential losses and will continue to monitor the bank capital ratios very closely due to the impact our non accrual loans have on retained earnings and capital 
for the periods indicated  we had the following risk based capital and leverage ratios capital ratios ratio tier total leverage liquidity asset liability management activities are designed to ensure that adequate liquidity is available to meet loan demand or deposit outflows and  through the management of our interest sensitivity position  to manage the impact of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income 
liquidity measures our ability to meet our maturing obligations and existing commitments  to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels  to fund our operations and to provide for customers credit needs 
liquidity represents a financial institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds from alternative funding sources 
the level of deposits may fluctuate  perhaps significantly so  due to seasonal cycles of depositing customers and the promotional activities of competitor financial institutions 
similarly  the level of demand for loans may vary significantly and at any given time may increase or decrease substantially 
however  unlike the level of deposits  management has more direct control over lending activities and if necessary can adjust the level of those activities according to the amounts of available funds 
liquid assets  which include cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits at other banks and non pledged securities available for sale  at december   totaled million

impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company and the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as do the prices of goods and services 
management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
recent and future accounting considerations in march  the fasb ratified the consensus reached on eitf  accounting for collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangements eitf 
the postretirement aspect of this eitf is substantially similar to eitf discussed above and requires that an employer recognize a liability for the postretirement benefit related to a collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangement in accordance with either fasb statement no 
or apb opinion no 
 as appropriate  if the employer has agreed to maintain a life insurance policy during the employee s retirement or provide the employee with a death benefit based on the substantive agreement with the employee 
in addition  a consensus was reached that an employer should recognize and measure an asset based on the nature and substance of the collateral assignment split dollar life insurance arrangement

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
before this statement  limited guidance existed for reporting noncontrolling interests minority interest 
as a result  diversity in practice exists 
in some cases minority interest is reported as a liability and in others it is reported in the mezzanine section between liabilities and equity 
specifically  sfas requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financials statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interests 
sfas is effective for the company on january  earlier adoption is prohibited 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  the adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements
