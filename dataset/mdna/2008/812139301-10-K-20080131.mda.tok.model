item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this filing 
except where the context suggests otherwise  the terms we  us and our refer to sealy corporation and its subsidiaries 
business overview we believe we are the largest bedding manufacturer in the world  with a domestic market share of approximately in we believe our market share in is comparable to we manufacture and market a complete line of bedding innerspring and non innerspring products  including mattresses and box springs  holding leading positions in key market categories such as luxury bedding products and among leading retailers 
according to home furnishing news in  the sealy brand ranked th among the top home products brands 
our conventional bedding products include the sealy  sealy posturepedic  stearns foster and bassett brands and accounted for approximately of our total net sales for the year ended december  in addition to our innerspring bedding  we also produce a variety of visco elastic memory foam and latex foam bedding products 
we expect to experience continued growth in these product lines as we seek to strengthen our competitive position in the specialty bedding non innerspring mattress market 
we distinguish ourselves from our major competitors by maintaining our own component parts manufacturing capability and producing substantially all of our mattress innerspring and latex mattress components requirements and approximately half of our box spring component parts requirements 
the growth of the bedding industry has been supported by economic and demographic factors such as increasing disposable income among the baby boomer sector of the population  an increase in the number of bedrooms per home and second home purchases  and growing awareness of the health benefits of quality sleep 
in  we successfully completed the rollout of our new single sided  no flip sealy and stearns foster unicased product lines in the united states  canada  and mexico  representing the broadest product redesign in our history 
the manufacture and sale of these products for our sealy posturepedic lines began in mid  followed by the introduction of the new stearns foster lines in the first fiscal quarter of our initial profitability from the sales of these new products was limited as we worked to gain manufacturing efficiency with the new designs and supported our customers transition to the new products with price rollbacks 
in  with these issues substantially behind us  we began to realize the anticipated contribution of these products to our sales growth and profitability  which has continued through our shares of the luxury and ultra luxury product categories are greater than our overall market share  and our stearns foster and luxury posturepedic lines directly target these categories 
late in the first fiscal quarter of  we introduced our new trueform visco elastic bedding product line  followed by the introduction of our springfree latex mattress in late  to take advantage of the rapid growth of the specialty bedding category 
this market  which includes latex foam  visco elastic and air adjustable mattress products  has experienced substantial growth both domestically and internationally 
we believe that by successfully leveraging our strong brand advantage and our marketing and distribution capabilities  we have the potential to make significant gains in the specialty bedding category 
our industry continues to be challenged by the volatility in the price of petroleum based and steel products  which affects the cost of our polyurethane foam  polyester  polyethylene foam and steel innerspring component parts 
due to tightness in supply  we have also seen an increase in price for rayon fibers 
during fiscal and  the cost of these components remained elevated above their recent historical averages  and we expect these costs to continue at or above current levels into we have continued to see sales growth in our international operations over the last several years  with our foreign subsidiaries contributing of our total revenues during fiscal however  our brazilian subsidiary  contributing less than of our revenues for fiscal  has continued to perform below our expectations and has not yet achieved profitability 
on january   management made the decision to cease manufacturing operations in brazil and move to a distribution business model that is supplied by production from other sealy manufacturing facilities 
as a result  the company will incur certain costs related to one time terminations of employees at this facility 
additionally  the assets of this facility are expected to be transferred and used in other facilities in south america 
while we do not believe that we have suffered any impairment with respect to our investment in long lived assets in brazil  we will continue to monitor that operation closely as we evaluate our strategic alternatives in that market 
foam material supply disruption  raw materials the market prices of foam material were significantly impacted by the hurricanes of and the rise in petroleum prices 
we believe that we will continue to experience upward pressure on pricing for these and other petroleum based products 
in addition  high loft fibers are a popular choice to replace polyurethane foam products in times of peak demand or shortage  thus we believe high loft fiber will also likely experience some upward pressure in we also experienced slight upward pressure on steel pricing due to a number of factors  including increased steel scrap pricing directly impacting the ability of domestic mills to maintain cost ratios 
worldwide production has not been able to keep up with the increased demand  due in part to decreased productive capacity in the united states 
furthermore  the weakening of the us dollar and the imposition of export tariffs levied by the chinese government has raised the relative price of steel imported into the united states 
consequently  we believe that the cost of cold rolled steel and steel drawn wire used in the production of the spring units and other components within our mattress and box springs will remain elevated above recent historical averages throughout critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
us gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
we choose accounting policies within us gaap that our management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
our management regularly assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions 
our accounting policies are stated in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item we believe the following accounting estimates are critical to understanding our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements cooperative advertising  rebate and other promotional programs we enter into agreements with our customers to provide funds to the customer for advertising and promotion of our products 
we also enter into volume and other rebate programs with our customers whereby funds may be rebated to the customer 
when sales are made to these customers  we record liabilities pursuant to these agreements 
we periodically assess these liabilities based on actual sales and claims to determine whether all of the cooperative advertising earned will be used by the customer or whether the customers will meet the requirements to receive rebate funds 
we generally negotiate these agreements on a customer by customer basis 
some of these agreements extend over several periods and are linked with supply agreements 
most of these agreements coincide with our fiscal year  however  our customers typically have ninety days following the end of a period to submit claims for reimbursement of advertising and promotional costs 
therefore  significant estimates are required at any point in time with regard to the ultimate reimbursement to be claimed by our customers 
subsequent revisions to such estimates are recorded and charged to earnings in the period in which they are identified 
costs of these programs totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
of these costs  amounts associated with volume rebates  supply agreement amortization  slotting fees  end consumer rebates and other customer allowances which were recorded as a reduction of sales were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the costs associated with cooperative advertising were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses and were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we actively monitor the financial condition of our customers to determine the potential for any nonpayment of trade receivables 
in determining our reserve for bad debts  we also consider other general economic factors 
our management believes that our process of specific review of customers combined with overall analytical review provides an accurate evaluation of ultimate collectibility of trade receivables 
we recorded a bad debt provision of million  or approximately percent of sales  in fiscal provisions for bad debts recorded in fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
warranties and product returns our warranty policy provides a year non pro rated warranty service period on all currently manufactured sealy posturepedic  stearns foster and bassett bedding products and some other sealy branded products and a year warranty period on the major components of our trueform and mirrorform visco elastic products as well as our springfree latex product  introduced in  the last ten years of which are pro rated on a straight line basis 
in  we introduced right touch  which has a twenty year limited warranty that covers only certain parts of the product and is pro rated for part of the twenty years 
in fiscal  we amended our warranty policy on sealy brand promotional bedding to three years for our new line introduced in january and shipped in the second quarter of fiscal the impact of the changes to the warranty policies did not have a significant impact on our financial results or position 
our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage at the time the sale is recorded based on historical trends of warranty costs 
our estimate involves an average lag time in days between the sale of a bed and the date of its return applied to the current rate of warranty returns 
we utilize warranty trends on existing similar product in order to estimate future warranty claims associated with newly introduced product 
our accrued warranty liability totaled million and million as of december  and november   respectively 
share based compensation plans we have four share based compensation plans  as described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item we adopted the provisions of fas no 
revised share based payment fas r effective august   the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal previously  we accounted for our stock option and stock incentive plans in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and made no charges except to the extent required by apb opinion no 
against earnings with respect to options granted 
for new awards issued and awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the date of adoption  the cost is equal to the fair value of the award at the date of the grant  and compensation expense is recognized for those awards earned over the service period 
certain of the equity awards vest based upon the company achieving certain ebitda performance targets 
during the service period  management estimates whether or not the ebitda performance targets will be met in order to determine the vesting period for those awards 
at the date of grant  we determine the fair value of the awards using the black scholes option pricing formula or the trinomial lattice model  as appropriate under the circumstances 
management estimates the period of time the employee will hold the option prior to exercise and the expected volatility of sealy corporation s stock  each of which impacts the fair value of the stock options 
self insurance liabilities we are self insured for certain losses related to general liability  product liability  automobile  workers compensation and medical claims 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and is reviewed by us and third party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
while management believes these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  medical cost inflation  or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates  our results of operations could be impacted 
during fiscal  we recognized a reduction of reserves totaling million due to favorable loss development from a reduction in both the frequency and severity of historical claims experience 
during fiscal  we recognized a reduction of reserves totaling million which included a million change in estimate due to a change from industry loss development factors to our own historical loss development factors 
the remaining change relates to favorable loss development due to a reduction in both the frequency and severity of historical claims experience 
all such charges relate to plant labor and are therefore included in cost of goods sold for the period 
impairment of goodwill we perform at least an annual assessment of our goodwill for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
we assess recoverability using several methodologies  which include the present value of estimated future cash flows and comparisons of multiples of enterprise values to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the analysis is based upon available information regarding expected future cash flows of each reporting unit and discount rates 
discount rates are based upon the cost of capital specific to the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted fair value of the reporting unit  a second analysis is performed to measure the fair value of all assets and liabilities 
if  based on the second analysis  it is determined that the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  we would recognize impairment for the excess of carrying value over fair value 
the total carrying value of our goodwill was million and million at december  and november   respectively 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings  claims  and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
a negative outcome of these matters is considered remote  and management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes we record an income tax valuation allowance when the realization of certain deferred tax assets  including net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards  is not more likely than not 
these deferred tax items represent expenses recognized for financial reporting purposes  which may result in tax deductions in the future 
certain judgments  assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of the valuation allowance and income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements 
our net deferred tax assets at december  were million  net of a million valuation allowance 
significant judgment is also required in evaluating our federal  state and foreign tax positions and in the determination of our tax provision 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we may establish and have established reserves when we believe that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and we may not fully prevail in overcoming these challenges 
we may adjust these reserves as relevant circumstances evolve  such as guidance from the relevant tax authority  our tax advisors  or resolution of issues in the courts 
in addition  the fasb recently issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item we are still assessing the potential impact of adopting this interpretation 
our tax expense includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
conditional asset retirement obligations in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fas and provides additional guidance on the timing and method for the recognition and measurement of such conditional obligations 
fin became effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted fin as of the beginning of fiscal and has recorded an adjustment as of november   the first day of fiscal  of approximately million  net of income tax benefit of million  to recognize the cumulative effect of the accounting change 
in addition  the company recorded million in property  plant and equipment and a liability of million in other noncurrent liabilities as of november  during fiscal  the company recognized an additional million in property  plant and equipment and other noncurrent liabilities for leases entered into during the year 
in fiscal  the company recognized an additional million in property  plant and equipment and other noncurrent liabilities for leases entered into during the year 
the company also recognized accretion expense of million during fiscal and an insignificant amount during fiscal these resulted from obligations in certain of the company s facility leases that require the company to return those properties to the same or similar condition at the end of the lease as existed when the company began using those facilities 
although the lease termination dates range from to  the company may be able to renegotiate such leases to extend the terms 
on a pro forma basis for the year ended november   the effects would have been immaterial 
in addition to the above obligations  the company also owns certain factories that contain asbestos 
current regulations require that the company remove and dispose of asbestos if the factory undergoes major renovations or is demolished 
although the company is not required to remove the asbestos unless renovation or demolition occurs  it is required to monitor and ensure that it remains stable and is required to notify any potential buyer of its existence 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an asset retirement obligation of million to remove asbestos at a us facility that was renovated in the second quarter of fiscal also  in fiscal  the company removed asbestos at an european facility 
the company has recognized an asset retirement obligation of million for the remaining asbestos in its european facilities 
the company has not recognized asset retirement obligations in its financial statements for asbestos at any other facilities because management believes that there is an indeterminate settlement date for the retirement obligation as the range of time over which the company may be required to remove and dispose of the asbestos is unknown or cannot be estimated 
the company currently has no plans to demolish a factory or to undertake a major renovation that would require removal of the asbestos at any of these other facilities 
management will continue to monitor this issue and will record an asset retirement obligation when sufficient information becomes available to estimate the obligation 
initial public offering on april   we completed an initial public offering ipo of our common stock  raising million of net proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount 
we used a portion of the proceeds to pay a cash dividend to shareholders of record immediately prior to the ipo of million 
we also used a portion of the proceeds from the ipo to repurchase and retire million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due june the notes in a series of open market transactions completed on april  at prices ranging from to of par  plus accrued interest 
on april   we used approximately million of ipo proceeds to redeem the entire outstanding balance of the senior subordinated pay in kind notes pik notes  along with accrued interest and prepayment penalties through the date of the redemption 
for a detailed presentation of the sources and uses of cash from the ipo  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included in item merger and recapitalization on april   we completed a merger with an entity owned by affiliates of kkr whereby kkr acquired approximately of our capital stock 
certain of our stockholders prior to the merger  including affiliates of bain capital  llc and others  which we refer to collectively as rollover stockholders retained approximately an interest in our capital stock 
additionally  we refinanced our existing debt agreements in connection with this merger 
subsequently on september   sealy mattress company a owned subsidiary of the company  completed an exchange offer whereby all of the senior subordinated notes were exchanged for publicly traded  registered securities with identical terms other than certain terms relating to registration rights and certain interest rate provisions otherwise applicable to the original senior subordinated notes

year ended december  compared with year ended november  net sales 
our consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were  million  an increase of million  or from the year ended november  fiscal year was a week year  while fiscal year was a week year 
the increase in net sales attributable to the rd week was million 
total americas net sales were  million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal this increase was primarily related to our us and canadian operations within the americas segment 
total us net sales were  million for fiscal compared to  million for fiscal in response to the challenging market conditions in the us bedding industry and increased competition in the luxury portion of the market  our focus has been on driving unit volume 
by driving unit volume  we were able to maintain the number of slots on the floors of our retail customers 
we believe that by maintaining these slots  we are in a better position to take advantage of any improvement in industry conditions  and more importantly  insure that we will have sufficient distribution points for new products 
this strategy drove a us net sales increase of million which was attributable to an increase in unit volume  partially offset by a decrease in average unit selling price 
the increase in unit volume is primarily attributable to the strong performance of our sealy brand promotional product sales  which were up from the prior year period  and growth of our specialty bedding product sales  which increased over the comparable prior year period 
the decrease in our average unit selling price is primarily due to the higher volume of lower priced mattresses  such as our sealy brand promotional products and lower sales of higher priced luxury innerspring products 
in  we intend to fill many of the slots we currently have at our retail partners with a new line of posturepedic products to compete more effectively at the higher price points 
in addition  strategic pricing actions were taken on selected products such as the stearns foster and trueform lines to drive unit volume 
in canada  local currency sales gains of translated into gains of in us dollars 
local currency sales gains in our canadian market were driven by a increase in unit volume  combined with a decrease in average unit selling price 
the changes in unit volume and average unit selling price were the result of selective pricing actions and promotional activity with national accounts 
elsewhere in the americas  we experienced sales gains in our mexico and argentina markets 
in our european segment  local currency sales gains of translated into an increase of in us dollars 
local currency sales gains in the european market were attributable to a increase in unit volume driven by increased sales of latex bed cores to other manufacturers  combined with a decrease in average unit selling price associated with the increased sales of lower priced latex bed cores 
finished goods sales in europe increased in local currency or in us dollars in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  an increase of million compared to fiscal the results include the impact of the rd week  which represented million 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased percentage points to

total americas gross profit increased million to million  which as a percentage of sales  represented a decrease of percentage points to 
us gross profit decreased million to million or of net sales  which is a decrease of percentage points of net sales from the prior year period 
this decrease in percentage of net sales was driven by the addition of million of flame retardant materials to our products  the change in product mix and strategic pricing actions mentioned above and million of start up costs associated with the new latex facility in mountain top  pa 
in addition  results included a million favorable adjustment due to changes in estimates underlying the reserves for workers compensation claims in and prior years 
partially offsetting these effects were continued improvements in our manufacturing efficiencies  lower employee health insurance costs arising from our transition to a new third party administrator  as well as million of refunds on lumber tariffs received from canadian suppliers see note of the consolidated financial statements in item 
on a per unit basis  us material costs increased over the prior year due primarily to additional costs to make our products compliant with the federal flame retardancy regulations  partially offset by improved yield on raw materials 
in canada  our gross profit margin decreased percentage points to of net sales primarily due to pricing actions taken that reduced average unit selling prices 
in our european segment  the gross profit margin decrease resulted from increased sales of lower priced latex bed cores to other manufacturers  which carry a lower unit price and gross margin 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december  and november  this increase as a percent of sales is primarily due to million of volume driven variable expenses  including a million increase in cooperative advertising costs and a million increase in delivery costs due primarily to higher unit volume 
other cost increases included a million increase in promotional expenses in the us operations associated with the roll out of our new posturepedic reserve products and stearns foster product line and other promotional expenses  a million increase in spending on national advertising and million of costs associated with an organizational realignment in the us this increase was partially offset by a million reduction in compensation and other sales and administration costs in addition to a gain on the sale of our orlando facility of million

during fiscal  we incurred million of expenses directly related to the initial public offering ipo  which included approximately million of transaction related bonuses paid to management employees and million paid to kkr for the termination of the management services agreement  and million in expenses related to debt retirement and noncash compensation 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in item royalty income  net of royalty expense 
our consolidated royalty income  net of royalty expense  for fiscal decreased million to million from fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in international royalty revenue 
interest expense 
our consolidated interest expense in fiscal decreased million from fiscal  primarily due to lower debt levels resulting from million in voluntary prepayments of our senior term debt since november   the retirement of million of pik notes and million of the notes in the second quarter of fiscal using proceeds from the ipo as well as the retirement of million of the notes in fiscal these reductions were partially offset by slightly higher borrowing costs

our consolidated net sales for the year ended november  were  million  an increase of million  or from the year ended november  total unit sales for the year ended november  were above the prior year 
total americas net sales were  million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal this increase was primarily related to our us and canadian operations within the americas segment 
total us net sales were  million for fiscal compared to  million for fiscal the us net sales increase of million was attributable to a increase in average unit selling price  partially offset by a decrease in unit volume 
the decrease in unit volume is primarily attributable to the impact of our customers transitioning to our new posturepedic and stearns foster models 
the products affected by these changes represented approximately of our total us sales 
additionally  we saw increased competitive pressures particularly in the to  retail price range 
the decrease is partially offset by the strong growth of our promotional innerspring and specialty lines  which we define as those products utilizing cores made of foam or other materials rather than innerspring 
the most significant change in the lines is that the new products were designed to comply with federal fire safety standards that went into effect july  for all mattress manufacturers 
the increase in average unit selling price is primarily due to price increases announced in november to offset the effects of rising raw material costs  partially offset by a greater portion of sales coming from lower priced promotional units 
in canada  local currency sales gains of translated into gains of in us dollars 
local currency sales gains in canada were driven by a increase in unit volume  combined with a increase in average unit selling price 
other sales gains in the americas were primarily due to unit volume gains in mexico and argentina

local currency sales gains in europe were attributable to a increase in unit volume driven by increased sales of latex bed cores to other manufacturers  combined with a decrease in average unit selling price associated with the increased sales of lower priced latex bed cores 
gross profit 
consolidated gross profit for fiscal was million  an increase of million compared to fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased percentage points to 
this was due primarily to an increase in our us and canada gross profit margins within our americas segment 
total americas gross profit increased million to million  which  as a percentage of sales  represented a increase of percentage points to 
us gross profit increased million to million or of net sales  which is an increase of percentage points of net sales from the prior year period 
this increase was attributable to a increase in average unit selling price  a million dollar reduction in workers compensation reserves associated with claims from prior years and improved manufacturing efficiences 
these improvements were partially offset by higher material costs and an increase in the sales mix of lower margin promotional bedding 
on a per unit basis  domestic material costs increased over the prior year due primarily to increased foam and packaging costs 
in canada  gross profit as a percentage of sales increased percentage points to due primarily to higher average unit selling prices 
elsewhere in the americas  gross margin increased in mexico  argentina and brazil due to higher average unit selling prices 
in our european segment  gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased percentage points to due to lower average unit selling prices resulting from increased sales of lower priced latex bed cores  which carry a lower unit price and gross margin 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses were and for the years ended november  and november  this increase as a percent of sales is primarily due to million of higher promotional expenses in the us associated with the roll out of our new posturepedic and stearns foster product lines  and higher volume driven variable expenses such as cooperative advertising costs and delivery costs in both the domestic and international operations partially offset by cost management efforts 
in addition  fiscal included a million gain on the disposal of two former facilities 
expenses associated with ipo 
we incurred million of expenses directly related to the ipo in the second quarter  which included approximately million of transaction related bonuses paid to management employees and million paid to kkr for the termination of the management services agreement  and million in expenses related to debt retirement and noncash compensation 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in item royalty income  net of royalty expense 
royalty income  net of royalty expense  for fiscal increased million to million from fiscal  primarily due to increased sales to licensees

our interest expense in fiscal decreased million over fiscal  primarily due to lower debt levels resulting from million in voluntary prepayments of our senior term debt since november   as well as the retirement of the pik notes and a portion of the senior subordinated notes in the second quarter of fiscal using proceeds from the ipo 
these reductions were partially offset by slightly higher borrowing costs 
our weighted average borrowing costs for fiscal and were and  respectively 
our borrowing cost remained flat due to higher interest rates on the unhedged variable rate of our floating rate debt being offset by lower interest rates on the fixed component of our senior secured term debt interest rate as a result of the april and august amendments of our senior secured credit agreement and the related extinguishment of our senior unsecured term loan 
debt extinguishment and refinancing expenses 
during fiscal we incurred million of debt extinguishment costs consisting of million of cash expenses and million of noncash charges related to the extinguishment of debt retired using proceeds from the ipo as well as million of cash expenses and million of noncash charges related to the refinancing of our senior term debt in august  during fiscal  we incurred million of debt extinguishment costs consisting of million of cash expenses and million of noncash charges related to the refinancing of our senior term debt in april  income tax 
our effective income tax rate generally differs from the federal statutory rate due to the effects of certain foreign tax rate differentials and state and local income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was and  respectively 
the effective rate for the fiscal period was reduced by a benefit of approximately million resulting from a reduction in our income tax reserve as a result of the elimination of certain federal and state tax exposures and approximately million from the reduction of the valuation allowance on capital loss carryforwards due to the availability of capital gains 
our effective rate for fiscal was significantly increased due to the provision of approximately million of income taxes on foreign earnings repatriated to the united states during fiscal liquidity and capital resources principal sources of funds our principal sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
our principal use of funds consists of operating expenditures  payments of principal and interest on our senior credit agreements  capital expenditures  interest payments on our outstanding senior subordinated notes  dividend payments to shareholders  stock repurchases and debt repurchases 
capital expenditures totaled million for the year ended december   including approximately million for additional facilities and production capacity in the united states 
we believe that annual capital expenditure limitations in our current debt agreements will not prevent us from meeting our ongoing capital needs 
our introductions of new products typically require us to make initial cash investments in inventory  promotional supplies and employee training which may not be immediately recovered through new product sales 
however  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to absorb such expenditures related to new products and that these expenses will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating cash flow 
at december   we had approximately million available under our revolving credit facility after taking into account letters of credit issued totaling million 
our net weighted average borrowing cost was and for the years ended december  and november   respectively 
as a result of the ipo completed april   approximately million of the net proceeds were used to retire the senior subordinated pik notes including accrued interest and prepayment penalties thereon  and approximately million was used to repurchase and retire million of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under our notes along with accrued interest and market premiums thereon 
we also retired million of our notes during the third quarter of fiscal and an additional million during the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  on august   we amended our senior secured credit agreement which reduced the applicable interest rate margins charged on the senior secured term loans  as discussed below 
since this date  we have repaid million of the outstanding balance of the term loans  including million of payments made in fiscal debt we have incurred debt  including senior credit facilities consisting of a million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in and senior secured term loan facilities maturing in august and august outstanding balances on these senior facilities were million at december  we also have an outstanding principal balance of million at december  on our notes 
on august   we amended our senior secured credit agreement to provide for two senior secured term loans  one for million maturing august  and one for million maturing august  this amendment reduced the applicable interest rate margins charged on the senior secured term loans  provided certain financial leverage ratio tests are met  by basis points on the million loan and basis points on the million loan 
in addition  this amendment provides us with greater flexibility for sealy mattress company to make dividend payments to us  or to repay certain subordinated debt  provided certain leverage ratio tests and other conditions are met 
the terms and conditions of our million senior revolving credit facility were unchanged by the amendment 
in connection with the amendment  we incurred a charge of million during the third fiscal quarter of  including a noncash charge of million for the write off of deferred finance charges and million of related fees and expenses 
since august  we have repaid million of the original million outstanding on our term loan maturing august  and million of the original million outstanding on our term loan maturing august  future principal debt payments are expected to be paid out of cash flows from operations and borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
as of january   we have million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the new senior secured credit facilities bear interest at our choice of the eurodollar rate or adjusted base rate abr  in each case  plus an applicable margin  subject to adjustment based on a pricing grid 
annually  we may be required to make principal prepayments equal to of excess cash flow for the preceding fiscal year  as defined in our senior secured credit agreement  if our leverage ratio is less than to reducing to if our leverage ratio is less than to 
we do not expect there to be any mandatory prepayments due in fiscal on june   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective july  fixing the floating portion of the interest rate at on million of the outstanding balance under the senior secured term loan through november  declining to million from december through november concurrent with the refinancing of our senior secured term loan  we de designated million of this swap as a hedging instrument and recorded a reduction of interest expense of million related to this de designation 
this swap expired in december on june   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective december  fixing the floating portion of the interest rate at on million of the outstanding balance under the senior secured term loan through november  declining to million from december through november  and further declining to million from december through november we will select the eurodollar rate on the hedged portion of the senior secured term loan during the term of the swap 
the outstanding notes consist of million aggregate principal amount maturing june   bearing interest at per annum payable semiannually in arrears on june and december  commencing on december  on september   we completed an exchange offer whereby all of the notes were exchanged for publicly traded  registered securities with identical terms other than certain terms relating to registration rights and certain interest rate provisions otherwise applicable to the original senior subordinated notes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased million principal amount of the notes 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we used a portion of the proceeds from the ipo to retire approximately million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we retired an additional million and million  respectively  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
we expect this redemption to reduce our annual interest cost by million  including a reduction of million in the amortization of debt issuance costs related to the notes 
on july   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated pay in kind pik notes to certain institutional investors in transactions exempt from registration under the securities act of the pik notes accrue interest in kind at per year  compounded semi annually  and mature on july  on april   we used approximately million of the proceeds from the ipo to redeem the outstanding principal amount of the pik notes and pay accrued interest thereon through the date of the redemption  along with a related redemption premium 
at december  we were in compliance with the covenants contained within our senior credit agreements and indenture governing the notes 
as part of our ongoing evaluation of our capital structure  we continually assess opportunities to reduce our debt  which opportunities may from time to time include voluntary prepayments of our senior secured term debt  or redemption or repurchase of a portion of our senior subordinated notes to the extent permitted by our debt covenants 
in addition  our board authorized a common stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million of our company s stock 
as of december   we had repurchased million under this program  million of which was repurchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal from december  through january   there were no repurchases of shares under this program 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  or to pay the interest or liquidated damages  if any  on or to refinance our indebtedness  or to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based upon the current level of operations  we believe that cash flow from operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under the senior credit agreement  will be adequate to meet the future liquidity needs during the one year following december  we will be required to make scheduled principal payments of approximately million during the next twelve months  with million for our senior secured term loans  million for our financing obligations and capital leases and the remainder for debt owed by our international subsidiaries 
however  as we continually evaluate our ability to make additional prepayments as permitted under our senior credit agreements  it is possible that we will make additional voluntary prepayments on our senior debt during that time 
while we believe that we will have the necessary liquidity through our operating cash flow and revolving credit facility for the next several years to fund our debt service requirements  capital expenditures and other operational cash requirements  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  realize anticipated revenue growth and operating improvements or obtain future borrowings under the senior credit agreements in an amount sufficient to enable us to do so 
in addition  the expiration of the revolving credit facility in  followed by the maturities of the senior and subordinated debt in the following years through  will likely require us to refinance such debt as it matures 
we may not be able to affect any future refinancing of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
dividend during fiscal  the company paid out dividends totaling million 
on january   our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of per share of common stock payable on february  to stockholders of record as of january  this will result in a dividend distribution of approximately million to be paid during the first quarter of fiscal cash flow analysis the following table summarizes our changes in cash fiscal year in thousands statement of cash flow data cash flows provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    effect of exchange rate changes on cash  change in cash and cash equivalents    cash and cash equivalents beginning of period    end of period    we use a week fiscal year ending on the closest sunday to november  but no later than december the fiscal years ended november  and november  were week years

year ended december  compared with year ended november  cash flows from operating activities 
our cash flow from operations increased million to a million net source of cash for the year ended december   compared to a million net source of cash for the year ended november  contributing to this increase was the inclusion of approximately million of expenses in net income and interest payments associated with the ipo and related debt extinguishments in the prior year  with the remaining increase primarily the result of changes in working capital and timing of various vendor payments 
cash flows from investing activities 
our cash flows used in investing activities increased approximately million from fiscal primarily due to million higher capital expenditures for fiscal as compared with the prior fiscal year 
the increased capital expenditures were primarily due to the completion of our new facility in orlando  fl  the completion of the mountain top  pa facility and the commencement of work on a second production line at the same facility and the construction of a warehouse at our production site in italy 
these expenditures were partially offset by million higher proceeds on sales of assets  including million received from the sale of our orlando  fl facility 
cash flows from financing activities 
our cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended december  increased million to a net use of million from a net use of million for the year ended november  this increase has been primarily driven by million used to repurchase our common stock  the retirement of million of our notes and million of payments on our senior secured term loans in fiscal these uses have been partially offset by an increase in the net borrowings against our outstanding senior revolving credit facility of million in fiscal in fiscal  we received million of ipo proceeds which were used to make a million dividend payment and to retire million of debt 
year ended november  compared with year ended november  cash flows from operating activities 
our cash flow from operations decreased million to a net source of cash for the year ended november   compared to a million net source of cash for the year ended november  contributing to this decline were approximately million of cash expenses and interest payments associated with the ipo and related debt extinguishments  with the remaining decline primarily the result of changes in working capital and timing of various vendor payments  partially offset by lower cash payments for interest during fiscal as compared to the fiscal due to a larger initial interest payment on the notes made in december  cash flows from investing activities 
our cash flows used in investing activities increased approximately million from fiscal primarily due to million of proceeds from the sale of three of our former manufacturing facilities received in fiscal as compared with only million of proceeds for sales of property  plant and equipment received in fiscal  and million higher capital expenditures for fiscal as compared with the prior fiscal year 
cash flows from financing activities 
our cash flow from financing activities for the year ended november  increased million to a net use of million from a net use of million for the year ended november  during the second quarter of  a portion of the million of ipo proceeds was used to make a million dividend payment and to retire million of debt 
additional dividend payments for a total of million were made in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of excluding debt retired with ipo proceeds  debt repayments  net of borrowings  were approximately million higher during the year ended november  due to million of voluntary prepayments on the senior term debt made in the prior fiscal year 
debt covenants our long term obligations contain various financial tests and covenants 
the senior secured credit facilities require us to meet a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
the indenture governing the notes also requires us to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio in order to incur additional indebtedness  subject to certain exceptions 
we are currently in compliance with all debt covenants 
the specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements  each of which we have previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 
certain covenants contained in the senior secured credit facilities and notes are based on what we refer to herein as adjusted ebitda 
in those agreements  ebitda is defined as net income plus interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance as discussed above 
adjusted ebitda is presented herein as it is a material component of these covenants 
for instance  the indenture governing the notes and the agreement governing sealy mattress company s senior secured credit facilities each contain financial covenant ratios  specifically leverage and interest coverage ratios  that are calculated by reference to adjusted ebitda 
non compliance with the financial ratio maintenance covenants contained in sealy mattress company s senior secured credit facilities could result in the requirement to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under such facilities  while non compliance with the debt incurrence ratios contained in the indenture governing the notes would prohibit sealy mattress company and its subsidiaries from being able to incur additional indebtedness other than pursuant to specified exceptions 
in addition  under the restricted payment covenants contained in the indenture governing the notes  the ability of sealy mattress company to pay dividends is restricted by formula based on the amount of adjusted ebitda 
while the determination of unusual items is subject to interpretation and requires judgment  we believe the adjustments listed below are in accordance with the covenants discussed above and are pursuant to the terms of the debt agreement or approval of the debtors 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under gaap and do not purport to be alternatives to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
additionally  they are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management s discretionary use  as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments  tax payments and debt service requirements 
because not all companies use identical calculations  these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies

significant judgment is required in evaluating our federal  state and foreign tax positions and in the determination of our tax provision 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we have established reserves where we believe that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and we may not fully prevail in overcoming these challenges 
while we are currently undergoing examinations of our corporate income tax returns by tax authorities  no issues related to these reserved positions have been presented to us 
we believe that such audits will not result in an assessment and payment of taxes related to these positions during the one year following december  we also cannot predict when or if any other future tax payments related to these tax positions may occur

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposures our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of our subsidiaries functional currency as compared to the currencies of our foreign denominated purchases 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
the result of a uniform change in the value of the us dollar relative to currencies of countries in which we manufacture or sell our products would not be material to our earnings or financial position 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
to protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from purchases in a foreign currency  we have instituted a forecasted cash flow hedging program 
we hedge portions of our purchases denominated in foreign currencies with forward contracts 
at december   we did not have any such contracts outstanding 
we do not designate our foreign currency hedges for accounting purposes  therefore all changes in fair value are included in net income 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt 
to manage this risk  we enter into interest rate swap agreements to convert certain variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
at december  and november   we had an interest rate swap agreement that fixed the floating portion of the interest rate at on million of our outstanding balance under the senior secured term loan 
the fair value of this swap instrument was an asset of million at november  this swap expired on december  and we had recognized a receivable of million at december  as of december   we had an outstanding interest rate swap agreement effective december  that fixes the floating portion of the interest rate at on million of the outstanding balance under the senior secured term loan through november  declining to million from december through november  and further declining to million from december through november the fair value of this swap instrument was a liability of million at december  we also entered into two interest rate swap agreements associated with debt that no longer exists 
although the related debt was repaid  the related swaps remained in effect until their expiration in december because the first swap converted a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate and a subsequent swap effectively re established a floating rate on the same debt  the effect of the two instruments on both cash flows and earnings was largely offsetting 
the combined fair value carrying amount of these swap instruments at november  was a net obligation of million 
a increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect our interest rate derivative instrument would not have a material impact on our earnings during the next fiscal year 
based on the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt outstanding at december   a basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates would have an approximately million dollar impact on our annual interest expense 
commodity price risks the cost of our steel innerspring  polyurethane foam  polyester and polyethylene component parts are impacted by volatility in the price of steel and petroleum 
due to a tightness in supply  we have also seen an increase in the price of rayon fibers 
we expect the cost of the components to remain elevated above their recent historical averages and in some instances increase above current price levels 
the gulf coast hurricanes of caused significant temporary shortages which had an adverse impact on the cost of foam materials used in the manufacture of our products 
the impact from the hurricanes continues through to this day 
we do not engage in commodity hedging programs
