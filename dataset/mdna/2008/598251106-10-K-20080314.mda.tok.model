item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s principal business is conducted by the bank which provides of a full range of community based financial services  including commercial and retail banking 
the profitability of the company s operations depends primarily on its net interest income  provision for loan losses  noninterest income  noninterest expenses  and income taxes 
net interest income is the difference between the income the company receives on its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the provision for loan losses reflects the cost of credit risk in the company s loan portfolio 
noninterest income consists of service charges on deposit accounts  securities gains or losses  net trading profits or losses  gains on sales of loans  insurance and brokerage commissions  trust income  increase in cash surrender value of life insurance  and other noninterest income 
noninterest expenses include salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  professional services  and other noninterest expenses 
the company is subject to state and federal income taxes 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts of and yields on interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market interest rates and is dependent on the company s asset liability management procedures to react appropriately to such changes 
the provision for loan losses is based upon management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions 
noninterest expenses are influenced by the growth of operations  with additional employees necessary to staff and marketing expenses necessary to promote the bank branches 
growth in the number of account relationships directly affects such expenses as data processing costs  supplies  postage  and other miscellaneous expenses 
the provision for income taxes is affected by tax law and regulation  accounting principles and policies  and income tax strategies 
see note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more details 
the following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the periods indicated 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the selected consolidated financial data presented herein 
in addition to historical information  the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
discussed below are those critical accounting policies that are of particular significance to the company 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
the company s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses represents an estimation performed pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors 
table of contents for impairment of a loan 
the allowance reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category 
the specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of commercial  commercial real estate and agricultural loans over  where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification 
these analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations and changes in portfolio mix and volume and other qualitative factors 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examinations  may require the company to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
the process for determining the allowance which management believes adequately considers all of the potential factors which potentially result in credit losses includes subjective elements and  therefore  may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect the company s earnings or financial position in future periods 
a loan is impaired when full payment of all principal and interest under the original loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage and consumer loans and on an individual basis for other loans 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
income taxes the company recognizes expense for federal and state income taxes currently payable as well as for deferred federal and state taxes for estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets  as well as loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in either the carryforward or carryback periods to cover net operating losses generated by the reversal of temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is provided by way of a charge to income tax expense if it is determined that it is not more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
if different assumptions and conditions were to prevail  the valuation allowance may not be adequate to absorb unrealized deferred taxes and the amount of income taxes payable may need to be adjusted by way of a charge or credit to expense 
furthermore  income tax returns are subject to audit by the irs and state taxing authorities 
income tax expense for current and prior periods is subject to adjustment based upon the outcome of such audits 
the company believes it has adequately accrued for all probable income taxes payable 
accrual of income taxes payable and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are estimates subject to change based upon the outcome of future events 
the company has entered into tax allocation agreements with its subsidiary entities included in the consolidated us federal and unitary and combined state income tax returns 
these agreements govern the timing and amount of income tax payments required by the various entities 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb released fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in the application of income tax laws  providing a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
the company s adoption of fin on january  did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations

evaluation of securities for impairment securities are classified as held to maturity when the company has the ability and intent to hold those securities to maturity 
accordingly  they are stated at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
securities are classified as available for sale when the company may decide to sell those securities due to changes in market interest rates  liquidity needs  changes in yields or alternative investments  and for other reasons 
they are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported in other comprehensive income loss 
interest income is reported net of amortization of premium and accretion of discount 
realized gains and losses on the disposition of securities available for sale 
table of contents are based on the net proceeds and the adjusted carrying amounts of the securities sold  using the specific identification method 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are recognized in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary losses  management considers the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements where the fasb had previously concluded in those pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas no 
does not require any new financial assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  january  for the company  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company has determined that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position 
in february  fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of sfas no 
 which creates a fair value option allowing an entity to irrevocably elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain financial assets and financial liabilities  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as they occur 
sfas no 
also requires an entity to report those financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in a manner that separates those reported fair values from the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities measured using another measurement attribute on the face of the statement of financial position 
lastly  sfas no 
requires an entity to provide information that would allow users to understand the effect on earnings due to changes in the fair value on those instruments selected for the fair value election 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  january  for the company 
the company has not elected to use the fair value option under sfas no 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  to provide guidance in the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
requires registrants to quantify an error under two methods quantify the misstatement based on the amount of the error originating in the current year income statement rollover approach and quantify the misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year irrespective of the misstatement s year s origination iron curtain approach 
consequently  a registrant s financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material  after considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
sab no 
was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after november  the application of sab no 
as of january  did not have any impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which replaces the current standard on business combinations  modifies the accounting for business combinations and requires  with limited exceptions  the acquirer in a business combination to recognize all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair value 
sfas no 
r also requires certain contingent assets and liabilities acquired as well as contingent consideration to be recognized at fair value 
in addition  the statement requires payments to third parties for consulting  legal  audit  and similar services associated with an acquisition to be recognized as expenses when incurred rather than capitalized as part of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and early adoption is not permitted

collateral based classification 
during the fourth quarter of  the company revised its classification of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans  changing its prior practice of classifying as commercial real estate loans all loans to a business that included real estate as collateral collateral based classification 
the classification of construction  home equity  and residential mortgages were also reviewed 
the new method of presentation source of repayment classification recognizes that loans to owner occupied businesses engaged in manufacturing  sales and or services are commercial loans  regardless of whether real estate is taken as collateral 
these loans generally have a lower risk 
table of contents profile than traditional commercial real estate loans 
they are primarily dependent on the borrower s business generated cash flows for repayment  not on the conversion of real estate that may be pledged as collateral 
loans related to rental income producing properties and properties intended to be sold will continue to be classified as commercial real estate loans 
completing this change in methodology involved a loan by loan review of the company s commercial and commercial real estate loans 
the new presentation methodology is being implemented only as of december  and prospectively  as it is impracticable to apply it to prior years data

there were no loans held for sale at december  compared to million at december  in july  the company entered into a joint marketing arrangement with a leading privately held mortgage bank in chicago and exited the mortgage banking business resulting in no loans held for sale at year end management believes that this arrangement will enable the company to provide better pricing to its customers while also providing the company with a high quality source of additional loan volume 
the company attempts to balance the types of loans in its portfolio with the objective of managing risk 
some of the risks the company evaluates in its lending business include the primary risks associated with commercial loans are the quality of the borrower s management  financial strength and cash flow resources  and the impact of local economic factors 
risks associated with real estate loans include concentrations of loans in a certain loan type  such as commercial or residential  and fluctuating land and property values 
consumer loans also have risks associated with concentrations of loans in a single type of loan  as well as the risk a borrower may become unemployed as a result of deteriorating economic conditions 
the company does not hold any sub prime loans in its portfolio 
loan maturities the following table sets forth the remaining maturities  based upon contractual dates  for selected loan categories source of repayment classification as of december  one year years over years or less fixed variable fixed variable total in thousands commercial construction commercial real estate home equity other consumer residential mortgage total loans  gross net deferred fees total loans nonaccrual loans the company s financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on its loan portfolio 
the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time a loan is days past due unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection 
past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan 
in all cases  loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off is reversed against interest income 
the interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual 
a loan is returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 

table of contents under sfas no 
and no 
 the company currently defines loans that are individually evaluated for impairment to include commercial  commercial real estate and agricultural loans over  where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification 
all other smaller balance loans with similar attributes are evaluated for impairment in total 
the classification of a loan as impaired or nonaccrual does not necessarily indicate that the principal is uncollectible  in whole or in part 
subject to the de minimus level noted above  the company makes a determination as to the collectibility on a case by case basis based upon the specific facts of each situation 
the company considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect impaired or nonaccrual loans 
alternatives that are typically considered to collect impaired or nonaccrual loans are foreclosure  collection under guarantees  loan restructuring  or judicial collection actions 
loans that are considered to be impaired are reduced to the present value of expected future cash flows or to the fair value of the related collateral by allocating a portion of the allowance to such loans 
if these allocations require an increase to be made to the allowance for loan losses  such increases are included in the provision for loan losses charged to expense 
the following table sets forth information on the company s nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets as of the indicated dates 
december  dollars in thousands impaired and other loans days past due and accruing nonaccrual and impaired loans not accruing foreclosed properties total nonperforming assets total nonaccrual loans to total loans total nonperforming assets to total loans and foreclosed properties total nonperforming assets to total assets during   and  the company recognized interest income on impaired loans of million  million  and million  respectively

the borrower s corporate entities have filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the company continues to aggressively pursue collection through the court system and the liquidation of collateral to pay down these loans 
while the current carrying value of these loans at december  reflects management s best current estimate of net realizable value  there can be no assurance that additional losses may not be incurred 
foreclosed properties decreased to million in from million in there were no additions to foreclosed properties in foreclosed properties are carried at their estimated net realizable value 
total nonperforming assets increased by million from million in to million in

analysis of allowance for loan losses the company recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  and in the case of a collateralized loan  the quality of the collateral 
the allowance for loan losses represents the company s estimate of the amount deemed necessary to provide for probable incurred losses in the portfolio 
in making this determination  the company analyzes the ultimate collectibility of the loans in its portfolio by incorporating feedback provided by internal loan staff 
the company makes an ongoing evaluation as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis  management of the bank meets to review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
each loan officer grades his or her individual commercial credits and the company s independent loan review personnel review the officers grades 
in the event that the loan is downgraded during this review  the loan is included in the allowance analysis at the lower grade 
the grading system is in compliance with the regulatory classifications  and the allowance is allocated to the loans based on the regulatory grading  except in instances where there are known differences eg  collateral value is nominal 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of 
table of contents homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
the company s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses represents an estimation performed pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the allowance reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category 
the specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of commercial  commercial real estate and agricultural loans over  where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification 
these analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations and changes in portfolio mix and volume and other qualitative factors 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examinations  may require the company to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
the process for determining the allowance which management believes adequately considers all of the potential factors which potentially result in credit losses includes subjective elements and  therefore  may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect the company s earnings or financial position in future periods

see footnote to the table on the previous page 
the company had a reserve for losses on unfunded commitments of  at december  and the company utilizes an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets 
at each scheduled bank board of directors meeting  a watch list is presented  showing significant loan relationships listed by internal risk rating as special mention  substandard  and doubtful 
set forth below is a discussion of each of these classifications 
special mention a special mention extension of credit is defined as having potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention 
if left uncorrected  these potential weaknesses may  at some future date  result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit or the institution s credit position 
special mention credits are not considered as part of the classified extensions of credit category and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification 
they are currently protected but are potentially weak 
they constitute an undue and unwarranted credit risk 
loans in this category have some identifiable problem but  in management s opinion  offer no immediate risk of loss 
an extension of credit that is not delinquent also may be identified as special mention 
these loans are classified due to bank management s actions or the servicing of the loan 
the lending officer may be unable to properly supervise the credit because of an inadequate loan or credit agreement 
there may be questions regarding the condition of and or control over collateral 
economic or market conditions may unfavorably affect the obligor in the future 
a declining trend in the obligor s operations or an imbalanced position in the balance sheet may exist  although it is not to the point that repayment is jeopardized 
another example of a special mention credit is one that has other deviations from prudent lending practices 
if the bank may have to consider relying on a secondary or alternative source of repayment  then collection may not yet be in jeopardy  but the loan may be considered special mention 
other trends that indicate that the loan may deteriorate further include such red flags as continuous overdrafts  negative trends on a financial statement  such as a deficit net worth  a delay in the receipt of financial statements  accounts receivable ageings  etc 
these loans on a regular basis can be days or more past due 
judgments  tax liens  delinquent real estate taxes  cancellation of insurance policies and exceptions to bank policies are other red flags 
substandard a substandard extension of credit is one inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
extensions of credit so classified must have a 
table of contents well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
in other words  there is more than a normal risk of loss 
loss potential  while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard credits  does not have to exist in individual extensions of credit classified substandard 
the likelihood that a substandard loan will be paid from the primary source of repayment may also be uncertain 
financial deterioration is underway and very close attention is warranted to insure that the loan is collected without a loss 
the bank may be relying on a secondary source of repayment  such as liquidating collateral  or collecting on guarantees 
the borrower cannot keep up with either the interest or principal payments 
if the bank is forced into a subordinated or unsecured position due to flaws in documentation  the loan may also be substandard 
if the loan must be restructured  or interest rate concessions made  it should be classified as such 
if the bank is contemplating foreclosure or legal action  the credit is likely substandard 
doubtful an extension of credit classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
the possibility of loss is extremely high  however  because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and strengthen the credit  its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined 
pending factors may include a proposed merger or acquisition  liquidation proceedings  capital injection  perfecting liens on additional collateral  or refinancing plans 
if the primary source of repayment is gone  and there is doubt as to the quality of the secondary source  then the loan will be considered doubtful 
if a court suit is pending  and is the only means of collection  a loan is generally doubtful 
as stated above  the loss amount in this category is often undeterminable  and the loan is classified doubtful until said loss can be determined 
the company s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the bank s primary regulators in the course of its regulatory examinations  which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request the company to materially increase its allowance for loan losses 
although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary 
the company s allowance for loan losses at december  is considered by management to be adequate 
the company holds certain loans that are accounted for under statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop  which addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
it includes loans acquired in purchase business combinations and applies to all nongovernmental entities 
sop does not apply to loans originated by the company 
the company s assessment identified million in acquired loans to which the application of the provisions of sop was required 
as a result of the application of sop  the company recorded purchase accounting adjustments reflecting a reduction in loans of million related to acquired impaired loans  thus reducing the carrying value of these loans to million as of december  see note business combinations to the consolidated financials statements 
securities the company manages its securities portfolio to provide a source of both liquidity and earnings 
the company has an asset liability committee which develops current investment policies based upon its operating needs and market circumstances 
the investment policy of the bank is reviewed by senior financial management of the company in terms of its objectives  investment guidelines and consistency with overall company performance and risk management goals 
the bank s investment policy is formally reviewed and approved annually by its board of directors 
the asset liability committee of the bank is responsible for reporting and monitoring compliance with the investment policy 
reports are provided to the bank s board of directors and the board of directors of the company on a regular basis 

table of contents the following tables set forth the composition of the company s securities portfolio by major category as of the indicated dates

the total fair value of the securities portfolio was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with related unrealized net gains or losses  net of deferred income taxes  recorded as an adjustment to equity capital 
at december   unrealized losses on securities available for sale were million  or million net of taxes  compared to million  or million net of taxes  at december  due to the change in the interest rate environment as well as turbulent economic conditions impacting the credit markets in the second half of of the million  million was related to perpetual preferred equity securities issued by fnma and fhlmc which were rated aa or better by either moody s or s p at december  and  and carry tax equivalent yields averaging 
the unrealized losses on these securities increased significantly in late  peaking in mid november as a result of unfavorable economic news  mostly related to declines in the sub prime mortgage market  the housing slump  and a series of major corrections in the marketplace 
both of these government sponsored entities raised substantial new equity capital through the issuance of additional preferred stock in late  which the company believes shows investors confidence in the issuers strength  long term viability and ability to fund dividends 
despite the period of time these securities have been impaired and the magnitude of the decline in value  the company believes it is too soon as of december  to conclude that the unrealized losses are other than temporary in nature and further believes as of december  that the market fluctuations that precipitated the steep drop in values in late will reverse over time 
the price performance of these securities subsequent to year end has  however  been choppy 
if a pattern of recovery does not appear in the near future  the company would be required to recognize impairment losses

deposits the company competes for core deposits in the heavily banked chicago metropolitan statistical area 
competitive pricing has made it difficult to maintain and grow these types of deposits 
the level of pressure for core deposits is not expected to ease in the near term 
to overcome this challenge  the company has changed and expanded staffing and management at its banking centers and initiated a number of customer outreach initiatives to expand deposits 
in addition  the company is in the process of creating a performance driven sales environment and increasing activity in its branches 
deposit growth is expected in the future as new customers are added due to the addition of new small business and commercial and industrial loans and a commitment to relationship banking

during  the company acquired million in junior subordinated debentures at libor plus through the acquisition of northwest suburban effective october  and redeemed million in junior subordinated debentures at libor plus on november  liquidity the company manages its liquidity position with the objective of maintaining access to sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million 
in addition to the normal inflow of funds from its securities portfolio  and repayments and maturities of loans and securities  the company utilizes other short term  intermediate term and long term funding sources such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase  overnight funds purchased from correspondent banks 
the fhlb provides an additional source of liquidity which has been used by the bank extensively since the bank also has various funding arrangements with commercial and investment banks in the form of federal funds lines  repurchase agreements  and brokered and public funds certificate of deposit programs 
the bank maintains these funding arrangements to achieve favorable costs of funds  manage interest rate risk  and enhance liquidity in the event of deposit withdrawals 
the repurchase agreements and public funds certificate of deposit are subject to the availability of collateral 
the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its current and future liquidity needs 
the company monitors and manages its liquidity position on several levels  which vary depending upon the time period 
as the time period is expanded  other data is factored in  including estimated loan funding requirements  estimated loan payoffs  securities portfolio maturities or calls  and anticipated depository buildups or runoffs 
the company classifies the majority of its securities as available for sale  thereby maintaining significant liquidity 
certain available for sale securities were temporarily impaired at december   primarily due to changes in interest rates as well as current economic conditions that appear to be cyclical in nature 
the company has both the intent and ability to hold each of the temporarily impaired securities for the time necessary to recover its amortized cost 
see the securities section and risk factors for more details 
the company s liquidity position is further enhanced by the structuring of a majority of its loan portfolio interest payments as monthly and also by the representation of residential mortgage loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the company s cash flows are composed of three classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  and cash flows from financing activities

all of the financial instruments of the company as of december  were held for other than trading purposes 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s net interest income is dependent on the amounts of and yields on its interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is therefore sensitive to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s asset liability management strategy is to maximize net interest income while limiting exposure to risks associated with changes in interest rates 
this strategy is implemented by the company s 
table of contents ongoing analysis and management of its interest rate risk 
a principal function of asset liability management is to coordinate the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to manage net interest income fluctuations within limits in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals and interest rate indices of the interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments are different  thus creating a risk that will result in disproportionate changes in the value of and the net earnings generated from the company s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through the company s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that generate favorable earnings while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
because the company s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  the company s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer maturity preferences in the market areas in which the company operates 
over the past few years  several hundred new bank branches have opened in the company s marketplace 
deposit pricing is competitive with promotional rates frequently offered by competitors 
ongoing competition for core and time deposits are driving up yields paid 
borrowings  which include fhlb advances  short term borrowings  and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms which  in management s judgment  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the rates  terms  and interest rate indices of the company s interest earning assets result primarily from the company s strategy of investing in securities and loans a substantial portion of which have adjustable rates 
this permits the company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread from the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
management uses a duration model for the bank s internal asset liability management 
the model uses cash flows and repricing information from loans and certificates of deposit  plus repricing assumptions on products without specific repricing dates eg  savings and interest bearing demand deposits  to calculate the durations of the bank s assets and liabilities 
securities are stress tested  and the theoretical changes in cash flow are key elements of the company s model 
the model also projects the effect on the company s earnings and theoretical value for a change in interest rates 
the model computes the duration of the bank s rate sensitive assets and liabilities  a theoretical market value of the bank s rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the effects of rate changes on the bank s earnings and market value 
the bank s exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a monthly basis by senior management and the company s board of directors 
effects of inflation interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but it is difficult to assess the impact  since neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes in the various inflation indices coincide with changes in interest rates 
inflation does impact the economic value of longer term  interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  but the company attempts to limit its long term assets and liabilities  as indicated in the tables set forth under financial condition and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company performs a net interest income analysis as part of its asset liability management practices 
net interest income analysis measures the change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
this analysis assesses the risk of change in net interest income in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in market interest rates 
the tables below present the company s projected changes in net interest income for the various rate shock levels at december  and december   respectively 
change in net interest income over one year horizon guideline december  december  maximum dollar dollar change change change change change dollars in thousands bp bp bp bp as shown above  at december   the effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the company s net interest income by  or million 
the effect of an immediate basis point reduction in rates would decrease the company s net interest income by  or million 
overall net interest income sensitivity remains within the company s and recommended regulatory guidelines 
the changes in the company s net interest income sensitivity were due  in large part  to the prudent addition of optionality on both sides of the balance sheet 
the changes in net interest income over the one year horizon for december  under the and increases and decreases in market interest rates scenarios are reflective of this optionality 
in a rising rate environment  the callable us government sponsored entity debentures in the securities portfolio would remain at a fixed rate of return as fundings costs rise 
conversely  if interest rates decline  these securities would be called and the proceeds would be re invested at lower levels 
similarly  a managed amount of structured borrowings has been added to the wholesale funding position  which added volatility to net interest income 
the company believes it manages such volatility to acceptable levels and is being appropriately compensated for the additional risk 
during much of and  the competitive landscape of banking in chicago resulted in certificate of deposit pricing that management believed to be significantly above market 
rather than compete for higher cost retail certificates of deposit  management chose to pursue funding opportunities in the wholesale markets 
these opportunities were not only lower in cost  but allowed the company to more precisely manage the rate and term structure of its funding liabilities 
throughout  the company continued to selectively offer special promotions to attract retail deposits as needed 
the company does not have any sub prime or alt a mortgage backed securities in its securities portfolio nor does it have any sub prime loans 
gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities as of december  
table of contents  and provides the repricing dates of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of that date  as well as the company s interest rate sensitivity gap percentages for the periods presented 
over months months years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets federal funds sold and other short term investments securities available for sale  at fair value securities held to maturity  at amortized cost federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits money market deposits savings deposits time deposits total interest bearing deposits federal funds purchased securities sold under agreements to repurchase advances from the federal home loan bank junior subordinated debentures notes payable total borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap interest sensitivity gap to total assets cumulative interest sensitivity gap to total assets this chart shows that the company is mismatched over the zero to month time horizon 
that is  there were more liabilities repricing or maturing within these periods than assets repricing or maturing 
the gap position does not necessarily indicate the company s interest rate sensitivity or the impact to net interest income because interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are repricing off of different indices 
mortgage backed securities  including adjustable rate mortgage pools  are included in the above table based on their estimated principal paydowns obtained from outside analytical sources 
loans are included in the above table based on contractual maturity or contractual repricing dates 
deposits are based on management s analysis of industry trends and customer behavior 

table of contents computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay rates 
these computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
actual values may differ from those projections set forth above  should market conditions vary from assumptions used in preparing the analyses 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the gap analysis is based upon assumptions as to when assets and liabilities will reprice in a changing interest rate environment 
because such assumptions can be no more than estimates  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes than those estimated 
also  the renewal or repricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
therefore  the gap table included above does not and cannot necessarily indicate the actual future impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income
