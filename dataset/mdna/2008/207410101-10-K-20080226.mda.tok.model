sales of surgical products aggregated approximately of our total net revenues in see products 
continued pressure to reduce health care costs 
in response to rising health care costs  managed care companies and other third party payers have placed pressures on health care providers to reduce costs 
as a result  health care providers have focused on the high cost areas such as surgery 
to reduce costs  health care providers use minimally invasive techniques  which generally reduce patient trauma  recovery time and ultimately the length of hospitalization 
approximately of our products are designed for use in minimally invasive surgical procedures 
see products 
health care providers are also increasingly purchasing single use  disposable products  which reduce the costs associated with sterilizing surgical instruments and products following surgery 
the single use nature of disposable products lowers the risk of incorrectly sterilized instruments spreading infection into the patient and increasing the cost of post operative care 
approximately of our sales are derived from single use disposable products 

table of contents in the united states  the pressure on health care providers to contain costs has caused many health care providers to enter into comprehensive purchasing contracts with fewer suppliers  which offer a broader array of products at lower prices

our financial performance is subject to the risks inherent in our acquisition strategy  including the effects of increased borrowing and integration of newly acquired businesses or product lines 
a key element of our business strategy has been to expand through acquisitions and we may seek to pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
our success is dependent in part upon our ability to integrate acquired companies or product lines into our existing operations 
we may not have sufficient management and other resources to accomplish the integration of our past and future acquisitions and implementing our acquisition strategy may strain our relationship with customers  suppliers  distributors  manufacturing personnel or others 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and make acquisitions on acceptable terms or that we will be able to obtain financing for such acquisitions on acceptable terms 
in addition  while we are generally entitled to customary indemnification from sellers of businesses for any difficulties that may have arisen prior to our acquisition of each business  acquisitions may involve exposure to unknown liabilities and the amount and time for claiming under these indemnification provisions is often limited 
as a result  our financial performance is now and will continue to be subject to various risks associated with the acquisition of businesses  including the financial effects associated with any increased borrowing required to fund such acquisitions or with the integration of such businesses 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in recalls  fines or materially adverse implications 
all of our products are classified as medical devices subject to regulation by the fda 
as a manufacturer of medical devices  our manufacturing processes and facilities are subject to on site inspection and continuing review by the fda for compliance with the quality system regulations 
manufacturing and sales of our products outside the united states are also subject to foreign regulatory requirements which vary from country to country 
moreover  we are generally required to obtain regulatory clearance or approval prior to marketing a new product 
the time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval  and requirements for foreign approvals may differ from fda requirements 
failure to comply with applicable domestic and or foreign regulatory requirements may result in 
table of contents fines or other enforcement actions  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawal of existing product approvals or clearances  refusal to approve or clear new applications or notices  increased quality control costs  or criminal prosecution 
failure to comply with quality system regulations and applicable foreign regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are not able to manufacture products in compliance with regulatory standards  we may decide to cease manufacturing of those products and may be subject to product recall 
in addition to the quality system regulations  many of our products are also subject to industry defined standards 
we may not be able to comply with these regulations and standards due to deficiencies in component parts or our manufacturing processes 
if we are not able to comply with the quality system regulations or industry defined standards  we may not be able to fill customer orders and we may decide to cease production of non compliant products 
failure to produce products could affect our profit margins and could lead to loss of customers 
our products are subject to product recall and we have made product recalls in the past 
although no recall has had a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  we cannot assure you that regulatory issues will not have a material adverse effect in the future or that product recalls will not harm our reputation and our customer relationships 
the highly competitive market for our products may create adverse pricing pressures 
the market for our products is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives of supply 
many of our competitors offer a range of products in areas other than those in which we compete  which may make such competitors more attractive to surgeons  hospitals  group purchasing organizations and others 
in addition  several of our competitors are large  technically competent firms with substantial assets 
competitive pricing pressures or the introduction of new products by our competitors could have an adverse effect on our revenues 
see competition for a further discussion of these competitive forces 

table of contents factors which may influence our customers choice of competitor products include changes in surgeon preferences  increases or decreases in health care spending related to medical devices  our inability to supply products to them  as a result of product recall  market withdrawal or back order  the introduction by competitors of new products or new features to existing products  the introduction by competitors of alternative surgical technology  and advances in surgical procedures  discoveries or developments in the health care industry 
we use a variety of raw materials in our businesses  and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 
our reliance on certain suppliers and commodity markets to secure raw materials used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of raw materials 
in some instances  we participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers 
a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers  price increases  or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities  could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs 
we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices 
nonetheless  price increases or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
cost reduction efforts in the health care industry could put pressures on our prices and margins 
in recent years  the health care industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs 
such efforts include national health care reform  trends towards managed care  cuts in medicare  consolidation of health care distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by gpos and ihns 
demand and prices for our products may be adversely affected by such trends 
we may not be able to keep pace with technological change or to successfully develop new products with wide market acceptance  which could cause us to lose business to competitors 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology 
our future financial performance will depend in part on our ability to develop and manufacture new products on a cost effective basis  to introduce them to the market on a timely basis  and to have them accepted by surgeons 
we may not be able to keep pace with technology or to develop viable new products 
factors which may result in delays of new product introductions or cancellation of our plans to manufacture and market new products include capital constraints  research and development delays  
table of contents delays in securing regulatory approvals  or changes in the competitive landscape  including the emergence of alternative products or solutions which reduce or eliminate the markets for pending products 
our new products may fail to achieve expected levels of market acceptance 
new product introductions may fail to achieve market acceptance 
the degree of market acceptance for any of our products will depend upon a number of factors  including our ability to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in the time frames we currently estimate  our ability to successfully implement new technologies  the market s readiness to accept new products  having adequate financial and technological resources for future product development and promotion  the efficacy of our products  and the prices of our products compared to the prices of our competitors products 
if our new products do not achieve market acceptance  we may be unable to recover our investments and may lose business to competitors 
in addition  some of the companies with which we now compete or may compete in the future have or may have more extensive research  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and significantly greater technical and personnel resources than we do  and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry 
see competition for a further discussion of these competitive forces 
our senior credit agreement contains covenants which may limit our flexibility or prevent us from taking actions 
our senior credit agreement contains  and future credit facilities are expected to contain  certain restrictive covenants which will affect  and in many respects significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  pay dividends or make other distributions on  or redeem or repurchase  capital stock  sell assets  and pursue acquisitions 
these covenants  unless waived  may prevent us from pursuing acquisitions  significantly limit our operating and financial flexibility and limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities 
our ability to comply with such provisions may be affected by events beyond our control 
in the event of any default under our credit agreement  the credit agreement lenders may elect to declare all amounts borrowed under our credit agreement  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable 
if we were unable to repay such borrowings  the credit agreement lenders could proceed against collateral securing the credit agreement  which consists of substantially all of our property and assets  except for our accounts receivable and related rights which are sold in connection with the accounts receivable sales agreement 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of the accounts receivable sales agreement 
our credit agreement also contains a material adverse effect clause which may limit our ability to access additional funding under our credit agreement should a material adverse change in our business occur 

table of contents our substantial leverage and debt service requirements may require us to adopt alternative business strategies 
we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders equity  as well as interest and debt service requirements that are significant compared to our cash flow from operations 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding  representing of total capitalization and which does not include the million of accounts receivable sold under the accounts receivable sales agreement 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to investors  including but not limited to the following a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service and will not be available for operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends and other purposes  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be limited or impaired  or may be at higher interest rates  we may be at a competitive disadvantage when compared to competitors that are less leveraged  we may be hindered in our ability to adjust rapidly to market conditions  our degree of leverage could make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or other adverse circumstances applicable to us  and our interest expense could increase if interest rates in general increase because a portion of our borrowings  including our borrowings under our credit agreement  are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness  which could require us to reduce our expenditures  sell assets  restructure our indebtedness or seek additional equity capital 
our ability to satisfy our obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we may not have sufficient cash flow available to enable us to meet our obligations 
if we are unable to service our indebtedness  we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as foregoing acquisitions  reducing or delaying capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital 
we cannot assure you that any of these strategies could be implemented on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our indebtedness and its implications 

table of contents we may be unable to continue to sell our accounts receivable  which could require us to seek alternative sources of financing 
under our accounts receivable sales agreement  there are certain statistical ratios which must be maintained relating to the pool of receivables in order for us to continue selling to the purchaser 
these ratios relate to sales dilution and losses on accounts receivable 
if new accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business do not qualify for sale or the purchaser otherwise ceases to purchase our receivables  we may require access to alternate sources of working capital  which may be more expensive or difficult to obtain 
our accounts receivable sales agreement  as amended  also requires us to obtain a commitment the purchaser commitment from the purchaser to fund the purchase of our accounts receivable 
the purchaser commitment was amended effective december  whereby it was extended through october  under substantially the same terms and conditions 
in the event we are unable to renew our purchaser commitment in the future  we would need to access alternate sources of working capital which may be more expensive or difficult to obtain 
if we infringe third parties patents  or if we lose our patents or they are held to be invalid  we could become subject to liability and our competitive position could be harmed 
much of the technology used in the markets in which we compete is covered by patents 
we have numerous us patents and corresponding foreign patents on products expiring at various dates from through and have additional patent applications pending 
see research and development for a further description of our patents 
the loss of our patents could reduce the value of the related products and any related competitive advantage 
competitors may also be able to design around our patents and to compete effectively with our products 
in addition  the cost of enforcing our patents against third parties and defending our products against patent infringement actions by others could be substantial 
we cannot assure you that pending patent applications will result in issued patents  patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged by competitors  our patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with a competitive advantage  or we will be successful in defending against pending or future patent infringement claims asserted against our products 
ordering patterns of our customers may change resulting in reductions in sales 
our hospital and surgery center customers purchase our products in quantities sufficient to meet their anticipated demand 
likewise  our health care distributor customers purchase our products for ultimate resale to health care providers in quantities sufficient to meet the anticipated requirements of the distributors customers 
should inventories of our products owned by our hospital  surgery center and distributor customers grow to levels higher than their requirements  our customers may reduce the ordering of products from us 
this could result in reduced sales during a financial accounting period 

table of contents our significant international operations subject us to risks associated with operating in foreign countries 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from foreign sales 
as a result  our international presence exposes us to certain inherent risks  including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  imposition of limitations on conversions of foreign currencies into dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by international subsidiaries  imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries  trade barriers  political risks  including political instability  reliance on third parties to distribute our products  hyperinflation in certain foreign countries  and imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments 
we cannot assure you that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we can be sued for producing defective products and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover the nature and amount of any product liability claims 
the nature of our products as medical devices and today s litigious environment should be regarded as potential risks which could significantly and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the insurance we maintain to protect against claims associated with the use of our products have deductibles and may not adequately cover the amount or nature of any claim asserted against us 
we are also exposed to the risk that our insurers may become insolvent or that premiums may increase substantially 
see legal proceedings for a further discussion of the risk of product liability actions and our insurance coverage 
damage to our physical properties as a result of windstorm  earthquake  fire or other natural or man made disaster may cause a financial loss and a loss of customers 
although we maintain insurance coverage for physical damage to our property and the resultant losses that could occur during a business interruption  we are required to pay deductibles and our insurance coverage is limited to certain caps 
for example  our deductible for windstorm damage to our florida property amounts to of any loss and coverage for earthquake damage to our california properties is limited to million 
further  while insurance reimburses us for our lost gross earnings during a business interruption  if we are unable to supply our customers with our products for an extended period of time  there can be no assurance that we will regain the customers business once the product supply is returned to normal

table of contents item legal proceedings from time to time  we are a defendant in certain lawsuits alleging product liability  patent infringement  or other claims incurred in the ordinary course of business 
likewise  from time to time  the company may receive a subpoena from a government agency such as the equal employment opportunity commission  occupational safety and health administration  the department of labor  the treasury department  and other federal and state agencies or foreign governments or government agencies 
these subpoenae may or may not be routine inquiries  or may begin as routine inquiries and over time develop into enforcement actions of various types 
the product liability claims are generally covered by various insurance policies  subject to certain deductible amounts and maximum policy limits 
when there is no insurance coverage  as would typically be the case primarily in lawsuits alleging patent infringement or in connection with certain government investigations  we establish reserves sufficient to cover probable losses associated with such claims 
we do not expect that the resolution of any pending claims or investigations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
there can be no assurance  however  that future claims or investigations  or the costs associated with responding to such claims or investigations  especially claims and investigations not covered by insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on our future performance 
manufacturers of medical products may face exposure to significant product liability claims 
to date  we have not experienced any product liability claims that are material to our financial statements or condition  but any such claims arising in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we currently maintain commercial product liability insurance of million per incident and million in the aggregate annually  which we believe is adequate 
this coverage is on a claims made basis 
there can be no assurance that claims will not exceed insurance coverage or that such insurance will be available in the future at a reasonable cost to us 
our operations are subject  and in the past have been subject  to a number of environmental laws and regulations governing  among other things  air emissions  wastewater discharges  the use  handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  soil and groundwater remediation and employee health and safety 
in some jurisdictions environmental requirements may be expected to become more stringent in the future 
in the united states certain environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of site restoration upon each of the parties that may have contributed to conditions at the site regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the party s activities 
while we do not believe that the present costs of environmental compliance and remediation are material  there can be no assurance that future compliance or remedial obligations could not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
on april   conmed received a copy of a complaint filed in the united states district for the northern district of new york on behalf of a purported class of former conmed linvatec sales representatives 
the complaint alleges that the former sales representatives were entitled to  but did not receive  severance in when conmed linvatec restructured its distribution channels 
although we do not believe it is probable a loss has been incurred  it is reasonably possible 
the range of loss associated with this complaint ranges from to million  not including any interest  fees or costs that might be awarded if the five named plaintiffs were to prevail on their own behalf as well as on behalf of the approximately or as alleged by the plaintiffs other members of the purported class 
conmed linvatec did not generally pay severance during the restructuring because the former sales representatives were offered sales positions with conmed linvatec s new manufacturer s representatives 
other than three of the five named plaintiffs in the class action  nearly all of conmed linvatec s former sales representatives accepted such positions 

table of contents the company s motions to dismiss and for summary judgment  which were heard at a hearing held on january   were denied by a memorandum decision and order dated may  the district court also granted the plaintiffs motion to certify a class of former conmed linvatec sales representatives whose employment with conmed linvatec was involuntarily terminated in and who did not receive severance benefits 
although the court s ruling on the motions to dismiss  for summary judgment and the motion to certify the class do not represent final rulings on the merits  the company had filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the motions to dismiss  and sought to appeal to the united state court of appeals for the second circuit from the class certification ruling 
the second circuit declined to consider the appeal by order dated august  in an order dated february   the united states district for the northern district of new york granted the company s motion to reconsider the company s motions to dismiss portions of the complaint and  upon reconsideration  reaffirmed its previous ruling denying the aforementioned motions 
the company believes there is no merit to the claims asserted in the complaint  and plans to vigorously defend the case 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will prevail in the litigation 
the company had been defending a product liability claim asserted against it and several of the company s subsidiaries in a case captioned wehner v 
linvatec corp  et al the wehner case 
two of the company s subsidiaries settled the case and accrued the expenses  including both the settlement and certain defense costs  in the fourth quarter of in the amount of million 
as a result of the settlement  all of the claims against all of the company s entities will be dismissed with prejudice 
as the occurrence giving rise to the wehner case occurred in prior to the company s acquisition of bionx implants  inc  the wehner case is not covered by the company s current product liability insurance policy 
the former product liability insurance carrier has denied coverage  and the company and its subsidiaries commenced suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania seeking a declaration that the underlying claim is covered by the policy 
the company and its subsidiaries plan to vigorously pursue the claims for insurance coverage ie  for reimbursement of the costs of defending and settling the wehner case  although there can be no assurance that the company and its subsidiaries will prevail

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data item  and our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
overview of conmed corporation conmed corporation conmed  the company  we or us is a medical technology company with an emphasis on surgical devices and equipment for minimally invasive procedures and monitoring 
the company s products serve the clinical areas of arthroscopy  powered surgical instruments  electrosurgery  cardiac monitoring disposables  endosurgery and endoscopic technologies 
they are used by surgeons and physicians in a variety of specialties including orthopedics  general surgery  gynecology  neurosurgery  and gastroenterology 
these product lines and the percentage of consolidated revenues associated with each  are as follows arthroscopy powered surgical instruments electrosurgery patient care endosurgery endoscopic technologies consolidated net sales a significant amount of our products are used in surgical procedures with approximately of our revenues derived from the sale of disposable products 
our capital equipment offerings also facilitate the ongoing sale of related disposable products and accessories  thus providing us with a recurring revenue stream 
we manufacture substantially all of our products in facilities located in the united states  mexico and finland 
we market our products both domestically and internationally directly to customers and through distributors 
international sales approximated  and in  and  respectively 
business environment and opportunities the aging of the worldwide population along with lifestyle changes  continued cost containment pressures on healthcare systems and the desire of clinicians and administrators to use less invasive or noninvasive procedures are important trends which are driving the growth in our industry 
we believe that with our broad product offering of high quality surgical and patient care products  we can capitalize on this growth for the benefit of the company and our shareholders 
in order to further our growth prospects  we have historically used strategic business acquisitions and exclusive distribution relationships to continue to diversify our product offerings  increase our market share and realize economies of scale 

table of contents we have a variety of research and development initiatives focused in each of our principal product lines 
among the most significant of these efforts is the endotracheal cardiac output monitor ecom 
our ecom product offering is expected to provide an innovative alternative to catheter monitoring of cardiac output with a specially designed endotracheal tube which utilizes proprietary bio impedance technology 
also of significance are our research and development efforts in the area of tissue sealing for electrosurgery 
continued innovation and commercialization of new proprietary products and processes are essential elements of our long term growth strategy 
in march  we expect to be unveiling several new products at the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons annual meeting which we believe will further enhance our arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument product offerings 
our reputation as an innovator is exemplified by these product introductions  which include the following the spectrum mvp shoulder suture passer  an innovative suture passing device for arthroscopic shoulder repair  the sentinel drill bits which allows for safe and accurate drilling into the femoral tunnels during anterior cruciate ligament  or acl  surgery  the shutt series instruments for hip arthroscopy  which include nine manual instruments allowing for working in deep joints such as the hip  el microfracture awls and sterilization tray which is for easier access in difficult to reach areas and use in hip arthroscopy  smart screw ii  a comprehensive line of bioabsorbable bone fixation implants  threvo with hifi  a shoulder anchor that incorporates the advantage of the hifi high strength suture  cordless revision attachment for battery handpieces  which are the only cordless revision attachments on the market and are used for cement removal in orthopedic revision surgery  intrex blade line  a blade system composed of six blade profiles in seven different thicknesses for a comprehensive system of large bone saw blades  hd arthroscope  the first high definition  or hd  arthroscope on the market ensures maximized transmission of high contrast light from the arthroscope into the true hd camera head  and the single chip enhanced definition camera system  which incorporates a camera and image capture in the same device 
business challenges in september  we acquired the business operations of the endoscopic technologies division of cr bard  inc the endoscopic technologies acquisition for aggregate consideration of million in cash 
the acquired business has enhanced our product offerings by adding a comprehensive line of single use medical devices employed by gastro intestinal and pulmonary physicians to diagnose and treat diseases of the digestive tract and lungs using minimally invasive endoscopic techniques 
the transfer of the endoscopic technologies production lines from cr bard facilities to conmed facilities proved to be more time consuming  costly and complex than was originally anticipated 
operational issues associated with the transfer of production lines resulted in backorders  which  combined with increased competition and pricing pressures in the marketplace  have resulted in decreased sales  lower than anticipated gross margins and operating losses 
as a result of these factors  during our fourth quarter goodwill impairment testing  we determined that the goodwill of our endoscopic technologies business was impaired and consequently we recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying amount of this business to its fair value 
we have taken corrective action to resolve the operational issues associated with product shortages and now believe we have a stable supply of product to meet customer demand 
although we experienced a sales decline of for the full year in the endoscopic technologies product line  fourth quarter sales grew  which we believe signifies a return to normal growth patterns 

table of contents our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the united states food and drug administration fda for  among other things  conformance to quality system regulation and current good manufacturing practice cgmp requirements 
we are committed to the principles and strategies of systems based quality management for improved cgmp compliance  operational performance and efficiencies through our company wide quality systems initiative 
however  there can be no assurance that our actions will ensure that we will not receive a warning letter or other regulatory action which may include consent decrees or fines 
critical accounting policies preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below and are considered by management to be critical to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of conmed corporation 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title has been transferred to the customer which is at the time of shipment 
the following policies apply to our major categories of revenue transactions sales to customers are evidenced by firm purchase orders 
title and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer when product is shipped under our stated shipping terms 
payment by the customer is due under fixed payment terms 
we place certain of our capital equipment with customers in return for commitments to purchase disposable products over time periods generally ranging from one to three years 
in these circumstances  no revenue is recognized upon capital equipment shipment and we recognize revenue upon the disposable product shipment 
the cost of the equipment is amortized over the term of individual commitment agreements 
product returns are only accepted at the discretion of the company and in accordance with our returned goods policy 
historically the level of product returns has not been significant 
we accrue for sales returns  rebates and allowances based upon an analysis of historical customer returns and credits  rebates  discounts and current market conditions 
our terms of sale to customers generally do not include any obligations to perform future services 
limited warranties are provided for capital equipment sales and provisions for warranty are provided at the time of product sale based upon an analysis of historical data 
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling have been included in net sales 
shipping and handling costs included in selling and administrative expense were million  million and million for  and  respectively 

table of contents we sell to a diversified base of customers around the world and  therefore  believe there is no material concentration of credit risk 
we assess the risk of loss on accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this risk assessment 
historically  losses on accounts receivable have not been material 
management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts of million at december  is adequate to provide for probable losses resulting from accounts receivable 
inventory reserves we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the inability to sell our products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an on going basis 
such marketplace changes may result in our products becoming obsolete 
we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of our products and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we believe that our current inventory reserves are adequate 
business acquisitions we have a history of growth through acquisitions 
assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
other intangible assets primarily represent allocations of purchase price to identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
we have accumulated goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million at december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to at least annual impairment testing 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our businesses 
estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques 
future cash flows may be affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired entities 
intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
intangible assets which continue to be subject to amortization are also evaluated to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
an intangible asset is determined to be impaired when estimated undiscounted future cash flows indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the recorded value to its current fair value 
it is our policy to perform annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  after completing our annual goodwill impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill of our conmed endoscopic technologies business was impaired and consequently we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets 
pension plan we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all our employees 
major assumptions used in accounting for the plan include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of increase in employee compensation levels and expected mortality 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated annually as of the plan s measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the discount rate was determined by using the citigroup pension liability index rate which  we believe  is a reasonable indicator of our plan s future benefit payment stream 
this rate  which increased from in to in  is used in determining pension expense 
this change in assumption will result in lower pension expense during we have used an expected rate of return on pension plan assets of for purposes of determining the net periodic pension benefit cost 
in determining the expected return on pension plan assets  we consider the relative weighting of plan assets  the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance 
in addition  we consult with financial and investment management professionals in developing appropriate targeted rates of return 
we have estimated our rate of increase in employee compensation levels at consistent with our internal budgeting 
based on these and other factors  pension expense is estimated at approximately million compared to million in actual expense may vary significantly from this estimate 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plan in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
stock based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r effective january  sfas r requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock units  and stock appreciation rights be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
no compensation expense was recognized for stock options under the provisions of apb since all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the grant date 

table of contents sfas r was adopted using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  the provisions of sfas r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
in addition  compensation expense must be recognized for any nonvested stock option awards outstanding as of the date of adoption 
we recognize such expense using a straight line method over the vesting period 
prior periods have not been restated 
we elected to adopt the alternative transition method  as permitted by fasb staff position no 
fas r transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  to calculate the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r for those employee awards that were outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
the alternative transition method allows the use of a simplified method to calculate the beginning pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes the recorded future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards is approximately million at december  management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within and outside the united states 
we face audits from these various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
such audits can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve 
our federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service irs for calendar years ending through during  internal revenue service examinations were settled for tax years and the net effect of the settlement of these examinations  was a million reduction in income tax expense in we have established a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of certain net operating loss carryforwards recognized in connection with an acquisition 
any subsequently recognized tax benefits associated with the valuation allowance would be allocated to reduce goodwill 
however  upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations sfas r on january   changes in deferred tax valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date  including those associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of sfas r  generally will affect income tax expense 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 

table of contents on january  we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the impact of this pronouncement was not material to the company s consolidated financial statements

the endoscopic technologies business was acquired as a result of the endoscopic technologies acquisition and involved the transfer of substantially all of the endoscopic technologies production lines from cr bard facilities to conmed facilities 
this transfer proved to be more time consuming  costly and complex than was originally anticipated 
in addition  production and operational issues at an assembly operation in mexico under contract to conmed resulted in product shortages and backorders 
these operational issues  in combination with increased competition and pricing pressures in the marketplace resulted in decreased sales and gross margins 
the decreases in gross margin percentage attributable to patient care and endosurgery are primarily a result of significant cost increases experienced in the second half of and in with respect to certain commodity and petroleum based raw materials such as plastic resins and polymers used in the production of many of our products as well as higher spending related to quality assurance

based upon the aggregation criteria for segment reporting under statement of financial accounting standards no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  we have grouped our conmed endosurgery  conmed electrosurgery and conmed linvatec operating segments into a single reporting segment 
the economic characteristics of conmed patient care and conmed endoscopic technologies do not meet the criteria for aggregation due to the lower overall operating income loss of these segments 
the following tables summarize the company s results of operations by segment for  and conmed endosurgery  conmed electrosurgery and conmed linvatec net sales income from operations operating margin product offerings include a complete line of endo mechanical instrumentation for minimally invasive laparoscopic procedures  electrosurgical generators and related surgical instruments  arthroscopic instrumentation for use in orthopedic surgery and small bone  large bone and specialty powered surgical instruments

operating margins as a percentage of net sales decreased percentage points to in compared to in largely as a result of increased research and development spending percentage points in the conmed linvatec product lines 
the remaining percentage point decline in operating margin is due to decreased gross margins in the conmed endosurgery product lines as a result of significant cost increases experienced in the second half of and in with respect to certain commodity and petroleum based raw materials such as plastic resins and polymers used in the production of the endosurgery product lines as well as higher spending related to quality assurance 
conmed patient care net sales income loss from operations operating margin product offerings include a line of vital signs and cardiac monitoring products including pulse oximetry equipment sensors  ecg electrodes and cables  cardiac defibrillation pacing pads and blood pressure cuffs 
we also offer a complete line of reusable surgical patient positioners and suction instruments tubing for use in the operating room  as well as a line of iv products

conmed endoscopic technologies net sales income loss from operations operating margin product offerings include a comprehensive line of minimally invasive endoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic instruments used in procedures which require examination of the digestive tract 
endoscopic technologies net sales declined million in to million from million in  principally due to decreased sales of forceps and biliary products as a result of increased competition and pricing pressures as well as production and operational issues which resulted in product shortages and backorders during the first half of endoscopic technologies net sales declined million in to million from million in  principally due to lower sales in our forceps products as a result of increased competition and pricing pressures as well as production and operational issues which resulted in product shortages and backorders 
in addition  we experienced lower sales as a result of the discontinuation of our agreement with xillix technologies corporation to distribute the onco life product 
operating margins as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the increase in operating margins of percentage points in is primarily a result of the million goodwill impairment charge percentage points in in addition  gross margins increased percentage points as a result of the completion of the transfer of production lines from cr bard to conmed during the remaining increases in operating margins of percentage points are attributable to lower costs in associated with acquisition related costs percentage points  lower research and development expenses as certain biliary and other projects near completion percentage points and other selling and administrative expenses percentage points offset by charges related to closure of a sales office in france percentage points

additionally  as discussed above  production and operational issues associated with the transfer of production lines from cr bard to conmed resulted in product shortages and backorders  reduced sales and a decrease in gross margin of percentage points 
as a result of these factors and the resulting operating losses  we determined during our testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of  that the goodwill of our endoscopic technologies business was impaired  resulting in an impairment charge of million percentage points 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investments  working capital requirements and payments on indebtedness under our senior credit agreement 
we have historically met these liquidity requirements with funds generated from operations  including sales of accounts receivable and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we use term borrowings  including borrowings under our senior credit agreement and borrowings under separate loan facilities  in the case of real property purchases  to finance our acquisitions 
we also have the ability to raise funds through the sale of stock or we may issue debt through a private placement or public offering 
we generally attempt to minimize our cash balances on hand and use available cash to pay down debt or repurchase our common stock 
operating cash flows our net working capital position was million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million in as compared to the increase in net income in did not translate directly into a significant increase in operating cash flows given the non cash nature of the goodwill impairment charge recognized in the increase in net income was further offset by increases in inventory levels from their levels mainly in our arthroscopy and powered instrument product lines in anticipation of continued sales growth and to accommodate sales orders for new products as well as a million increase in funding of the pension plan in investing cash flows capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in were consistent with levels and higher than primarily due to technology upgrades including the ongoing implementation of an enterprise business software application 
capital expenditures are expected to approximate million in the purchase of a business resulted in a million payment while a purchase price adjustment resulted in a payment of million in additional consideration in the sale of an equity investment resulted in proceeds of million in the purchase of a distributor s business resulted in a million payment in payments related to business acquisitions in totaled million and are additional cash consideration paid for a business acquisition as a result of a purchase price adjustment

during  we entered into an amended and restated million senior credit agreement the amended and restated senior credit agreement 
the amended and restated senior credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of december  our available borrowings on the revolving credit facility at december  were million with approximately million of the facility set aside for outstanding letters of credit 
there were million in borrowings outstanding on the term loan at december  the proceeds of the term loan portion of the amended and restated senior credit agreement were used to repay borrowings outstanding on the term loan and revolving credit facility of million under the previously existing senior credit agreement 
in connection with the refinancing  we recorded a million loss on early extinguishment of debt of which million related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs under the previously existing senior credit agreement and million related to financing costs associated with the amended and restated senior credit agreement 
the scheduled principal payments on the term loan portion of the senior credit agreement are million annually through december  increasing to million in with the remaining balance outstanding due and payable on april  we may also be required  under certain circumstances  to make additional principal payments based on excess cash flow as defined in the senior credit agreement 
interest rates on the term loan portion of the senior credit agreement are at libor plus at december  or an alternative base rate  interest rates on the revolving credit facility portion of the senior credit agreement are at libor plus or an alternative base rate 
for those borrowings where the company elects to use the alternative base rate  the base rate will be the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate in effect on such date plus  plus a margin of for term loan borrowings or for borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the senior credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property and assets  except for our accounts receivable and related rights which are pledged in connection with our accounts receivable sales agreement 
the senior credit agreement contains covenants and restrictions which  among other things  require the maintenance of certain financial ratios  and restrict dividend payments and the incurrence of certain indebtedness and other activities  including acquisitions and dispositions 
we were in full compliance with these covenants and restrictions as of december  we are also required  under certain circumstances  to make mandatory prepayments from net cash proceeds from any issue of equity and asset sales 
mortgage notes outstanding in connection with the property and facilities utilized by our conmed linvatec subsidiary consist of a note bearing interest at per annum with semiannual payments of principal and interest through june the class a note  and a note bearing interest at per annum compounded semiannually through june  after which semiannual payments of principal and interest will commence  continuing through june the class c note 
the principal balances outstanding on the class a note and class c note aggregated million and million  respectively  at december  these mortgage notes are secured by the conmed linvatec property and facilities 

table of contents we have outstanding million in convertible senior subordinated notes the notes due the notes represent subordinated unsecured obligations and are convertible under certain circumstances  as defined in the bond indenture  into a combination of cash and conmed common stock 
upon conversion  the holder of each note will receive the conversion value of the note payable in cash up to the principal amount of the note and conmed common stock for the note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount 
amounts in excess of the principal amount are at an initial conversion rate  subject to adjustment  of shares per  principal amount of the note which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
as of december   there was no value assigned to the conversion feature because the company s share price was below the conversion price 
the notes mature on november  and are not redeemable by us prior to november  holders of the notes will be able to require that we repurchase some or all of the notes on november   and the notes contain two embedded derivatives 
the embedded derivatives are recorded at fair value in other long term liabilities and changes in their value are recorded through the consolidated statements of operations 
the embedded derivatives have a nominal value  and it is our belief that any change in their fair value would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million of our common stock in any calendar year 
we did not repurchase any shares during in the past  we have financed the repurchases and may finance additional repurchases through the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans  from operating cash flow and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
management believes that cash flow from operations  including accounts receivable sales  cash and cash equivalents on hand and available borrowing capacity under our senior credit agreement will be adequate to meet our anticipated operating working capital requirements  debt service  funding of capital expenditures and common stock repurchases in the foreseeable future

off balance sheet arrangements we have an accounts receivable sales agreement pursuant to which we and certain of our subsidiaries sell on an ongoing basis certain accounts receivable to conmed receivables corporation crc  a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose subsidiary of conmed corporation 
crc may in turn sell up to an aggregate million undivided percentage ownership interest in such receivables the asset interest to a bank the purchaser 
the purchaser s share of collections on accounts receivable are calculated as defined in the accounts receivable sales agreement  as amended 
effectively  collections on the pool of receivables flow first to the purchaser and then to crc  but to the extent that the purchaser s share of collections may be less than the amount of the purchaser s asset interest  there is no recourse to conmed or crc for such shortfall 
for receivables which have been sold  conmed corporation and its subsidiaries retain collection and administrative responsibilities as agent for the purchaser 
as of december  and  the undivided percentage ownership interest in receivables sold by crc to the purchaser aggregated million and million  respectively  which has been accounted for as a sale and reflected in the balance sheet as a reduction in accounts receivable 
expenses associated with the sale of accounts receivable  including the purchaser s financing costs to purchase the accounts receivable  were million  million and million  in  and  respectively  and are included in interest expense 

table of contents there are certain statistical ratios  primarily related to sales dilution and losses on accounts receivable  which must be calculated and maintained on the pool of receivables in order to continue selling to the purchaser 
the pool of receivables is in full compliance with these ratios 
management believes that additional accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business will be of sufficient quality and quantity to meet the requirements for sale under the accounts receivables sales agreement 
in the event that new accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business do not qualify for sale  then collections on sold receivables will flow to the purchaser rather than being used to fund new receivable purchases 
to the extent that such collections would not be available to conmed in the form of new receivables purchases  we would need to access an alternate source of working capital  such as our million revolving credit facility 
our accounts receivable sales agreement  as amended  also requires us to obtain a commitment the purchaser commitment from the purchaser to fund the purchase of our accounts receivable 
the purchaser commitment was amended effective december  whereby it was extended through october  under substantially the same terms and conditions 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter amounts in thousands 
purchase obligations represent purchase orders for goods and services placed in the ordinary course of business 
there were no capital lease obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt purchase obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations in addition to the above contractual obligations  we are required to make periodic interest payments on our long term debt obligations  see additional discussion under item a

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and as necessary through the use of derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk a significant portion of our operations consist of sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the markets in which we distribute products 
as of december   we had entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to exchange canadian dollars for united states dollars to hedge our intercompany exposure related to our canadian subsidiary 
these forward contracts settle each month at month end  at which time we enter into new forward contracts 
we have not designated these forward contracts as hedges and have not entered into any other foreign exchange forward or option contracts 
we have mitigated the effect of foreign currency exchange rate risk by transacting a significant portion of our foreign sales in united states dollars 
during  changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by approximately million and income loss before income taxes by approximately million 
in the future  we will continue to evaluate our foreign currency exposure and assess the need to enter into derivative contracts which hedge foreign currency transactions 

table of contents interest rate risk at december   we had approximately million of variable rate long term debt outstanding under our senior credit agreement and an additional million in accounts receivable sold under our accounts receivable sales agreement  we are not a party to any interest rate swap agreements as of december  assuming no repayments other than our scheduled term loan payments  if market interest rates for similar borrowings and accounts receivable sales averaged more in than they did in  interest expense would increase  and income loss before income taxes would decrease by million 
comparatively  if market interest rates for similar borrowings average less in than they did in  our interest expense would decrease  and income loss before income taxes would increase by million
