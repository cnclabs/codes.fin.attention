item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
results of operations overview we provide services to our customers and returns for our unitholders primarily through the following activities interstate pipeline transportation and storage of crude oil and liquid petroleum  gathering  treating  processing and transportation of natural gas and ngls through pipelines and related facilities  and supply  transportation and sales services  including purchasing and selling of natural gas and ngls 
we conduct our business through three business segments liquids  natural gas and marketing 
these segments are strategic business units established by senior management to facilitate the achievement of our long term objectives  to aid in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance 
the following table reflects our operating income by business segment and corporate charges for each of the years ended december in millions operating income liquids natural gas marketing corporate  operating and administrative total operating income interest expense other income income taxes income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income several types of arrangements in our natural gas and marketing segments expose us to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices where we receive natural gas or ngls in return for the services we provide  or where we purchase natural gas or ngls 
we employ derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to natural gas and ngl prices 
some of these derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 which can create volatility in our earnings that can be significant 
however  these fluctuations in earnings do not affect our cash flow 
cash flow is only affected when we settle the derivative financial instrument 
summary analysis of operating results liquids our liquids segment includes the operations of our lakehead  north dakota and mid continent systems 
each of these systems largely consists of ferc regulated interstate crude oil and liquid petroleum pipelines 
the lakehead system  together with the enbridge system in canada  forms the longest liquid petroleum pipeline system in the world 
each of these systems generates most of its revenues by charging shippers a per barrel tariff rate to transport and store crude oil and liquid petroleum 
our liquids segment contributed operating income of million in  or million more than the million contributed in the operating income of our liquids segment in was affected by the following factors modestly higher volumes on our lakehead system derived from increased production of western canadian crude oil  partially offset by higher power costs associated with the increased volumes  the annual index rate increase effective july   which increased our average tariffs  contract storage fees generated by the additional tankage added to our cushing terminal  and additional workforce related costs  pipeline integrity and casualty losses  partially offset by a reduction in field inventory expenses 
natural gas our natural gas segment consists of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines  including three ferc regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipelines  as well as natural gas treating and processing plants and related facilities 
the revenues of our natural gas segment are derived from the fees we charge to gather and process natural gas and the rates we charge to transport natural gas on our pipelines 
operating income from our natural gas segment declined to million in from million in  a decrease of million 
the operating results of our natural gas segment are attributable to the following unrealized non cash  mark to market net losses of million  resulting from our derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 increased natural gas treating and processing capacity from the completion of new facilities on our east texas and anadarko systems  coupled with increased revenue less cost of natural gas derived from our processing assets resulting from a favorable pricing environment  higher average daily volumes on our major natural gas systems during as compared with the same period in  resulting from our continuing investments to expand the capacity of our three largest natural gas systems  operational inefficiencies at our zybach processing facility in early caused by fouling of the plant with contaminated water in the natural gas stream which reduced ngl production and increased operating costs  an increase in natural gas measurement losses on two of our major gathering systems in early  and additional operating and administrative costs and depreciation associated with the expansion of our natural gas systems 
marketing our marketing segment provides supply  transmission  storage and sales services to producers and wholesale customers on our gathering  transmission and customer pipelines  as well as other interconnected pipeline systems 
our marketing activities are primarily undertaken to realize incremental revenue on gas purchased at the wellhead  increase pipeline utilization and provide other services that are valued by our customers 
operating income from our marketing segment decreased million to million in from million for the comparable period in the change in operating income of our marketing segment from to resulted from the following unrealized  non cash mark to market net losses for of million compared with non cash mark to market net gains of million for  resulting from the change in market value of our derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting  gains from the sale of natural gas inventory of approximately million  including approximately million of gains from the settlement of derivative financial instruments hedging our natural gas inventory  non cash charges of million in  resulting from a reduction of the cost basis of our natural gas inventory to market value  which is million less than the million we recorded in  and increased access to preferred natural gas markets associated with our natural gas system expansions and other initiatives 
derivative transactions and hedging activities we record all financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair market value pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
for those derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting  we record all changes in fair market value through our consolidated statements of income each period 
the fair market value of our derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or receive to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date  although that is not our intent 
rising ngl prices coupled with relatively stable natural gas prices produced million of unrealized  non cash mark to market net losses from hedges of our optional ngl production during the year ended december  we also incurred million of unrealized  non cash mark to market losses during in connection with interest rate swaps that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
during the fiscal year ended december   declining natural gas prices produced non cash mark to market net gains of million and positively affected our operating results 
mark to market gains or losses create volatility in our operating results although the derivative financial instruments we have in place do not affect our cash flow until they are settled 
we expect these non cash gains and losses to reverse in future periods as we settle the derivative financial instruments against the underlying physical transactions 
we intend to continue using derivative financial instruments to hedge our portfolio of natural gas and ngls because of the economic benefit we derive from minimizing the volatility in our cash flows 
our continued use of derivative financial instruments may result in additional unrealized  non cash gains or losses in the future 
the following table presents the unrealized gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of our derivatives  which are recorded as an element of cost of natural gas or in interest expense in our consolidated statements of income and disclosed as a reconciling item on our consolidated statements of cash flows year ended december  derivative fair value gains losses in millions natural gas segment hedge ineffectiveness non qualified hedges marketing non qualified hedges discontinued hedges commodity derivative fair value gains losses corporate non qualified interest rate hedges derivative fair value gains losses de designation and settlement of derivatives in connection with the sale of assets in december  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report  we settled for cash of approximately million  natural gas collars representing derivative financial instruments on sales of  mmbtu d of natural gas through we had previously recorded unrealized losses associated with the natural gas collars that were realized upon settlement 
additionally  we de designated derivative financial instruments that qualified for and were designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted sales of bpd of ngls through and contemporaneously closed out the position by entering into an offsetting derivative financial instrument  at market  on forecasted purchases of bpd of ngls through results of operations by segment liquids our liquids segment includes the operations of our lakehead  north dakota  and mid continent systems 
we provide a detailed description of each of these systems in item business 
the following tables set forth the operating results and statistics of our liquids segment for the periods presented year ended december  dollars in millions operating results operating revenues operating and administrative power depreciation and amortization operating expenses operating income operating statistics lakehead system united states    province of ontario total deliveries    barrel miles billions average haul miles mid continent system deliveries north dakota system trunkline gathering north dakota system deliveries total liquids segment delivery volumes   average barrels per day in thousands 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our liquids segment accounted for million of operating income in  representing an increase of million over the favorable results of our liquids business reflect modest growth in our transportation volumes while actively managing the costs of our services 
the majority of this increase related to improved results on our lakehead system 
operating revenue for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million for the same period in the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the higher delivery volumes on our lakehead and north dakota systems combined with the increase in average tariffs associated with the annual index rate increase that went into effect july   for all three of our liquids systems 
we increased the transportation rates on our lakehead system by an average of percent and on our ozark and north dakota systems by an average of percent 
additionally  new tariffs went into effect april   on our lakehead system to reflect the annual calculation of the sep ii and other surcharges based on true ups of prior year amounts and estimates for  as well as an adjustment for the terrace surcharge due to lower than expected volumes moving on the lakehead system in the tariff increases of our liquids systems contributed approximately million to the increase in our revenues for the year ended december  also contributing to the increase in revenues for the year ended december   was a million increase in contract storage fees generated by our mid continent storage terminal system from the additional storage tanks we placed in service during and in late across our mid continent system  we added a net of seven storage tanks during contributing an additional million barrels of capacity bringing the total storage capacity to approximately million barrels and tanks 
this additional storage capacity is expected to provide ongoing fixed  variable  and spot storage revenue 
average delivery volumes on our liquids systems increased to million bpd for the year ended december   from the million bpd during the same period in  accounting for approximately million of the increase in the operating revenues of our liquids segment 
the increase in average deliveries on our liquids systems are primarily derived from modest production increases of western canadian crude oil delivered on our lakehead system 
the increase in deliveries is attributable to the following crude oil supplies increased from upstream production facilities associated with the ongoing development of the alberta oil sands by producers  our mid continent system continues to operate near capacity  and volume growth on our north dakota system associated with completion of our hydrostatic testing program and phasing in portions of a system expansion that was completed in the fourth quarter of operating and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or million greater than the million for the same period in the increase in these costs is primarily attributable to the following additional workforce related costs associated with the operational  administrative  regulatory and compliance support necessary for our growing systems  further costs we incurred in connection with our pipeline integrity program  and property damage we sustained in connection with a crude oil release and fire on line of our lakehead system 
our general partner charges us the costs associated with employees and related benefits for personnel that are assigned to us or otherwise provide us with managerial and administrative services 
the portion of compensation and related costs we are charged is dependent upon such items as estimated time spent  miles of pipe and headcount 
we have experienced an increase in workforce related costs as a result of the growth and expansion of our liquids system operations 
we expect these costs will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to expand our liquids system operations 
the increase in operating and administrative costs is partially offset by a reduction for field inventory expenses we realized in that we did not incur in our pipeline systems consist of individual pipelines of varying ages from approximately years to newly constructed 
with appropriate inspection and maintenance the physical life of a pipeline is indefinitely long 
however  as our pipelines age we anticipate that the level of expenditures required for inspection  renewal and maintenance will increase 
in addition  we have established temporary pressure restrictions on some sections of some of our pipelines pending completion of specific inspection and renewal programs  and may from time to time establish further temporary pressure restrictions 
pressure restrictions reduce the available capacity of the applicable line segment and could result in a loss of throughput if and when the full capacity of that line segment would otherwise have been utilized 
the loss of throughput to date  resulting from pressure restrictions  has not materially affected our operating results 
oil measurement adjustments occur as part of the normal operations associated with our liquids systems 
the three types of oil measurement adjustments that normally occur on our systems include physical gains and losses  which result from evaporation  shrinkage  differences in measurement between receipt and delivery locations and other operational incidents  degradation  which results from mixing at the interface between higher quality light crude oil and lower quality heavy crude oil  and revaluation  which is a function of crude oil prices  the level of the carrier s inventory and the inventory positions of customers 
we identified operating conditions in on a connected third party facility that contributed to higher levels of physical losses 
we have addressed the operating conditions causing these higher levels of physical losses  which have subsequently reduced the physical losses we have experienced on our lakehead system 
we are seeking to recover damages for the losses we sustained from the owner of the third party system  but can make no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts 
power costs increased million in  compared with  predominantly due to the higher utility rates we are charged by our power suppliers 
the increase in delivery volumes is also a factor contributing to the additional power costs 
we have experienced a trend of increasing electricity rates from our power suppliers due to higher natural gas costs 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our liquids segment accounted for million of operating income in  representing an increase of million over the favorable results of the liquids segment assets reflect continuing growth in our transportation volumes while actively managing the costs of our services 
the majority of this increase related to significantly improved results on our lakehead system 
operating revenue in increased by million to million  compared with million in as indicated in the table above  total delivery volumes of our liquids segment averaged million bpd in  representing a million bpd increase from the million bpd delivered in this accounted for an increase in operating revenues of approximately million 
the increases in deliveries on our liquids systems are primarily derived from increased production of western canadian crude oil delivered on our lakehead system 
the increases in deliveries are attributable to the following suncor  an oil sands producer in alberta  canada  experienced a fire at its upgrader site in january  which affected production for the majority of in late september  suncor completed repairs and an expansion to its upgrader site 
suncor s production levels have increased since that time 
conventional light  heavy crude oil and bitumen production have increased as existing and new facilities were commissioned during syncrude  another oil sands producer in alberta completed its stage expansion and initiated production on its coker unit in may enabling all stage units to be brought on line 
start up issues were encountered and the full impact of this expansion was not realized until the stage expansion is designed to increase productive capacity from  bpd to an average  bpd of a light synthetic crude oil 
our deliveries in were marginally higher as a result of syncrude s completion and start up of its stage expansion 
contributing to the revenue growth of our liquids segment are the increases in the average tariffs on all three of our liquids systems 
these tariff increases were partly the result of the annual index rate increase allowed by the ferc 
on our lakehead system  we increased our rates by an average of three percent 
also on our lakehead system  new tariffs went into effect on april  for an adjustment on the terrace expansion program surcharge due to lower than expected volumes moving on the lakehead system  and new facilities in service  that were not operating during these tariff increases  along with the four percent increase in average hauls from miles in compared with in resulted in a combined increase in operating revenue of approximately million 
continuing volume growth related to our mid continent storage terminal system in cushing  oklahoma  and el dorado  kansas  has resulted in an increase in operating revenue of approximately million compared with net capacity additions in bring the total storage capacity to tanks and approximately million barrels 
this additional storage capacity is expected to provide ongoing fixed  variable  and spot storage revenue 
operating and administrative expenses for were million  or million less than in  primarily as a result of decreased oil measurement losses which are partially offset by increased workforce related costs and materials  supplies  and other general costs 
workforce related costs increased due to the additional resources and related benefit costs we are charged for the operational  administrative  regulatory and compliance support necessary for our growing systems as discussed above in the year end analysis for december  materials  supplies and other expenses coupled with repair and maintenance costs were higher in compared with due to higher pipeline inspection costs associated with our pipeline integrity management programs  increased outside contractor services  field inventory adjustments and other general costs 
during the fourth quarter of  we identified certain operating conditions on connected third party systems that were contributing to higher levels of physical oil losses on our lakehead system 
improvements to our oil measurement processes have resulted in fewer physical losses during on our lakehead and mid continent systems 
we expect these improvements to have a continuing positive impact on our oil measurement losses going forward 
power costs increased million in  compared with  primarily due to the increase in volumes transported on our lakehead system and higher electricity rates we are charged by our power suppliers 
we have experienced a trend of increasing electricity rates from our power suppliers due to higher natural gas and other fuel costs 
we completed a depreciation study of the lakehead system in the first quarter of that resulted in extending the composite remaining service life of the system assets from to years 
the impact of the depreciation study was an million reduction of depreciation expense for the full year of future prospects for liquids historically  western canada has been a key source of oil supply serving us energy needs 
canada s oil sands  one of the largest oil reserves in the world  are becoming an increasingly prominent source of supply 
combined conventional and oil sands established reserves of approximately billion barrels compare with saudi arabia s proved reserves of approximately billion barrels 
the national energy board of canada  or neb  estimates that total western canadian sedimentary basin  or wcsb  production averaged approximately million bpd compared with million bpd in according to production forecasts by capp  western canadian crude oil production is projected to grow progressively from approximately million bpd in to million bpd by conventional crude oil production is expected to decline from approximately million bpd to approximately  bpd over the same period 
the net increased production is expected to result from an estimated billion cad of active or planned projects that are being developed in the oil sands 
the projected growth in western canadian crude production will require construction of new pipelines to ensure new oil supplies can be transported to markets in the united states 
we and enbridge are actively working with our customers to develop transportation options that will allow canadian crude oil greater access to markets in the united states 
partnership projects southern access in conjunction with enbridge  we continue to progress on schedule with construction of the  bpd southern access expansion project 
we are undertaking the united states portion of the expansion on our lakehead system 
the first stage of construction will add approximately  bpd of capacity and is on schedule for completion by the end of the first quarter of this stage of the project includes a new pipeline between superior and delavan  wisconsin  along with pump station enhancements upstream and downstream of this segment 
the second stage of the expansion project will provide additional upstream pumping capacity and a new pipeline from delavan to flanagan  illinois  with completion expected by the end of the first quarter of completion of the total southern access expansion project will create a mile pipeline with approximately  bpd of incremental capacity on our lakehead system 
as a result of the escalation of costs we have experienced with the first stage of the project for labor  materials and rights of way  we have revised our estimated cost to complete the project 
we anticipate the ultimate cost to complete our portion of this project will approximate billion 
the impact on the project rate of return resulting from the escalation of costs is largely mitigated by the cost of service tolling arrangement used for this project 
approximately percent of the cost overage will be included in the rate base  which forms the basis for determining our tariff rates for transportation 
the remaining percent of the project cost relates to installing larger pipe than required under current agreements which we are financing in anticipation of future expansion opportunities 
alberta clipper the alberta clipper project involves construction of a new inch diameter   mile heavy crude oil pipeline from hardisty  alberta to superior  generally within or adjacent to our and enbridge s existing rights of way 
we will construct approximately miles of the new pipeline from the international border near neche  north dakota to superior and  at the request of our customers  we have revised the scope to also include a delivery connection at clearbrook  minnesota and an additional tank at superior 
alberta clipper will have an initial capacity of  bpd and allows for expansions up to  bpd by adding pump stations 
in addition  complementary capacity on the southern access inch pipeline from superior to flanagan will be obtained by installing additional pump stations 
we anticipate that our share of the construction cost for the united states segment of the project will approximate billion  in dollars  excluding capitalized interest 
alberta clipper will be a common carrier line fully integrated with the enbridge lakehead mainline systems for tolling purposes 
in may  enbridge filed an application with the neb  for the construction and operation of the canadian segment of the project 
in june  enbridge filed supplements to this application setting forth the tolling principles for the canadian portion of the project  which are supported by capp 
hearings for the canadian section of the project began in november regulatory and permit applications are in progress at state and federal levels 
we plan to file a set of toll principles with the ferc similar to those filed by enbridge with the neb for the canadian segment of the project 
the project remains subject to regulatory approvals and receipt of various permits in canada and the united states 
enbridge is progressing with land access  engineering and initial procurement commitments to facilitate commencement of project construction 
alberta clipper is expected to be in service in mid north dakota we substantially completed our expansion of the north dakota system during the fourth quarter of the expansion added approximately  bpd of mainline throughput capacity and expanded the system s feeder segment by approximately  bpd at an approximate cost of million 
the expansion is supported by increasing crude oil production from the bakken formation in the williston basin region of montana and north dakota 
regional producers in the williston basin areas of montana and north dakota have expressed interest in further expansion of pipeline capacity on our north dakota system 
we have proposed an approximate billion additional expansion that will consist of upgrades to existing pump stations  additional tankage  as well as extensive use of drag reducing agents dra that are injected into the pipeline 
this second expansion of our north dakota system is expected to increase system capacity to  bpd from the  bpd that is currently available 
the commercial structure for this expansion is a cost of service based surcharge that will be added to the existing tariff rates 
the proposed surcharge is similar to the structure being used on the recently completed expansion project and is subject to approval from the ferc 
superior and griffith storage due to forecasted production increases of synthetic heavy crude oil that we anticipate will be transported on the enbridge lakehead mainline systems from western canada to chicago  we are constructing additional crude oil storage tanks at superior and griffith to accommodate the anticipated volumes 
we completed construction and placed into service one tank with approximately  barrels of operational capacity at superior in august and another tank at griffith with approximately  barrels of operational capacity in december we are also building two tanks with operational capacity of approximately  barrels each that are scheduled to be completed during mid continent terminal storage we continue to experience strong interest from customers in securing access to long term contract storage capacity at our cushing  oklahoma terminal 
during  we obtained commitments and initiated construction of an additional million barrels of storage tanks  million barrels of which were completed in late december during  we completed construction of additional storage tanks with approximately million barrels of capacity 
our total mid continent terminal capacity is approximately million barrels  which includes million barrels of operational storage 
enbridge and other projects spearhead pipeline in another effort to provide shippers access to new markets  enbridge acquired a pipeline that runs from cushing to chicago  illinois 
the reversed pipeline  renamed spearhead  began delivering canadian crude oil to the major oil hub at cushing in march and has operated at or near its capacity of  bpd 
in the first half of  enbridge successfully concluded a binding open season for expansion of the pipeline to  bpd  with binding commitments for capacity of  bpd 
in december  the ferc issued a favorable declaratory order effectively approving the tolling methodology and priority service for shippers with binding commitments 
the spearhead pipeline is complementary to our lakehead system as western canadian crude oil is carried on our lakehead system as far as chicago  and then transferred to the spearhead pipeline 
the spearhead pipeline expansion is expected to be in service in early southern access extension in july  enbridge announced that it received support from shippers and capp for its inch diameter southern access extension pipeline from flanagan  illinois to patoka  illinois 
the extension will broaden the reach of the enbridge lakehead mainline system to incremental markets accessible from the patoka hub 
the project is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of this project is being undertaken by enbridge  however  we will benefit from the incremental volumes moving through our lakehead system to reach this extension 
enbridge filed a petition for declaratory order with the ferc in october  which is currently pending approval 
southern lights following completion of a successful open season in  enbridge initiated its southern lights project to construct a diluent pipeline from chicago  illinois to edmonton  alberta  canada to meet the growing demand for crude oil diluent required to transport the heavy oil and bitumen a thick  tar like form of oil being produced in increasing volumes from the alberta oil sands 
the project involves the exchange of a mile section of pipeline we own for a similar section of a new pipeline to be constructed as part of the project 
in addition  this project involves a reconfiguration of our light crude mainline system which will provide an additional  bpd of effective capacity at no cost to us 
we expect to benefit from increased heavy crude oil shipments  which will be facilitated by the diluent line 
enbridge has filed applications with the neb for approval of all facets of the canadian portion of the project and the majority of necessary applications for the united states portion of the project with united states federal and state regulatory agencies 
enbridge filed a petition for declaratory order with the ferc setting forth the rate structure for establishing tolls and the proposed swap of line discussed above  which the ferc approved in late december in conjunction with our southern access project  the southern lights project has been allowed the right to exercise eminent domain for right of way in illinois 
early construction and right of way acquisition related to this project continues in tandem with stage one of the southern access project 
this project is expected to be placed in service in texas access pipeline non binding expressions of interests received in june demonstrated strong shipper support for the construction of a new heavy crude oil pipeline system to transport crude oil from patoka  illinois to the us gulf coast 
enbridge us inc and exxonmobil pipeline company are jointly pursuing development of the texas access pipeline  which as proposed will provide approximately  bpd of new capacity from patoka  illinois to texas gulf coast refineries with a projected in service date of mid the proposed project comprises a new mile  inch diameter pipeline that begins in the vicinity of mobil pipe line company s patoka  illinois crude oil terminal southward to nederland  texas  coupled with an mile  inch lateral to transport crude oil onward from nederland to a delivery point in houston  texas 
the new pipeline will allow for connectivity to existing terminals in both nederland and houston  and will be constructed in the same corridor with existing pipelines owned by exxonmobil pipeline company 
the initial capacity of the patoka to nederland segment of the pipeline would be  bpd  and the initial capacity of the nederland to houston segment would be  bpd 
in december  an open season was announced to solicit binding year shipper commitments for the proposed texas access pipeline  which ends on march  construction of this project would complement our lakehead system and further support its expansion 
eastern padd ii access enbridge has held discussions with several refiners in the eastern united states to gauge interest in supporting the development of a pipeline to provide incremental pipeline capacity to this market 
development of this project is ongoing and is expected to provide up to approximately  bpd of heavy canadian crude oil to the eastern padd ii market by late additional access initiative discussions have commenced with other area refiners to provide incremental infrastructure in this area for service in the timeframe 
construction of both of these projects would be complementary to our lakehead system 
other matters in september  the alberta royalty review panel issued its recommendations to the government of the province of alberta calling for the adoption of measures to increase the alberta government s share of revenues from oil sands development 
a majority of the recommendations of the report were subsequently adopted by the alberta government and will become effective january  these measures may impact how oil sands developers evaluate future projects and this may reduce the level of future volumes we expect to flow through the enbridge lakehead mainline system 
natural gas our natural gas segment consists of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines  as well as treating and processing plants and related facilities 
collectively  these systems include approximately  miles of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines including three ferc regulated transmission pipeline systems  natural gas treating plants  natural gas processing plants including three recently installed hydrocarbon dewpoint control facilities  and trucks  trailers and railcars used for transporting ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide 
the following tables set forth the operating results of our natural gas segment assets and average daily volumes of our major systems in mmbtu d for the periods presented year ended december  dollars in millions operating revenues    cost of natural gas    operating and administrative depreciation and amortization gain on sale of assets expenses    operating income east texas    anadarko    north texas    utos    midla    alatenn    bamagas    other major intrastates    total    in november  we sold the kpc system which contributed average daily volumes of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and in december  we sold the south texas assets and a sour gas system in east texas which had a combined average daily volume of approximately  mmbtu d  of this amount  mmbtu d relates to south texas 
we have included in other major intrastates the volumes of our gloria system for the years ended december    and of   and  we recognize revenue upon delivery of natural gas and ngls to customers  when services are rendered  pricing is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we derive revenue in our natural gas segment from the following types of arrangements fee based arrangements under a fee based contract  we receive a set fee for gathering  treating  processing and transporting raw natural gas and providing other similar services 
these revenues correspond with the volumes and types of services provided and do not depend directly on commodity prices 
revenues of the natural gas segment that are derived from transmission services consist of reservation fees charged for transmission of natural gas on the ferc regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline systems  while revenues from intrastate pipelines are generally derived from the bundled sales of natural gas and transmission services 
other arrangements we also use other types of arrangements to derive revenues for our natural gas segment 
these arrangements expose us to commodity price risk  which we substantially mitigate with offsetting physical purchases and sales and by the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge open positions 
we will continue to hedge a significant amount of our commodity price risk to support the stability of our cash flows 
refer to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk and note of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report for more information about the derivative activities we use to mitigate this commodity price risk 
these other types of arrangements are categorized as follows percentage of liquids contracts under these contracts  we receive a negotiated percentage of ngls and condensate extracted from natural gas that requires processing  which we then sell at market prices and retain as our fee 
this contract structure is similar to percentage of proceeds arrangements except that we only receive a percentage of the ngls and condensate 
keep whole contracts under these contracts  we gather or purchase raw natural gas from the producer for processing 
a portion of the gathered or purchased natural gas is consumed during processing 
we extract and retain the ngls produced during processing for our own account  which we sell at market prices 
in instances where we purchase raw gas at the wellhead  we also sell for our own account at market prices  the resulting residue gas 
in those instances when we gather and process raw natural gas for the account of the producer  we must return to the producer residue gas with an energy content equivalent to the original raw natural gas we received as measured in british thermal units  or btu 
percentage of index contracts under these contracts  we purchase raw natural gas at a negotiated discount to an agreed upon index price 
we then resell the natural gas  generally for the index price  keeping the difference as our fee 
percentage of proceeds contracts under these contracts  we receive a negotiated percentage of the natural gas and ngls we process in the form of residue natural gas  ngls  condensate and sulfur  which we then sell at market prices and retain as our fee 
under the terms of each of these contract structures  we retain a portion of the natural gas and ngls as our fee in exchange for providing these producers with our services 
in order to protect our cash flows from volatility that can result from fluctuations in commodity prices  we enter into derivative financial instruments to effectively fix the sales price of the natural gas and ngls we anticipate receiving under the terms of these contracts 
we target approximately to percent hedge coverage of our anticipated near term exposure to commodity prices using derivative financial instruments 
as a result of entering into these derivative financial instruments  we have largely fixed the amount of cash that we will receive in the future when we sell the processed natural gas and ngls  although the market price of these commodities will continue to fluctuate during that time 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our natural gas segment produced million of operating income for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the million of operating income generated during the prior year 
operating income in included unrealized  non cash mark to market net losses from our derivative activities totaling million which are million more than the million of net losses we recorded in the same period of also contributing to operating income were volume increases  improved pricing for our services and greater processing margins  which represent revenues less the cost of natural gas purchased for processing 
partially offsetting these increases in operating income were higher operating costs and depreciation 
the operating income of our natural gas segment for the year ended december  was negatively affected by unrealized non cash  mark to market net losses of million from our derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
these losses were predominantly the result of hedges placed on the optional processing we perform on our three major systems which do not qualify for hedge accounting 
in  our operating income was reduced by unrealized non cash  mark to market net losses of million  including million of losses that resulted from ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges and million of gains derived from our derivative financial instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
refer also to item a

average daily volumes on our major natural gas systems increased percent  or approximately  mmbtu d  for the year ended december   compared with the corresponding period of the increased volumes for continue to reflect our ongoing investments to further expand the capacity of our systems and services 
we completed the following projects during and which have contributed to the increases in average daily volumes and operating results of our major natural gas systems construction of our henderson natural gas processing facility on our east texas system was completed and operating at the end of the third quarter of with a capacity of mmcf d  a link between our north texas and east texas systems became fully operational during the third quarter of  increasing the utilization of our mmcf d east texas intrastate pipeline that we placed in service in june  various segments of our east texas expansion and extension project project clarity including the following a inch diameter pipeline that runs from the marquez treating facility to crockett  texas and the inch diameter pipeline that runs from crockett to goodrich  texas were both completed and placed into service in late march  the marquez treating plant with capacity of approximately mmcf d and additional pipeline capacity to the existing southeast section of this area was completed and placed into service in march a inch diameter pipeline in close proximity to our marquez treating facility was completed and placed into service in june  a inch diameter pipeline that extends from an interconnect with our existing pipeline at bethel  texas to crockett was completed and placed into service in late july  a inch diameter pipeline that extends from goodrich to kountze was completed in october  which enables deliveries into a major interstate pipeline  expansion of our existing mmcf d aker treating facility was completed in and additional expansions are underway at this facility in  construction of the hidetown processing facility on our anadarko system with approximate capacity of mmcf d was completed and placed into service at the end of april  during the second quarter of  we refurbished our zybach processing plant to address operational inefficiencies experienced by the plant 
as a result of the service and repairs  processing volumes were restored to expected levels  and construction of the weatherford gas processing facility within our north texas system was completed in september with a processing capacity of approximately mmcf d 
at the end of  additional processing capacity was added to the weatherford processing facility to increase its capacity from mmcf day to mmcf day 
in addition to the investments we have made to expand the volumes in areas served by our natural gas assets  the volume and revenue growth is also the result of additional wellhead supply contracts and robust drilling activity in the bossier trend and barnett shale areas 
we expect increasing volumes on our major natural gas systems to result from our continuing investments to expand the capacity of our systems to provide gathering  processing and transportation services to meet the needs of producers in the areas we serve 
during  we have added approximately mmcf d of additional processing capacity to our natural gas systems  which has served to increase our processing margin 
during  ngl prices continued to trend higher relative to natural gas prices  providing a favorable environment for the production of ngls from our processing assets  similar to the pricing environment experienced during a variable element of our natural gas segment s operating income is derived from the processing of natural gas under keep whole arrangements that exist within our east texas  north texas and anadarko systems 
operating income derived from our keep whole processing increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in primarily due to the current favorable pricing environment and increased volumes processed associated with these types of arrangements and increased processing plant capacity 
partially offsetting our favorable processing results were operational issues associated with our zybach processing plant that occurred during the first quarter of which reduced processing margins by approximately million 
we completed the necessary repairs and modifications during april and the plant has since been operating as expected throughout the remainder of natural gas measurement losses occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our natural gas pipelines 
the quantification and resolution of measurement losses is complicated by several factors including varying qualities of natural gas in the streams gathered and processed through our systems  changes in weather temperatures and variances in measurement that are inherent in metering technologies 
during the first quarter  we identified operating conditions on our gathering systems which contributed to an increase in measurement losses 
we have since installed separator equipment to identify and eliminate free water in the natural gas streams  one of the underlying causes for the increase in measurement losses during for the year ended december   we estimate that measurement losses resulted in approximately million of additional cost to our natural gas systems relative to the same period of a portion of our natural gas segment is exposed to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices associated with the percentage of proceeds  percentage of liquids  and percentage of index contracts that we negotiate with producers 
under the terms of these contracts  we retain a portion of the natural gas and ngls we process in exchange for providing these producers with our services 
in order to protect our unitholders from the volatility in cash flows that can result from fluctuations in commodity prices  we enter into derivative financial instruments to fix the sales price of the natural gas and ngls we anticipate receiving under the terms of these contracts 
we target approximately to percent hedge coverage of our anticipated near term exposure to commodity prices using derivative financial instruments 
as a result of entering into these derivative financial instruments  we have largely fixed the amount of cash that we will pay for natural gas and receive in the future when we sell the processed natural gas and ngls  although the market price of these commodities will continue to fluctuate during that time 
another significant portion of the revenue we receive is derived from fees charged for gathering and treating of natural gas volumes and other related services which are not directly dependent on commodity prices 
operating and administrative costs associated with our natural gas segment were million  or percent  greater for than  primarily as a result of increased workforce related cost associated with the expansion of our systems  maintenance activities and other costs that are mostly variable with volumes 
our workforce related costs increased for the year ended december  over the same period in due to the additional resources and related benefit costs we are charged for the operational  administrative  regulatory and compliance support necessary for our existing assets and the expansion of our natural gas operations 
in addition  our general partner charges us the costs associated with employees and related benefits for personnel that are assigned to us or otherwise provide us with managerial and administrative services 
the portion of compensation and related costs we are charged is dependent upon such items as estimated time spent  miles of pipe and headcount 
in addition we have experienced an increase in outside contract labor cost  given the high demand and competitive rates within our industry as a result of continuous pipeline expansions across the areas we serve 
our materials and supplies coupled with repair and maintenance costs increased for the year ended december  over the same period in  predominantly due to the increase in volumes and expansion of our natural gas systems 
materials  supplies and other costs include chemicals used in our processing activities  materials purchased for repair and maintenance purposes  utility costs to run our plants  pumps and other similar costs that are mostly variable with volumes 
repair and maintenance costs include compressor maintenance  downtime for routine and unscheduled maintenance  pipeline integrity costs and other similar items that have increased with the expansion of our existing natural gas systems 
an example of these increasing costs is methanol  a chemical used on our systems which cost per gallon in at the end of  this chemical had risen in cost to per gallon 
welders  inspectors and other skilled laborers and technicians hourly labor costs have increased in cost by amounts well in excess of the rate of overall inflation as measured by the cpi or ppi inflation index 
we expect our operating and administrative costs will continue to increase in future periods as greater volumes of natural gas flow through our systems and we continue to expand our natural gas operations 
our depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased by approximately million over the same period in  primarily as a result of capital projects completed and placed in service during late and throughout we expect our depreciation expense to continue to increase as we complete capital projects related to our continued expansion of our natural gas operations 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our natural gas segment contributed million of operating income in  an increase of million from the million it contributed in the increase in operating income is primarily attributable to favorable commodity prices which contributed to higher revenue generated by our processing assets in excess of the cost we incur for the natural gas used in processing 
additionally  operating income was higher due to volume increases on each of our three largest systems resulting from additional wellhead supply contracts and the expansion of our transportation and processing capacity 
partially offsetting the benefit provided by favorable volumes and commodity prices are expenses we recorded in of approximately million for ngl purchases and transportation and fractionation charges that relate to prior years we had not previously recorded 
our volumes and operating results are exclusive of the volumes and operating results associated with our december sale of the south texas assets and a sour gas system located on our east texas system 
average daily volumes on our major natural gas systems were up approximately percent in  compared with increases in our volumes for are attributable to our ongoing investments to expand the capacity of our systems and services 
our investments in the following projects that were completed during contributed to the increase in the average daily volumes and operating results on our major natural gas systems the link between our north texas and east texas systems became fully operational during the third quarter of  increasing the utilization of our mmcf d east texas intrastate pipeline that we placed in service in june  construction of our mmcf d henderson natural gas processing facility on our east texas system was completed at the end of the third quarter of and processed volumes of approximately mmcf d  the expansion of our existing zybach processing facility on our anadarko system to a capacity of mmcf d of natural gas from an initial capacity of mmcf d to meet the continuing demands resulting from rapid development in the anadarko basin  and acquisition of an mile pipeline in april that is complimentary to our existing east texas system that provided approximately  mmbtu d of incremental volume 
in addition to the investments we have made to expand our volumes in the areas served by our natural gas assets  the volume and revenue growth is also the result of additional wellhead supply contracts and robust drilling activity in the anadarko basin  bossier trend and barnett shale 
throughout a majority of  we have experienced a favorable pricing environment with regard to our assets and our processing 
during  ngl and crude oil prices remained high relative to natural gas prices which have declined from the high prices reached in late this increase includes the contribution to operating income derived from our keep whole processing  of million  including million from our north texas system  for the year ended december   in excess of the million generated in under this contract structure 
due to the volatility associated with commodity prices  the revenue less cost of natural gas we derive from our processing activities in future periods could be adversely affected if the pricing environment becomes unfavorable  which can occur if the prices for ngls substantially decline and the price of natural gas significantly increases 
we attempt to hedge a majority of our mandatory processing to minimize the effects volatility in commodity prices can have on our processing activities 
operating income of our natural gas segment for the year ended december  includes unrealized non cash  mark to market net losses of million  including million of losses resulting from ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges and million of gains derived from our derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
in  our operating income was reduced by million of unrealized  non cash  mark to market net losses that we incurred  primarily from derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
the decline in our unrealized derivative fair value losses in is largely due to a decline in the current and forward prices of natural gas and ngls during from the high levels reached in due to hurricanes rita and katrina that caused supply disruptions in the gulf of mexico resulting in a volatile pricing environment 
additionally  our unrealized derivative fair value losses in are lower due to our settlement in december for million of natural gas collars on  mmbtu d of natural gas through that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
the settlement of these natural gas collars reduces the quantity of derivatives outstanding that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment in our natural gas segment  effectively reducing the unrealized mark to market adjustments resulting from these derivatives in periods following settlement

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk and note of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report for more information about our derivative activities 
operating and administrative costs of our natural gas segment were million  or percent  greater for than  primarily as a result of increased workforce related costs  maintenance activities and other costs that are mostly variable with volumes 
workforce related costs have increased due to the additional resources and related benefit costs we are charged for the operational  administrative  regulatory and compliance support necessary for our existing assets and the expansion of our natural gas operations 
the increase in our materials  supplies and other costs along with our repair and maintenance costs are predominantly related to the increase in volumes and expansion of our natural gas systems 
materials  supplies and other costs include chemicals used in our processing activities  materials purchased for repair and maintenance purposes  utility costs to run our plants  pumps and other similar costs that are mostly variable with volumes 
these costs were partially offset by the sale of our south texas assets and a sour gas system located on our east texas system in december  which contributed to the decrease in materials  supplies and other costs compared with repair and maintenance costs include compressor maintenance  downtime for routine and unscheduled maintenance  pipeline integrity costs and other similar items that have increased with the expansion of our existing natural gas systems 
during  we spent approximately million  the majority of which was in the fourth quarter of  on pipeline integrity work in connection with our ongoing pipeline integrity management program in order to comply with regulatory guidance and maintain our existing pipeline integrity standards 
we anticipate these costs will continue to increase as we expand our systems and increase the volumes of natural gas services we provide 
our other operating and administrative costs include rents and leases which primarily relate to compressor rentals  property taxes and other costs 
these additional operating and administrative costs tend to vary in relation to the natural gas volumes moving on our systems or in relation to the expansion of our natural gas operations 
we anticipate these costs will continue to increase as the volumes on our systems increase and we expand our systems 
our depreciation and amortization expense for the year exceeded the amount reported for by approximately million  primarily as a result of capital projects completed and placed in service during and projects completed in that were only depreciated for a partial year 
the increase in depreciation expense was partially offset by modest extensions of the depreciable lives of our major natural gas systems based on a third party study commissioned by management that was completed in the third quarter of as a result of this study  revised depreciation rates for the anadarko  north texas and east texas systems were implemented effective august  the annual composite rate  which represents the expected remaining service life of these natural gas systems  was reduced from to 
as a result  our depreciation expense was approximately million and million lower for the years ended december  and  respectively  than if these rates had not been reduced 
additionally  we revised our depreciation rates for a portion of our ferc regulated natural gas assets effective july   to reflect a decrease in the remaining service life of these natural gas assets 
depreciation expense was approximately million higher for the year ended december   as a result of this decrease in the expected remaining service life of these assets 
future prospects for natural gas our natural gas assets are located in the gulf coast and mid continent regions of the united states  two of the premier natural gas producing areas 
as a result  there are many opportunities to connect new natural gas supplies either by installing new facilities or acquiring adjacent third party gathering operations 
consolidation with neighboring facilities will extract efficiencies by eliminating costs  for example  by combining redundant facilities  increasing volume  and increasing processing margins 
these opportunities tend to involve modest amounts of capital with attractive rates of return 
we continue to assess various expansion opportunities to pursue our strategy for growth 
while we remain committed to making accretive acquisitions in or near areas where we have a competitive advantage  we will continue to focus our efforts primarily on development of our existing pipeline systems 
we may  and have  pursued opportunities to divest any non strategic natural gas assets as conditions warrant 
results of our natural gas gathering and processing business depend upon the drilling activities of natural gas producers in the areas we serve 
during  increased drilling in the areas where our gathering systems are located contributed to the growth of volumes on our systems 
we expect the growth trend in these areas to continue in the future as evidenced by external production forecasts and the strong rig counts and permitting in the areas served by our systems 
producer plans for drilling in the areas served by our natural gas assets are expected to result in continued production growth on our natural gas systems 
to accommodate this further growth  we initiated construction on several projects to increase our gathering  processing  transportation and treating infrastructure  as well as market access capability and have completed a number of these projects as discussed above under our analysis for the remaining projects listed below continue to progress and include east texas system expansion and extension project clarity the expansion and extension of our east texas natural gas system  referred to as the clarity project  includes construction of a inch diameter intrastate pipeline from bethel  texas to orange  texas with capacity of approximately mmcf d 
pipeline construction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of additional capacity to downstream interconnects will increase as compression is added through mid the pipeline will provide service to a number of major industrial companies in southeast texas with interconnects to interstate pipelines  intrastate pipelines and wholesale customers 
we continue to secure additional commitments for capacity on the pipeline 
our expectation is that the ultimate cost to complete the construction of this project will approximate million 
other east texas projects the expansion of our sour gas treating capacity on the east texas system will increase the total sulfur capacity from tons per day tpd to tpd by early  in order to handle additional sour gas supply and higher concentration levels of hydrogen sulfide h s 
we have completed construction of three hydrocarbon dewpoint control facilities on our east texas system to add processing capacity to meet the increasingly more stringent pipeline gas quality specifications 
we completed and placed into service facilities  which we refer to as henderson ii  grapeland  and carthage hydrocarbon dewpoint control facilities 
these facilities have a cumulative capacity of mmcf d and obtain a significant portion of their revenues from fees rather than keep whole processing or percentage of liquids revenues 
in the first quarter of we completed construction of a mile  inch diameter pipeline from a lateral on our east texas system to gather additional production being developed in east texas  which we expect will be transported on the clarity system to markets in southeast texas 
north texas system projects in order to accommodate the active development and anticipated growth occurring in the barnett shale play in north texas we commenced construction of two natural gas processing plants and related upstream facilities with a combined total capacity of approximately mmcf d 
during the third quarter  we placed the mmcf d weatherford processing facility in service and completed construction on a further expansion of mmcf d in the fourth quarter of anadarko system projects we continue to increase our field compression in the anadarko region  which we expect will begin contributing to our operating results during the remainder of when fully operational  we expect that the new assets we are constructing will provide additional sources of cash flow for us 
we continue to evaluate other projects that could further integrate our major texas centered natural gas pipeline systems 
other matters a number of new interstate natural gas transportation pipelines are being constructed that may alter interstate transportation of natural gas 
these newly constructed pipelines could affect the operating results of certain of our existing market based interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines  primarily the alatenn  midla  and mlgt systems 
conversely  our supply based gathering systems may benefit from enhanced capacity out of our gathering areas 
we recently initiated negotiations with a major customer of our enbridge pipelines midla  llc  or midla  mainline transmission system for the renewal of a contract that is set to expire in august the ultimate outcome of these negotiations is uncertain 
the modest amount of operating income we derive from the midla mainline transmission system could be reduced in the event the customer terminates the contract or renews it at lower rates than we currently charge 
further  such an outcome could reduce midla s ability to recover the carrying value of its noncurrent assets  which approximate million at december  in november  we sold our kansas pipeline system  or kpc  to an unrelated party for million in cash  subject to adjustments for working capital items 
kpc is an interstate natural gas transmission system  which serves the wichita  kansas and kansas city  kansas markets and includes approximately  miles of pipeline ranging in diameter from to inches  along with three compressor stations 
kpc represents a business within our natural gas segment that we do not consider strategic to the ongoing central operations of our core natural gas segment assets 
the operating results of the kpc system were not material to our consolidated operating results or those of our natural gas segment for the years ended december   and we recognized a gain of million on the sale of kpc  which is presented in income from discontinued operations 
in december  calpine corporation calpine and many of its subsidiaries  including the subsidiary that owns the two utility plants served by our bamagas system  filed voluntarily petitions to restructure under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
since filing for bankruptcy  calpine has continued to perform under the terms of its agreements with bamagas 
in june  calpine and certain of its subsidiaries filed a joint plan of reorganization the plan and disclosure statement with the united states bankruptcy court 
on december  the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york issued a decision confirming calpine s reorganization plan 
in addition  the bamagas contracts with calpine have been reaffirmed 
calpine announced at the end of january that it has emerged from bankruptcy 
marketing the following table sets forth the operating results for the marketing segment assets for the periods presented year ended december  dollars in millions operating revenues    cost of natural gas    operating and administrative depreciation and amortization expenses    operating income loss our marketing business derives a majority of its operating income from selling natural gas received from producers on our natural gas segment pipeline assets to end users of the natural gas 
a majority of the natural gas we purchase is produced in texas markets where we previously had limited physical access to the primary interstate pipeline delivery points  or hubs  such as the houston ship channel 
as a result of the completed segments of our natural gas system expansions and other initiatives during  our marketing business now has access to several interstate natural gas pipelines  which it can use to transport natural gas to primary markets where it can be sold at more favorable prices 
prior to  physical pipeline constraints often limited the ability of our marketing business to transport the natural gas to these primary markets  which would more frequently require our marketing business to transport natural gas to alternate market points with less favorable pricing 
our marketing business is exposed to commodity price fluctuations because the natural gas purchased by our marketing business is generally priced using an index that is different from the pricing index at which the gas is sold 
this price exposure arises from the relative difference in natural gas prices between the contracted index at which the natural gas is purchased and the index under which it is sold  otherwise known as the spread 
the spread can vary significantly due to local supply and demand factors 
wherever possible  this pricing exposure is economically hedged using derivative financial instruments 
however  the structure of these economic hedges often precludes our use of hedge accounting under the requirements of sfas no 
 which can create volatility in the operating results of our marketing segment 
in addition to the market access provided by our intrastate natural gas pipelines  our marketing business also contracts for firm transportation capacity on third party interstate and intrastate pipelines to allow access to additional markets 
to offset the demand charges associated with these transportation agreements  we look for market conditions that allow us to lock in the price differential or spread between the pipeline receipt point and pipeline delivery point 
this allows our marketing business to lock in a fixed sales margin inclusive of pipeline demand charges 
we accomplish this by transacting basis swaps between the index where the natural gas is purchased and the index where the natural gas is sold 
by transacting a basis swap between those two indices  we can effectively lock in a margin on the combined natural gas purchase and the natural gas sale  mitigating the demand charges on these transportation agreements and limiting the partnership s exposure to cash flow volatility that could arise in markets where the transporting the natural gas becomes uneconomical 
however  the structure of these transactions precludes our use of hedge accounting under the requirements of sfas no 
 which can create volatility in the operating results of our marketing segment 
in addition to natural gas basis swaps  we contract for storage to assist with balancing natural gas supply and end use market sales 
in order to mitigate the absolute price differential between the cost of injected natural gas and withdrawn natural gas  as well as storage fees  the injection and withdrawal price differential  or spread  is hedged by buying fixed price swaps for the forecasted injection periods and selling fixed price swaps for the forecasted withdrawal periods 
when the injection and withdrawal spread increases or decreases in value as a result of market price movements  we can earn additional profit through the optimization of those hedges in both the forward and daily markets 
although all of these hedge strategies are sound economic hedging techniques  these types of financial transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting under the sfas no 
guidelines 
as such  the non qualified hedges are accounted for on a mark to market basis  and the periodic change in their market value  although non cash  will impact our operating results 
natural gas purchased and sold by our marketing segment is priced at a published daily or monthly price index 
sales to wholesale customers typically incorporate a premium for managing their transmission and balancing requirements 
higher premiums and associated margins result from transactions that involve smaller volumes or that offer greater service flexibility for wholesale customers 
at their request  we will enter into long term  fixed price purchase or sales contracts with our customers and generally will enter into offsetting hedged positions under the same or similar terms 
marketing pays third party storage facilities and pipelines for the right to store and transport natural gas for various periods of time 
these contracts may be denoted as firm storage  interruptible storage  or parking and lending services 
these various contract structures are used to mitigate risk associated with sales and purchase contracts  and to take advantage of price differential opportunities 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our marketing business has benefited from the increased access to preferred natural gas markets resulting from our natural gas system expansions and other initiatives 
although the operating income of our marketing segment for the year ended december  of million is million lower than the million for the year ended december   the change is primarily due to the million decrease in unrealized  non cash mark to market gains associated with our derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of unrealized mark to market losses from our derivative activities as compared with million of unrealized mark to market gains for the year ended december  the unrealized  mark to market losses for the year ended december   are the result of modest increases in the forward and daily market prices of natural gas from december  during the year ended december   declines in the forward and daily market prices of natural gas from the historically high prices existing at december  produced significant unrealized mark to market gains in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
we expect the unrealized mark to market gains and losses associated with our portfolio of derivative financial instruments to be offset when the related physical transactions are settled 
refer to the discussions included in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to our financial statements beginning on page f of this report 
the operating results of our marketing business for the year ended december  also include gains of approximately million that we realized upon the sale of natural gas inventory  including approximately million of gains from the settlement of derivative financial instruments hedging our natural gas inventory 
partially offsetting these gains are non cash charges of million that we recorded to reduce the cost basis of our natural gas inventory to fair market value  which is million less than the million non cash charges we recorded during the year ended december  the market price for natural gas in various storage locations may experience declines during the year from the prices at which the inventory was purchased 
due to our hedging structures  we expect that a majority of these charges will be offset by future financial transactions that will settle at the time the natural gas inventory is sold 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  for the year ended december   the operating income of our marketing segment increased million to million  from a loss of million in the significant increase in the operating income of our marketing segment for is primarily due to unrealized  non cash  mark to market net gains of approximately million compared with unrealized mark to market net losses of million for these unrealized mark to market changes are associated with derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
the unrealized  mark to market gains for are the result of a decline in the forward and daily market price of natural gas from the historically high prices experienced in additionally  the basis between the index where the natural gas is purchased and the index where the natural gas is sold has declined in correlation with the decline in the forward market price of natural gas contributing to the unrealized  mark to market net gains for the operating results of our marketing segment for the year ended december   also include non cash charges totaling million attributable to reducing the cost basis of our natural gas inventory to fair market value 
natural gas prices as published by platt s gas daily for henry hub were approximately per mmbtu at december   which had declined to per mmbtu at december  as a result of the decline in the price of natural gas from to  we recorded charges totaling million during to reduce the cost basis of our inventory to fair market value 
partially offsetting this charge are gains of approximately million that we realized upon settlement of derivative financial instruments hedging our natural gas inventory for due to our hedging structures  we expect that a majority of the lower of cost or market inventory charges will be offset by future financial and physical transactions that will settle at the time the natural gas inventory is sold 
corporate year ended december  compared with year ended december  interest expense was million in compared with million in the decrease is due to million of additional interest capitalized on our construction projects during the year compared with same period of  partially offset by higher average debt balances and weighted average interest rates 
capitalized interest was approximately million on our construction projects for compared with million capitalized in our weighted average interest rate was approximately for the year ended december   compared with approximately during our debt balances are higher as a result of the capital expenditures we made to expand our pipeline systems that were partially financed by additional borrowings 
we are not a taxable entity for us federal income tax purposes or for the majority of states that impose an income tax 
our income tax expense of million for the year ended december  results from the enactment  by the state of texas  of a new state tax computed on our modified gross margin 
no comparable tax existed during the year ended december  we determined this tax to be an income tax under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

we computed our income tax expense for the year ended december  by applying a apportioned state income tax rate to taxable margin  as defined in state of texas statutes 
our income tax expense represents a effective rate as applied to pretax book income 
in july  the state of michigan enacted substantial changes to its tax structure that become effective in the new system is comprised of two parts  a modified gross receipts tax at and a tax on income that will be levied on our michigan operating activities 
we determined that these taxes are income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
our initial accounting for the enactment of this income tax did not materially affect our results of operation  financial position  or cash flows 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  interest expense was million in compared with million in the increase is the result of higher debt balances and weighted average interest rates  partially offset by approximately million of interest capitalized on our construction projects for compared with million capitalized in our weighted average interest rate was approximately for the year ended december   compared with approximately during our debt balances are higher at december  compared with december  as a result of the capital expenditures we have made to expand our existing systems to improve the service capabilities of our assets 
included in other income for the year ended december   is approximately million that we received as settlement for an insurance claim that we filed in connection with an interruption to the operations of our lakehead system resulting from a fire that occurred at suncor s upgrader site in january liquidity and capital resources general we believe that our ability to generate cash flow  in addition to our access to capital  is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future operating and investment needs 
our primary cash requirements consist of normal operating expenses  capital expenditures for our expansion projects  enhancement and maintenance capital expenditures  debt service payments  distributions to our partners  acquisitions of new assets and businesses  and payments associated with our derivative transactions 
short term cash requirements  such as operating expenses  maintenance capital expenditures  debt service payments and quarterly distributions to our partners  are expected to be funded by operating cash flows 
margin requirements associated with our derivative transactions are generally supported by letters of credit issued under our credit facility 
we expect to fund long term cash requirements for enhancements  expansion projects  and acquisitions from several sources  including cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our commercial paper program  our credit facility  and the issuance of additional equity and debt securities 
our ability to complete future debt and equity offerings and the timing of any such offerings will depend on various factors  including prevailing market conditions  interest rates  our financial condition and credit rating at the time 
our current business strategy emphasizes developing and expanding our existing liquids and natural gas businesses with less focus on acquisitions 
the internal growth projects we have planned for our natural gas business see natural gas segment future prospects  coupled with the southern access and alberta clipper projects on our lakehead system see liquids segment future prospects  will require significant expenditures of capital over the next several years 
we expect to fund these expenditures from a balanced combination of additional issuances of partnership units and long term debt 
our planned internal growth projects will require us to bear the cost of constructing these new assets before we will begin to realize a return on them 
capital resources equity capital execution of our growth strategy and completion of our planned construction projects contemplate our accessing the public and private equity markets to obtain the capital necessary to fund these projects 
during  we obtained approximately million of cash through equity issuances in both public and private transactions  including contributions of approximately million from our general partner to maintain its two percent general partner interest 
we used the proceeds from these offerings to repay outstanding commercial paper we had previously issued to finance a portion of our capital expansion projects and for use in future periods to fund additional expenditures under our capital expansion programs

available credit a significant source of our liquidity is provided by the commercial paper market 
we have a million commercial paper program that is supported by our long term credit facility  which we access primarily to provide temporary financing for our operating activities  capital expenditures and acquisitions  at rates that are generally lower than the rates available under our credit facility 
in the second half of  the domestic credit markets were adversely affected by a sharp increase in the credit risk associated with us asset backed securities 
due to the increase in perceived risks in the credit markets  and the need of large financial institutions to preserve capital  investors turned to investments in us government securities  while selling off more risky credit securities 
the lack of demand for domestic credit instruments other than us government securities have  at times  limited our ability to access the commercial paper markets 
however  our credit facility  which supports our commercial paper program  continues to provide us with adequate liquidity to fund our growth projects 
in addition to our credit facility  we executed an unsecured revolving credit agreement with enbridge us inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of enbridge inc the eus credit agreement in december  which provides us with access to an additional million of financing under substantially the same terms as our credit facility 
although the us credit markets remain volatile  we were able to successfully raise approximately million during the second half of through the issuance of million of our senior  unsecured zero coupon notes due the zero coupon notes and million of our fixed floating rate  unsecured  long term junior subordinated notes due both of these issuances are discussed below and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in
