our operations are divided into two business segments security system integration integration and specialty products and services specialty 
the integration segment provides cradle to grave services for a wide variety of security  communications and control systems 
the company specializes in turn key systems that integrate many different technologies 
systems are customized to meet the specific needs of its customers 
through the specialty segment we provide emergency preparedness programs  and specialized radio frequency communication equipment and integration 
each of the company s segments markets nationwide with an emphasis in the arizona  california  colorado  maryland  new jersey  new york  texas and virginia 
customers are primarily medium and large businesses and governmental agencies 
the company derives a majority of its revenues from project installations and  to a smaller extent  maintenance service revenue 
our vision and strategy our vision is to maintain our leadership position in security technology 
we intend to do this in part by providing advice on product selection and system design  examining and thoroughly testing each security product as it would be set up for use in our customers facilities  and using only systems and components that are reliable and efficient to use 
in addition to growing the business organically  we have been actively pursuing the strategic acquisition of synergistic integrators and specialty products and service companies to further fuel steady growth 
consistent with our expansion strategy  we acquired seven companies since may of  which include the two acquisitions made in october see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
to finance our acquisitions  we have used a combination of internally generated cash  the sale of company common stock and bank debt 
we currently have a million credit facility with td banknorth  which includes a million term loan of which  was outstanding at december  as part of our credit facility we also have a million revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility were  at december  it is our expectation and intent to use cash and to incur additional debt as appropriate to finance future working capital and acquisitions 
additionally  to fund future acquisitions we would consider the issuance of subordinated debt  or the sale of equity securities  or the sale of existing company assets 
trends we anticipate that the overall average operating margins for our business to be approximately for  as compared to operating margins of essentially breakeven   and for years  and  respectively 
there are several factors impacting operating margins  including levels of competition for a particular project and the size of the project 
as a significant amount of our costs are relatively fixed  such as labor costs  increases or decreases in revenues can have a significant impact on operating margins 
the company continually monitors costs and pursues cost control measures and sales initiatives to improve operating margins 
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting pronouncements in june  fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
under fin  the tax effects of a position should be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the company has adopted the provisions of fin as of january   but this did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
on september   the securities exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab topic no 
 financial statements considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab addresses how a registrant should evaluate whether an error in its financial statements is material 
the sec staff concludes in sab that materiality should be evaluated using both the rollover and iron curtain methods 
registrants are required to comply with the guidance in sab in financial statements for fiscal years ending after november  after analyzing the materiality of the impact arising from the deficiencies related to the accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sab  management concluded that the financial statements for the years ended december  and included as part of this annual report on form k  and the selected financial data included as item of this annual report on form k should be corrected to reflect the proper accounting 
the impact resulting from these corrections for income tax accounting that had an income statement impact was to increase decrease tax expense by    and  for the years ended december    and  respectively  with a corresponding increase or decrease to net tax liabilities 
the impact resulting from these corrections for income tax accounting that only had a balance sheet impact was to increase net deferred tax liabilities by    and  for the years ended december    and  respectively  with a corresponding net increase to goodwill 
unadjusted differences were not material to or individually to the prior years 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued no 
 fair value measurements 
this new standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the fasb believes the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
statement applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
under statement  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
in this standard  the fasb clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  statement establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the provisions of statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is encouraged  provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year  including any financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
on february  the fasb issued financial staff position fsp no 
which deferred the effective date of fas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years for item within the scope of the fsp 
the company is currently quantifying the impact of sfas no 
in february  fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fas on its financial statements 
fasb is currently working on amendments to the existing accounting standards governing asset transfers and fair value measurements in business combinations and impairment tests  among other issues 
upon completion of these standards  the company will need to re evaluate its accounting and disclosures 
due to the ongoing deliberations of the standard setters  the company is unable to accurately determine the effect of future amendments or proposals at this time 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management uses its best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external professional advice 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from a project in either the integration or specialty segments are recognized on the percentage of completion method  whereby revenue and the related gross profit are determined based upon the actual costs incurred to date for the project to the total estimated project costs at completion 
project costs generally include all material and shipping costs  the company s direct labor  subcontractor costs and an allocation of indirect costs related to the direct labor 
changes in the project scope  site conditions  staff performance and delays or problems with the equipment used on the project can result in increased costs that may not be billable or accepted by the customer and results in a loss or lower profit than was originally anticipated at the time of the proposal 
estimates for the costs to complete the project are continuously updated by management during the performance of the project 
provisions for changes in estimated costs and losses  if any  on uncompleted projects are made in the period in which such changes are determined 
in general  we determine a project to be substantially completed after the scope of work is completed  which includes installing the equipment as required in the contract 
system is functional and has been tested 
training has been provided 
the majority of the company s projects are completed within a year 
revenue from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
service contracts  which are generally separate and distinct agreements from project agreements  are billed either monthly or quarterly on the last day of the month covered by the contract 
accordingly  revenue from service contracts are recognized ratably over the length of the agreement 
in and  the company did not bundle any significant service contracts with our systems installation work 
trade receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are stated at net realizable value 
this value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts 
the allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon historical experience with the customer  the aging of the past due amounts and the relationship with and economic status of our customers 
the evaluation is based upon estimates taking into account the facts and circumstances at the time of the evaluation 
actual uncollectible accounts could exceed our estimates and changes to its estimates will be accounted for in the period of change 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
our trade receivables are not collateralized 
inventory valuation inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost has been determined using the first in  first out method 
inventory quantities on hand are regularly reviewed  and where necessary  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories are recorded warranty the company offers warranties on all products  including parts and labor that range from one year to three years depending upon the type of product concerned 
for products made by others  the company passes along the manufacturer s warranty to the end user 
intangible assets the company s intangible assets include goodwill and other intangibles that consist of the fair value of acquired customer lists  service contracts acquired  trade names  and covenants not to compete 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired at the date of acquisition 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial and accounting standards sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with that statement  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but are tested at least annually for impairment 
prior to january   the company had not recorded goodwill or other intangible assets of indefinite lives 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives  consisting primarily of acquired customer lists  service contracts and covenants not to compete are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to fifteen years and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
if the intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  the intangible asset will be amortized over the remaining useful life 
if the asset being amortized is determined to have an indefinite useful life  the asset will be tested for impairment 
the impairment test will consist of measuring its fair value with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the intangible assets exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for an amount equal to the excess and the adjusted carrying amount is recognized as its new accounting basis 
the company s goodwill impairment test is based on a two part procedure consistent with the requirements of sfas the first test consists of determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  a second test is performed 
in step two  the implied fair value of the goodwill which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the net assets is compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess value of goodwill over the implied value 
we determined the reporting unit by analyzing geographic regions  as management evaluates the company s performance in this manner 
we have identified five separate and distinct operating units for the testing requirements of sfas  and evaluate each reporting unit for impairment 
income taxes deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment

cis security systems corp 
cis virginia and maryland operations acquired in october accounted for  of the increase in revenues 
new jersey s revenues increased significantly as a result of the contracts awarded by large public agencies in the new york metropolitan area at the end of and early for the year ended december   the company experienced continued revenue improvement from our arizona division  as well as improvements in our colorado  texas and california divisions 
revenues from governmental agencies represented and of total revenues  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
booked orders increased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the corresponding period of cost of revenue cost of revenue for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the gross profit margin for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the decline in the gross profit margin was driven principally from the california and new jersey operations 
california s margin decline was the result of cost overruns on a number of projects that were quoted late in and early the decline in new jersey in the first quarter of was the result of cost overruns on a number of installations 
in addition  as discussed above in revenue  several large projects were booked in new jersey at the end of and early in these projects carry gross profit margins that are below the company s historical average 
therefore  while gross margin percentages declined in new jersey for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year  because of the significant increase in revenue from these larger projects  gross profit dollars actually increased by year over year 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of or  was primarily attributed to increased costs associated with the cis acquisition in our fourth quarter  as well as higher corporate costs  due mainly to organizational changes  and costs incurred in addressing the internal control weaknesses identified in item a of the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   as well as costs incurred in preparation for sarbanes oxley implementation  partially offset by lower bad debt expense and improved labor utilization

for the year ended december   principally as a result of the loss before tax incurred by the company  there was an overall tax benefit of  this benefit was partially offset by state income taxes for those jurisdictions that were profitable during the period 
the write off of the goodwill discussed above is a permanent difference under fasb  accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  there was no tax benefit taken for this write off 
net income as a result of the above noted factors our net loss was  for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  this resulted in diluted loss per share of on weighted average common shares outstanding of  for the year ended december   as compared to diluted loss per share of on weighted average common shares outstanding of  for the year ended december  comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  analysis of consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  corrected change revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling  general administrative expenses goodwill intangible asset impairment charges operating loss profit interest income other expense interest expense loss income before tax expense tax expense benefit net loss income after taxes revenue revenue for the year ended december  was  representing a slight decrease as compared to  for the year ended december  in  the new jersey  viscom and texas divisions experienced declines in revenues 
the decline in new jersey resulted from the wind down of two large projects in the new york metro area 
lower revenue from our viscom group was attributable to a large project with the santa clara valley transportation authority in that was not replaced in in response to the decline in revenues in our texas division  changes in management were made to more effectively take advantage of the opportunities that exist in this market 
these declines in revenues were offset by revenue from securus colorado operations acquired in october and cis security systems corp 
cis virginia and maryland operations acquired in october and higher revenue from our california and arizona regions 
revenues from cis were  for the year ended december  revenues from governmental agencies represented and of total revenues  for the years ended december  and  respectively

the decline in viscom gross profit margins was a direct result of wind down of the santa clara vta project discussed in the revenue section above and the million write down of slow moving inventory associated with the viscom product line 
poor performance from the texas division contributed to the decline in gross profit margin 
the decline at airorlite largely resulted from the investment that was made by this division to support a project for a large legacy customer 
this investment resulted in a solution for time delay interference tdi in in building wireless systems 
this solution for tdi is expected to have wider commercial application potential 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of or  was primarily attributed to costs associated with the securus acquisition made in october  the cis acquisition made in october  lower utilization rates due in part to the move to our new offices in fair lawn  nj  additional accruals related to our paid time off liability and higher commissions
