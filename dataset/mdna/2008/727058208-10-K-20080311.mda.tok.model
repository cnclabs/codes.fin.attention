we realized net proceeds of approximately million from the private placement after deducting fees payable to the placement agent and other transaction costs 
on january   we announced that we have retained the services of allen company  llc to assist us in evaluating strategic alternatives  including a possible sale of the company 
executive operating and financial summary our total revenue was million in fiscal  decreasing from our prior year s revenue of million  due primarily to decreases in our subscription and transaction services revenue 
total operating costs and expenses were million in fiscal  increasing from the prior year total of million 
these increases were primarily due to impairment charges to goodwill of million and impairment charges to intangible assets of million 
operating costs and expenses also increased due to increased marketing costs related to direct mail campaigns for our print properties  severance charges related to the departure of our former president and chief operating officer and our former chief technology officer  increased legal expenses  increased costs to integrate and re architect the core technology platform of our websites and increased depreciation on capital expenditures as a result our on going product development and compliance efforts 
loss from operations was million in fiscal  compared to a loss from operations of million in fiscal this increase in loss from operations was primarily the result of the impairment charges to goodwill and intangible assets  the other increases in operating costs and expenses noted above and the decrease in revenue noted above 
we expect that revenue will decrease slightly in fiscal in comparison to fiscal  primarily as a result of the planned divestiture of the specpub inc asset group and an anticipated decrease in online subscription services revenue 
we expect our operating loss will decrease in fiscal in comparison to fiscal  due to non recurrence in of the impairment charges recognized in fiscal however  we expect to incur additional expenses in re designing our technological architecture  rewriting our web applications and rebuilding our technology platform and networks during fiscal results of operations segment performance is measured based on contribution margin loss  which consists of total revenues from external customers less direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses include cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses 
segment managers do not have discretionary control over other operating costs and expenses such as general and administrative costs consisting of costs such as corporate management  human resources  finance and legal  and depreciation and amortization  as such  other operating costs and expenses are not evaluated in the measurement of segment performance 
online segment we derive online advertising revenue from advertising contracts in which we typically undertake to deliver a minimum number of impressions to users over a specified time period for a fixed fee 
we derive online subscription services revenue from paid membership subscriptions to our online media properties 
transaction services revenue includes revenue generated from the sale of products through multiple transaction based websites

com website  a decrease in sales of products on our transaction based website properties and a reduction in our national and local advertising sales due in part to turnover in our digital sales staff 
online cost of revenue increased primarily as a result of increased costs to integrate and re architect the core technology platform of our websites  and  to a lesser extent  increased severance and other costs related to the departure of our former chief technology officer 
online sales and marketing expenses decreased as a result of decreased spending on advertising during fiscal for fiscal  we expect that online revenue will decrease from fiscal as a result of anticipated additional reductions in the number of online subscribers and reductions in online revenues contributed by the specpub inc assets group  which we plan to divest ourselves of within the next twelve months 
we expect that online cost of revenue will increase as we continue to re architect our core technology platform of our websites  partially offset by reductions in online cost of revenue contributed by the specpub inc asset group 
for fiscal  we expect that sales and marketing expenses may vary with the comparable prior year period depending on the timing of planned advertising to coincide with certain product development milestones

these other operating costs and expenses are not evaluated in the measurement of segment performance since segment managers do not have discretionary control over these costs and expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of payroll and related benefits for executive  finance  administrative and other corporate personnel  occupancy costs  professional fees  insurance and other general corporate expenses 
our general and administrative expenses were million for  up from the prior year 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were for  up from in the prior year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue were due to increased compensation and employee related costs including severance and other costs related to the departure of our president and chief operating officer in march  increased legal expenses  and increased stock based compensation expenses 
our general and administrative expenses were million for  up from the prior year 
this increase was due to the incremental effect of the acquisition of lpi  increased compensation and employee related costs as a result of increases in headcount  other relocation and retention charges  and integration and other expenses associated with the acquisition of lpi such as increased legal and insurance expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were for both and for fiscal  we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease from fiscal primarily due to decreased compensation and employee related costs as a result of decreases in headcount and decreased legal costs 
restructuring 
in june  our board of directors adopted and approved a reorganization plan to align our resources with our strategic business objectives 
as part of the plan  we consolidated our media and advertising services  e commerce services and back office operations on a global basis to streamline our operations as part of continued integration of our acquired businesses 
the reorganization  along with other organizational changes  reduced our total workforce by approximately 
restructuring costs of approximately million  primarily related to employee severance benefits of approximately million and facilities consolidation expenses of approximately million  were recorded during we completed this restructuring in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents  with certain payments continuing beyond in accordance with the terms of existing severance and other agreements 
in july  our board of directors adopted and approved a reorganization plan to further align our resources with our strategic business objectives 
as part of the plan  we closed our international offices located in buenos aires and london in order to streamline our business operations and reduce expenses 
the reorganization  along with other organizational changes  reduced our total workforce by approximately 
restructuring costs of approximately  primarily related to employee severance benefits of approximately  and facilities consolidation expenses of approximately  were recorded during we completed this restructuring in the fourth quarter of depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for fiscal  up from the prior year  due primarily to an increase in depreciation expense related to capital expenditures we have made in order to support our on going online product development and compliance efforts 
amortization of intangible assets was million due to intangible assets which we capitalized in connection with the acquisition of lpi 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue was for  up from in the prior year 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for fiscal  up from the prior year  due primarily to an increase in the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of lpi and increased capital expenditures to support our on going online product development and compliance efforts 
amortization of intangible assets was million due to intangible assets which we capitalized in connection with the acquisition of lpi 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue was for  down from in the prior year 
for fiscal  we expect depreciation and amortization expense will increase over fiscal as a result of capital investments to support our on going online product development  and to integrate and re architect the core technology platform of our websites 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
during  we recorded impairment charges to goodwill and to intangible assets of million and million  respectively 
during the three months ended june   we recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of million  primarily resulting from lower than expected advertising revenue related to our publishing segment which we believe resulted in a significant decrease in the trading price of our common stock and a corresponding reduction in our market capitalization 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional impairment charge to goodwill of million related to the winding down of our international marketing efforts and the closure of our international offices in conjunction with our july restructuring plan 
also during the fourth quarter of  we revised our second quarter impairment estimate as a result of the completion of an independent business valuation of certain of our intangible assets and recorded an additional impairment charge of million to our intangible assets for the year ended december  other income and expenses interest expense 
interest expense was million for fiscal  an increase of from the prior year  due primarily to increased interest expense on the orix term and revolving loans entered into in september  offset partially by a decrease in interest expense on the lpi note entered into in november interest expense was million for fiscal  an increase of from the prior year  due primarily to the issuance of the note payable in connection with the acquisition of lpi as well as the orix term and revolving loans 
in july  we used a portion of the proceeds of our equity financing to repay  in full  our indebtedness obligations under loans from orix  as well as our obligations under the lpi note 
interest expense for the year ended december  includes prepayment fees of million  loan deferral fees of million and million for acceleration of the loan discount 
other income  net 
other income  net consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments as well as other miscellaneous non operating transactions 
other income  net was million for fiscal  a decrease of from the prior year  primarily due to decreased interest income during fiscal on our lower cash balance 
other income  net was million for fiscal  a decrease of from the prior year  primarily due to decreased interest income during fiscal on our lower cash balance as a result of the acquisitions of lpi in november and rsvp in march 
table of contents discontinued operations in an effort to simplify our business model  we discontinued our travel and events businesses during in march  we sold our membership interest in dsw  a joint venture  to the minority interest partner 
in december  we sold substantially all the assets of rsvp 
as a result of the sale of our interest in dsw  the sale of substantially all the assets of rsvp and our decision to exit our travel and events businesses  we have reported the results of operations and financial position of rsvp and dsw as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and in accordance with fas we have reported the financial position of rsvp and dsw as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  in addition  we have segregated the cash flow activity of rsvp and dsw from the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december  and the results of operations of rsvp and dsw were previously reported and included in the results of operations and financial position of our travel and events segment 
the results of discontinued operations for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands year ended december  year ended december  rsvp dsw total rsvp dsw total total revenue operating costs and expenses cost of revenue sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill and intangible assets total operating costs and expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss from discontinued operations 
table of contents the current and non current assets and liabilities of discontinued operations of rsvp and dsw were as follows in thousands december  rsvp dsw total current assets of discontinued operations accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets long term assets of discontinued operations property and equipment  net goodwill intangible assets  net current liabilities of discontinued operations accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities deferred revenue  current portion critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis on which we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because this can vary in each situation  actual results may differ from the estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue principally from the sale of premium subscription services  magazine subscriptions  banner and sponsorship advertisements  magazine advertisements and transactions services 
premium online subscription services are generally for a period of one month to twelve months 
premium online subscription services are generally paid for upfront by credit card  subject to cancellations by subscribers or charge backs from transaction processors 
revenue  net of estimated cancellations and charge backs  is recognized ratably over the service term 
to date  cancellations and charge backs have not been significant and have been within management s expectations 
deferred magazine subscription revenue results from advance payments for magazine subscriptions received from subscribers and is amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the subscription as issues are delivered 
we provide an estimated reserve for magazine subscription cancellations at the time such subscription revenues are recorded 
newsstand revenues are recognized based on the on sale dates of magazines and are recorded based upon estimates of sales  net of product placement costs paid to resellers 
estimated returns from newsstand revenues are recorded based upon historical experience 
in january  we began offering our customers premium online subscription services bundled with magazine subscriptions 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 
table of contents revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  we defer subscription revenue on bundled subscription service offerings based on the pro rata fair value of the individual premium online subscription services and magazine subscriptions 
to date  the duration of our banner advertising commitments has ranged from one week to one year 
sponsorship advertising contracts have terms ranging from three months to two years and also involve more integration with our services  such as the placement of buttons that provide users with direct links to the advertiser s website 
advertising revenue on both banner and sponsorship contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  provided that we have no significant obligations remaining at the end of a period and collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured  at the lesser of the ratio of impressions delivered over the total number of undertaken impressions or the straight line basis 
our obligations typically include undertakings to deliver a minimum number of impressions  or times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our online properties 
to the extent that these minimums are not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenue until the minimums are achieved 
magazine advertising revenues are recognized  net of related agency commissions  on the date the magazines are placed on sale at the newsstands 
revenues received for advertisements in magazines to go on sale in future months are classified as deferred advertising revenue 
transaction service revenue generated from sale of products held in inventory is recognized when the product is shipped net of estimated returns 
we also earn commissions for facilitating the sale of third party products and services which are recognized when earned based on reports provided by third party vendors or upon cash receipt if no reports are provided 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the revenue earned for facilitating the sale of third party merchandise is reported net of cost as agent 
this revenue is reported net due to the fact that although we receive the order and collect money from buyer  we are under no obligation to make payment to the third party unless payment has been received from the buyer and risk of return is also borne by the third party 
advertising costs 
costs related to advertising and promotion are charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred except for direct response advertising costs which are amortized over the expected life of the subscription  typically a twelve month period 
direct response advertising costs consist primarily of production costs associated with direct mail promotion of magazine subscriptions 
valuation allowances 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
we accrue an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances in the same period that the related revenue is recorded based on historical information  adjusted for current economic trends 
to the extent actual returns and allowances vary from the estimated experience  revisions to the allowance may be required 
significant management judgments and estimates are made and used in connection with establishing the sales and allowances reserve in any accounting period 
we record a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets primarily from our net operating losses 
in the future  if we generate sufficient taxable income and we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would impact the results of operations in that period 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
our long lived assets include goodwill  intangibles  property and equipment 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment in determining the fair value of our reporting units and our enterprise as a whole 
we conduct our annual test as of december each year 
future impairment losses may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we record an impairment charge on intangibles or long lived assets to be held and used when we determine that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable and or exceed their carrying value 

table of contents based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we determine to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of cash flow require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
capitalized website development costs 
we capitalize the costs of enhancing and developing features for our websites when we believe that the capitalization criteria for these activities have been met and amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life  generally three years 
we expense the cost of enhancing and developing features for our websites in cost of revenue only when we believe that capitalization criteria have not been met 
we exercise judgment in determining when to begin capitalizing costs and the period over which we amortize the capitalized costs 
if different judgments were made  it would have an impact on our results of operations 
stock based compensation 
we have granted stock options to employees and non employee directors 
we recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments granted after december  and prior to but not yet vested as of december   in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment fas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award normally the vesting period 
prior to fas r adoption  we accounted for stock based payments under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
in anticipation of the impact of adopting fas r  we accelerated the vesting of approximately  shares subject to outstanding stock options in december the primary purpose of the acceleration of vesting was to minimize the amount of compensation expense recognized in relation to the options in future periods following the adoption by us of fas r 
since we accelerated these shares and adopted fas r using the modified prospective method  we did not record any one time charges relating to the transition to fas r and the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include any impact of fas r 
as a result of fas r  we expect to award restricted stock and restricted stock units or other compensation in lieu of or in addition to stock options 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we use the black scholes model to value our stock option awards 
management uses an estimate of future volatility for our stock based on our historical volatility and the volatilities of comparable companies 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and management uses different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded in the current period 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
income taxes we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on january  we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and there was no effect on our financial condition or results of operations as a result of implementing fin we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
we are no longer subject to us federal tax assessment for years before state jurisdictions that remain subject to assessment range from to we do not believe there will be any material changes in our unrecognized tax positions over the next months 
we believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flow 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain 
table of contents income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to fin in addition  we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of fin our policy is that we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
as of the date of adoption of fin  we did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits  nor was any interest expense recognized during the year 
our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to increases in our deferred income tax valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows  contractual obligations  certain commitments and acquisitions on our liquidity and capital resources 
cash flow from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  and cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets  are summarized in the table below year ended december  in thousands  except percentage of total assets net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash  cash equivalents and short term investments cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments percentage of total assets cash used in operating activities for was million  due primarily to our loss from continuing operations of million and cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations of million  partially offset by impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million  loss on disposal or write off of property and equipment of million  stock based compensation expense of million and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of million

cash used in investing activities for was million  of which million was used for acquisitions of businesses  and 
table of contents million for capital assets 
investments in capital assets were comprised primarily of computer and office equipment and furniture and fixtures 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million  due primarily to the net proceeds from our equity financing of million  partially offset by payment of note obligations of million to orix  payment of the lpi note of million and million for principal payments under capital lease obligations 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million  due primarily to proceeds from issuance of notes payable of million and proceeds from the repayment of a stockholder note receivable of million  partially offset by million for principal payments under capital lease obligations and notes payable 
net cash used by financing activities for was million  consisting of million for principal payments under capital lease obligations  partially offset by cash provided by the issuance of common stock related to employee stock option exercises of million 
we expect that net cash provided by operating activities will be negative during and may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  advertising sales  subscription trends  accounts receivable collections and inventory management 
in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets of lpi for a purchase price of approximately million which consisted of million paid in cash and approximately million in the form of a note to the sellers secured by the assets of specpub  inc and payable in three equal installments in may  august and november  and the reimbursement of certain prepaid and other expenses of approximately million 
the lpi note was repaid in connection with the private placement financing in july in september  we entered into our loan agreement with orix  which was amended in february  may and june pursuant to the loan agreement  we borrowed million as a term loan and million as a month revolving loan in september the borrowings under the line of credit were limited to lesser of million  which we had already drawn down  or of qualifying accounts receivable 
the term loan was payable in consecutive monthly installments of principal beginning on november  together with interest at an initial rate of prime plus 
the term loan provided for a prepayment fee equal to of the amount prepaid in connection with any prepayment made prior to september  the revolving loan bore interest at a rate of prime plus 
the loan agreement contained certain financial ratios  financial tests and liquidity covenants 
the loans were secured by substantially all of our assets and all of the outstanding capital stock of all of our subsidiaries  except for the assets and capital stock of specpub  inc  which were pledged as security for the lpi note 
we entered into a waiver and amendment to the loan agreement in may the may waiver  pursuant to which orix waived defaults associated with our failure to meet certain financial tests and liquidity covenants 
in consideration of the may waiver  we  in addition to other commitments  agreed to maintain certain minimum cash balances  increase the interest rate on the term loan to prime plus and committed to raise at least million in new equity or subordinated debt 
at that time  we also agreed to apply at least million of the proceeds from that transaction to pay down the term loan 
as part of the amendment in june  the parties agreed to modify the requirement in the may waiver for the commitment to raise new equity or subordinated debt to be for gross proceeds of at least million  which could be completed in one or more closings  with the first closing for not less than million in proceeds  if applicable  occurring no later than july   and the entire financing being completed no later than september  in addition  orix consented to  among other things  certain limited prepayments with respect to our other indebtedness in the event of the first closing and prior to the completion of the entire financing 
orix also agreed to defer the payment of principal installments due on july  august and september with respect to its term loan for a deferral fee of  in july  we completed a private placement financing with a group of investors for approximately million in gross proceeds from the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock and used a portion of the proceeds to repay  in full  the lpi note  the orix term loan  the orix revolving loan  the deferral fee and million in prepayment fees 
during  we invested million in property and equipment of which million was financed through capital leases 
of this investment related to capitalized labor  hardware and software related to enhancements to our website infrastructure and features 
for fiscal  we expect to continue investing in our technology 
table of contents development as we improve our online technology platform and enhance our features and functionality across our network of websites 
our capital requirements depend on many factors  including the level of our revenues  the resources we devote to developing  marketing and selling our products and services  the timing and extent of our introduction of new features and services  the extent and timing of potential investments or acquisitions and other factors 
in particular  our subscription services consist of prepaid subscriptions that provide cash flows in advance of the actual provision of services 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to expand our product development and marketing efforts and for other general corporate activities 
based on our current operations  we expect that our available funds and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our expected needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next twelve months  although we can provide no assurances in that regard 
if we do not have sufficient cash available to finance our operations  we may be required to obtain additional public or private debt or equity financing 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all 
if we are unable to raise sufficient funds  we may need to reduce our planned operations 
on january   we announced that we have retained the services of allen company  llc to assist us in evaluating strategic alternatives  including a possible sale of the company 
we are actively considering such strategic alternatives 
we incurred a significant net loss in and expect to incur additional losses during we expect that raising additional financing will be very difficult  if it could be obtained at all 
accordingly  if we are unsuccessful in pursuing our strategic alternatives  we could be forced to engage in dispositions of assets or businesses on unfavorable terms  or consider curtailing or ceasing operations 
in that event  we cannot provide any assurance that our assets will be sufficient to meet our liabilities 
off balance sheet liabilities we did not have any off balance sheet liabilities or transactions as of december  other contractual commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect that these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period total after in thousands contractual obligations capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations capital lease obligations 
we hold property and equipment under noncancelable capital leases with varying maturities 
operating leases 
we lease or sublease office space and equipment under cancelable and noncancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through december  operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non cancelable operating leases for office facilities  as well as limited computer and office equipment that we utilize under operating lease arrangements 
the amounts presented are consistent with the contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly  unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to exit an office facility early or expand our occupied space 
seasonality and inflation we anticipate that our business may be affected by the seasonality of certain revenue lines 
for example  print and online advertising buys are usually higher approaching year end and lower at the beginning of a new year than at other points during the year 

table of contents inflation has not had a significant effect on our revenue or expenses historically and we do not expect it to be a significant factor in the short term 
however  inflation may affect our business in the medium term to long term 
in particular  our operating expenses may be affected by a tightening of the job market  resulting in increased pressure for salary adjustments for existing employees and higher cost of replacement for employees that are terminated or resign
