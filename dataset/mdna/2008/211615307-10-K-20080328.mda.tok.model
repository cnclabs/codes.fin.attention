item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations references to a note are to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report company overview as discussed in item  business  the company operates primarily in two industry groups  hvac and construction products 
within these two industry groups  the company has identified two reportable segments in each of the two industry groups the heating and cooling segment and the evaporative cooling segment in the hvac industry group and the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment and the door segment in the construction products industry group 
the heating and cooling segment produces and sells gas fired wall furnaces  console heaters and fan coils from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  williams furnace co 
wfc of colton  california 
the evaporative cooling segment produces and sells evaporative coolers from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  phoenix manufacturing  inc pmi of phoenix  arizona 
sales of these two segments are nationwide  but are concentrated in the southwestern united states 
concrete  aggregates and construction supplies are offered from numerous locations along the front range of colorado operated by the company s wholly owned subsidiaries castle concrete company and transit mix concrete co  of colorado springs  transit mix of pueblo  inc of pueblo and rocky mountain ready mix concrete  inc of denver 
doors are fabricated and sold along with the related hardware from colorado springs and pueblo through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  mckinney door and hardware  inc of pueblo  colorado 
sales of these two segments are highly concentrated in the front range area in colorado although door sales are also made throughout the united states 
in addition to the above reporting segments  an unallocated corporate classification is used to report the unallocated expenses of the corporate office which provides treasury  insurance and tax services as well as strategic business planning and general management services and an other classification is used to report a real estate operation 
expenses related to the corporate information technology group are allocated to all locations  including the corporate office 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources sales of the company s hvac products are seasonal and weather sensitive except for fan coils 
revenues in the company s concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment are influenced by the level of construction activity and weather conditions along the front range of colorado 
sales for the door segment are not as strongly seasonal nor are they much affected by weather conditions 
historically  the company has experienced operating losses during the first quarter except when the weather is mild along the front range 
operating results typically improve in the second and third quarters reflecting more favorable weather conditions in colorado and the seasonal sales of the evaporative cooling segment 
fourth quarter results can vary based on weather conditions in colorado as well as in the principal markets for the company s heating equipment 
the company typically experiences operating cash flow deficits during the first half of the year reflecting operating results  the use of sales dating programs extended payment terms related to the evaporative cooling segment and payments of the prior year s accrued incentive bonuses and company profit sharing contributions 
as a result  the company s borrowings against its revolving credit facility tend to peak during the second quarter and then decline over the remainder of the year 
while this seasonal pattern of sales has prevailed in  operating results declined in the third and fourth quarters of the year as discussed in more detail in the results of operations section of item the company s borrowings against its revolving credit facility peaked in october and as a result of the fourth quarter s operating loss and a higher level of inventories  the outstanding revolving credit at year end was  cash and cash equivalents were  at the end of compared to  at the prior year end 
operations in provided  of cash compared to  in and  generated in the increase in net cash generated by operating activities during was primarily the result of a decrease in receivables of  compared to the increase in receivables of  during this increase in cash generated was partially offset by the net loss and an increase in inventory levels compared to the decrease in net cash generated by operating activities in compared to was due to changes in working capital  principally an increase in receivables of  during compared to a decrease in receivables of  during the increase in receivables was largely due to the increased sales in all segments during the fourth quarter of compared to and to some slowing of collections at our colorado businesses 
net cash used in investing activities was  in   in  and  in capital expenditures for  and were   and  respectively  exclusive of the  expended during for those assets purchased as part of the asci and cssl acquisitions 
current year expenditures were predominantly in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment including over  to complete the industrial sand plant 
an additional  was expended to purchase an existing building in colorado springs for the company s door business to replace a smaller and older facility 
expenditures during included  for the first outlay on an industrial sand plant while the remaining additions consisted primarily of routine equipment replacements 
expenditures during included completion of a batch plant in pueblo and fines recovery system for the colorado springs sand operation as well as the capitalization of subsidized leasehold improvements in the new office space leased for the corporate office 
an additional  was used in for the purchase of the asci and cssl assets 
on january  the company purchased the assets of cssl for  in cash including  of goodwill and  for a non compete agreement 
on june   the company purchased certain assets of asci for  of cash and a  note the remaining balance due on the note at december  of  was paid off during 
in addition to the  of trucks  equipment and concrete plant  the asci purchase price included  for a non compete agreement   for a restrictive land covenant   for existing customer relations and  of goodwill 
investing activities provided cash from the proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of   and  during  and  respectively 
the and sales were mainly of equipment replaced during the year 
the sales of an excess parcel of land adjacent to one of the colorado springs batch plants and the site of the closed pueblo west plant accounted for  of the cash proceeds 
in addition  during the company received a note for  related to the sales of the colorado springs property 
the note bears interest at prime plus and calls for monthly payments of  or more 
budgeted capital expenditures for are approximately  which is approximately  less than planned depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the budget includes approximately  for expansion of the pueblo east aggregates operations including the construction of a slurry wall 
the remaining expenditures are primarily for routine replacement and upgrades 
the company expects that the expenditures will be funded from existing cash balances and operating cash flow 
during  cash of  was provided by financing activities 
as more fully discussed in note   was borrowed against the revolving line of credit to finance operating and working capital needs and capital expenditures 
scheduled debt repayment of  were made during the year as well as the pay off of the remaining  owed on the note issued as part of the purchase price of asci 
an additional  was used to acquire treasury shares during during  cash of  was provided by financing activities 
as more fully discussed in note  the principal amount of the term loan was increased by  during  primarily to fund the acquisition of the assets of asci and to pay for the industrial sand plant 
see additional discussion of the term loan under revolving credit and term loan agreement  below 
scheduled debt repayments of  were made during the year 
in addition  scheduled payments of  were made against the  note issued as part of the purchase price of asci leaving a balance due of  at december  during  cash of  was used in financing activities 
the principal amount of the term loan was increased by  during approximately  of the proceeds were used to fund the purchase of the company s stock under the modified dutch auction tender offer completed during the second quarter  and to pay related fees and expenses 
under the company s ongoing share repurchase program  an additional  was used to acquire shares during a total of  shares were acquired during scheduled long term debt payments of  were made during the year 
during  the remaining outstanding options were exercised for  shares  shares net of  shares tendered as payment of option price which generated proceeds of  for the company and resulted in a  tax benefit the tax benefit is classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
revolving credit and term loan agreement the company signed a revolving credit and term loan agreement credit agreement with lasalle bank national association and fifth third bank during september at december    was outstanding under the term loan facility 
on march   the company entered into an amended and restated term loan and revolving credit agreement the amended credit agreement 
this amended credit agreement increased the revolving credit facility from  to  until september  on september   the revolving credit facility is reduced back to  the temporary increase in the revolving credit facility is to provide additional liquidity during the company s peak seasonal credit need 
the amended credit agreement provides that  at the company s option  the term loan and revolving credit facility will bear interest at prime or a performance based libor rate 
based on the terms of the amended credit agreement and the company s performance for the twelve months ended december   the performance based rate would be libor plus for both the term loan and for borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
such rate is subject to adjustment depending upon the company s performance 
payment of accrued interest is due and payable quarterly by the company 
payments of principal under the term loan are payable on a quarterly basis  ending on march  the amended credit agreement extends the revolving credit facility until june  and accordingly  the outstanding revolving credit balance at december  was classified as a long term obligation 
at december   there was  outstanding against the revolving credit facility leaving  available after reserving  for the outstanding stand by letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility is available at the discretion of management 
it is primarily used for funding the seasonal sales programs related to the evaporative cooler and furnace product lines 
as noted  the line is also used to secure stand by letters of credit to insurance carriers in support of self insured amounts under the company s risk management program 
during the fiscal year  the highest amount of company borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement  not including the amount securing stand by letters of credit  was  and the average amount outstanding was  at december   the company was not in compliance with the leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement 
the company has obtained a waiver of the requirement for the year end 
the leverage ratio requirement has been modified by the amended credit agreement beginning in the company expects to be in compliance with the amended agreement throughout the principal reasons for not meeting the required leverage ratio was the high level of capital expenditures and the loss incurred in during fiscal  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement swap agreement covering the period december  through december  in order to minimize the adverse impact of the floating interest rate characteristic of some of the company s term loan borrowing 
the company s effective interest rate on the portion of the outstanding term loan covered by the swap agreement was during the effect on the operations was to increase net income by approximately  there were no swap agreements outstanding during the company believes that its existing cash balance and anticipated cash flow from operations  supplemented by seasonal borrowings available under the revolving line of credit as amended  will be sufficient to cover expected cash needs  including servicing debt and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
insurance policies the company maintained insurance policies since march  with the following per incident deductibles and policy limits deductible policy limits product and general liability workers compensation statutory auto and truck liability should the aggregated out of pocket payments for the three policies exceed  during a policy year  deductibles on future claims are waived and the policies pay all amounts up to the policy limits 
should any  or all policy limits be exceeded  an umbrella policy is maintained which covers the next  of claims

results of operations this section discusses consolidated results 
the following sections discuss the results of the reporting segments and contain more detail 
consolidated sales were  in   in and  in the increase in was primarily realized by the heating and cooling segment  and the door segment 
increased fan coil sales were the principal reason for the higher sales in the heating and cooling segment while a continued strong demand and the timing of shipments accounted for the door segment sales increase 
the increase in over was realized by all four segments as virtually all products ended the year with higher volumes than achieved in the primary driver of the sales increase was the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment as a result of both volume and price increases 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  depletion and amortization increased as a percentage of sales from to 
the increase in cost of sales was experienced by all segments except the door segment 
increased material  healthcare and factory overhead costs drove margins lower in the heating and cooling and evaporative cooling segments 
higher cement and delivery costs lead to the decreased margins in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment despite the recovery of  in from the insurance claim for flood damages in increased competitive pricing resulting from reduced construction activity along the front range in colorado prevented price increases from fully recapturing the increased costs 
the improvement in the door segment was largely due to the increase in sales 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  depletion and amortization remained relatively constant at for both and the effect of flooding at two of our aggregates operations in july and august of reduced the effect of price increases and operating efficiencies in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment 
door margins declined due to lower margins in the newly acquired electronic access business 
price competition and some dramatic material cost increases narrowed the margins of the heating and cooling segment while the evaporative cooling segment improved margins primarily due to a shift in product mix to larger industrial units 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased in compared to due to the high level of capital expenditures 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased from to due to increased capital expenditures during and amortization of intangible assets associated with the asci and cssl acquisitions 
selling and administrative costs increased but remained relatively constant as a percentage of sales at 
the increased costs were partially related to the increase in sales of the heating and cooling segment and the door segment 
however  increases in employee healthcare  compliance costs associated with sox  insurance and legal expenses associated with product liability claims were the primary causes for the increase in selling and administrative costs 
during  selling and administrative costs increased both in dollars and as a percentage of sales  although the latter only modestly from in to in much of the increase was due to the increased sales volume 
selling and administrative costs at the corporate office were relatively constant between and operating results declined from a profit of  to a loss of  the dramatic decline was the result of the deterioration of margins in all but the door segment combined with the lower volume in the concrete business 
administrative costs for declined from the level largely due to lower incentive based compensation 
the gain on the disposition of property and equipment declined during compared to as there were few sales during the year 
during  gains were realized on numerous dispositions of equipment that were replaced during the year 
the gains were unusually high as they included  on the sales of property in colorado 
operating income declined from  in to  in despite the increase in sales largely due to the margin decline and increased selling and administrative costs in the heating and cooling segment 
the expenses related to the flooding at two of our aggregate operations  as well as the decrease in gains on the sale of property and equipment  also reduced operating income in other income for included a  gain on the sale of stock received from the demutualization of one of our insurance carriers 
net interest expense increased over the prior year in both and due to increased borrowings as well as higher average interest rates during both years 
the company s effective income tax rates reflect federal and state statutory rates adjusted for non deductible and other tax items 
the effective tax rate for was a benefit of 
the primary increases to the benefit from the statutory rate of was the benefit realized from percentage depletion and the benefit for future state tax credits resulting from operations within an enterprise zone in california 
the effective rate for was increased by for adjustments made to state taxes and reduced by for the benefit realized from percentage depletion 
the effective rate for was reduced by for adjustments made to the accrual for tax contingencies as a result of the closure of tax years subject to audits by taxing authorities 
the effective rate was also reduced by for percentage depletion 
the company reviews its tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for potential tax contingencies 
based on these reviews and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit  reserves are adjusted as necessary 
reserves for these tax matters are included in income taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
see note as discussed above  the company operates primarily in two industry groups both of which are somewhat seasonal  weather sensitive and subject to cyclical factors 
the following addresses various aspects of operating performance focusing on the reportable segments within each of the two industry groups 
construction products industry group as discussed in note  as a result of certain organizational changes  we have reevaluated our segments reporting under financial accounting standards board fasb statement  disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the door division of tmc  previously reported within the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment is now reported within the door segment 
accordingly  the information presented in the table below has been restated to conform to the current year s segment composition 
the table below presents a summary of operating information for the two reportable segments within the construction products industry group for the fiscal years  and amounts in thousands 
concrete  aggregates and construction supplies door revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets as restated revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets as restated revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment sales in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment declined  to  despite increased sales prices 
the decline was attributable to a decline in concrete volume as construction along the front range of colorado has slowed significantly over the past year 
delivery costs increased due to higher prices for diesel fuel and a higher level of repairs and maintenance expenditures 
as the communities serviced expand  traffic increases and more of our sales occur further from our batch plant sites 
in the pueblo market  a significant portion of the increased delivery costs can be attributable to the quick turn around times we enjoyed servicing two very large jobs in pricing became more competitive in all colorado markets as demand fell which prevented our price increases from fully recovering the increased costs 
the aggregates division reported improved sales during although profits were aided by the  insurance recovery related to the flood damage claims 
the construction supplies division reported declines in sales directly related to the lower construction activity during sales in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment improved to  in  an increase of  or over the amount of  the improvement was primarily due to three large commercial jobs in the pueblo area  the relatively strong construction market during the first half of coupled with favorable weather conditions during the first quarter of the year as compared to the quarter and concrete price increases 
although the housing market slowed midyear  continued work on the three large industrial jobs allowed us to increase sales volume for despite volume declines in denver and colorado springs for the year 
the purchase of asci on june  also helped offset some of the effect of the slowing market in colorado springs 
concrete pricing improved during although the increases were largely instituted to offset increased cement and fuel cost 
aggregates sales improved in combination with the concrete volume 
sales of the supplies division declined in a slower  more price competitive market 
operating income is highly sensitive to sales volume in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment 
this segment has also historically required a sizable investment in capital assets resulting in a significant portion of its costs being relatively fixed in nature 
operating income as a percent of sales  therefore  generally increases and decreases at a higher rate but in tandem with sales changes 
operating income for was  as compared to the operating profit of  cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased from in to in despite the insurance recovery of  from the flood damage claims 
as noted above  due to the increased competitive pricing caused by the decline in construction activity  sales prices were not able to be fully passed on to customers to offset the higher costs 
in addition  depreciation expense rose approximately  in compared to due to the high capital spending in recent years and the amortization of intangibles related to the asci acquisition 
the segment also sold numerous assets during which resulted in gains of  compared to the small loss of  incurred during operating income for was  compared to the results of  cost of sales as a percentage of sales declined during compared to the improvement was the result of some price increases and delivery efficiencies on the large industrial jobs  lower workers compensation claims  and the relatively fixed nature of some costs that did not increase proportionately with sales 
selling and administrative costs increased but declined as a percentage of sales due to the fixed nature of some of the costs 
partially offsetting these improvements were the  decrease in the gain on dispositions of property and equipment from the level in this segment and the effect of flooding at our two arkansas river operations in july and a second flood at our pueblo east pit in august 
both were the result of heavy rains in the area 
all expenses incurred to repair the damage and resume production have been recognized in cost of sales 
both quarries were back in operation during although some measures to mitigate future flood losses were not completed until management estimates that the effect of the flooding added over  in expenses at the two aggregate operations in the company filed insurance claims and settled those claims for  during no recovery had been anticipated or recorded in the results of operations 
as expected the reduced profit level of resulted in lower operating income as a percent of sales and lower return on assets from the level 
the return on assets for increased as a result of the higher sales and improved profit margins partially offset by the investment related to the asci acquisition and a higher level of receivables 
door segment sales in the door segment increased  or during over the level as demand remained strong and sales of electronic access systems increased 
sales are also affected by the timing of shipments as contractors may accelerate or delay shipments depending on the progress of their projects 
backlog was reduced over the course of but remains at a strong level 
sales in the door segment for increased  or over primarily due to the acquisition of cssl at the beginning of the year 
operating income was  during compared to  during due principally to the increase in sales volume 
operating income increased  during over the  level achieved during due to the increased sales volume 
margins were slightly narrower due to expenses associated with the assimilation of the cssl acquisition 
operating income as a percentage of sales for improved as the electronic access products were assimilated into more projects and the company was able to lever their electronics capability to increase sales and pricing 
operating income as a percentage of sales for declined slightly from the level due to the narrower margins in the newly acquired cssl electronic access business 
the return on assets during declined slightly from the level primarily due to the acquisition of the colorado springs facility during which increased the asset base of the segment 
the return on assets for declined from the level partly due to the narrower margins noted above but also because of an increase in the segment assets during chiefly due to higher receivables and inventories at year end 
hvac industry group the table below presents a summary of operating information for the two reportable segments within the hvac industry group for the fiscal years  and amounts in thousands 
heating and cooling evaporative cooling revenues from external customers segment operating loss operating loss as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets heating and cooling segment sales in the heating and cooling segment improved to  an increase of  or from the  in furnace volume increased a modest while the fan coil line added over  in sales during profit margins  however  were lower compared to the reduced margins were due to significantly higher plant overhead costs  higher than expected material costs and more generous sales incentive plans offered to key furnace customers 
factory overhead expenses were significantly higher in part due to an increase in employee healthcare costs and workers compensation claims 
factory indirect payroll costs were higher due to additional personnel hired to accommodate the increased fan coil volume 
expenses associated with a business systems conversion and the implementation of a product configurator program for the fan coil line reduced the operating results 
selling expenses increased by almost of sales due to volume incentives and other marketing expenses related to programs offered to major furnace customers 
sales in the heating and cooling segment in increased to  an increase of  or  from the amount of  sales of both furnaces and fan coils rose during the year 
furnace volume increased due to the recapture of all of the business of a large national home center account 
the fan coil sales increase is attributable to the company s restructuring of its sales representative network and the addition of internal sales and support staff 
operating results fell to a loss of  from the  profit reported for as noted above  the addition of personnel in anticipation of continued growth in fan coil sales  increased factory costs and pricing pressures primarily in the form of enhanced sales incentive programs all combined to diminish profit margins 
higher insurance premiums and legal costs associated with product liability claims contributed to the loss in the company also continued to be affected by raw material price increases 
fan coil pricing is generally determined and fixed at the time the contract is awarded 
the period of time from the awarding of a contract to the production and delivery of the product can vary 
commodity price increases during the intervening period will significantly impact the margins realized 
operating income declined from  for to  during the decline was the result of numerous factors  all reducing income 
pricing decisions made to retain and expand our furnace business with a national home center account reduced our selling price and the related margin 
a substantial price increase in copper prices coupled with increases in aluminum and steel narrowed margins for both product lines 
furnace prices are established at the beginning of the season 
as noted above  fan coil pricing is generally determined and fixed at the time the contract is awarded 
the period of time from the awarding of a contract to the production and delivery of the product can vary 
during this intervening period in  we experienced significant increases in copper prices 
the addition of sales  engineering and support staff and the opening of a sales and service center in oklahoma city made to increase fan coil sales increased selling and administrative expenses 
expenditures for computer system upgrades and product configuration software and the cost of general business consultants engaged to review all aspects of the business and organization also increased selling and administrative costs 
operating results as a percent of sales and the return on assets were both negative for the year due to the loss reported for operating income as a percent of sales and the return on assets were both much lower in compared to due to the lower operating income 
evaporative cooling segment sales in the evaporative cooling segment increased slightly to  up  or over the amount of  the increase was due to modest sales price gains as unit sales were essentially equal to the level 
sales of a custom manufactured electrical distribution box declined partially offsetting the price gains on coolers 
contribution margins declined substantially due to higher material costs as well as higher employee benefit expenses 
workers compensation claims  self insured healthcare claims and maintenance costs were all higher in sales during in the evaporative cooling segment improved to  an increase of  or  over the amount of  unit volume increased due to an increase in industrial cooling units in the latter part of operating results slipped from a profit of  in to a loss of  in as noted above  the increased costs combined with aggressive competition that limited sales price increases  were the causes for the decline 
operating results for improved from a loss of  in to a profit of  in the overall increased sales volume combined with a shift to the larger industrial units resulted in improved margins 
reduced workers compensation claims also aided the results 
operating results as a percent of sales and the return on assets were both negative for due to the loss noted above 
operating results as a percent of sales and the return on assets were both improved in compared to as a result of the modest amount of operating income in compared to the loss incurred during critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 issued by the securities and exchange commission  requires all registrants  including the company  to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies and methods 
intangibles in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized as a charge to earnings 
the company annually assesses goodwill for potential impairment as of the last day of its fiscal year 
in addition  to the extent that events occur  either involving the relevant company subsidiaries or in their industries  the company revisits its assessment of the recorded goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred and should be immediately recognized 
this assessment requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  discount rates  growth rates and costs 
in addition  the terms of recent industry transactions mergers are considered 
no impairment was indicated in the current year 
if the assessment had indicated that the carrying value of goodwill was impaired  an impairment charge would have been recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its fair value 
management believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable  however  changes in the aforementioned assumptions and estimates  as well as the effects of unknown future events or circumstances could materially affect the estimated fair value 
liabilities the company purchases insurance coverage for workers compensation  general product and automobile liability  retaining certain levels of risk self insured portion 
provision for workers compensation claims is estimated with the assistance of an independent expert who applies actuarial methodology to information provided by the company s independent claims administrator 
provision for automobile claims is estimated based upon information provided by the company s independent claims administrator and the company s own experience 
with regard to product liability  provisions for both claims and unasserted claims that would be covered under the self insured portion of the policies are recorded in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and are reviewed at least annually for revisions in estimates 
the company records a reserve for future reclamation work to be performed at its various aggregate operations based upon an estimate of the total expense that will be incurred to reclaim the disturbed areas 
actual reclamation costs are charged against the reserve 
the adequacy of the recorded reserve is assessed annually 
the assessment may be done more frequently if events or circumstances arise that may indicate a change in estimated costs  recoverable material or the period of mining activity 
the company periodically engages an independent professional to assist in reevaluating the estimates of both the quantities of recoverable material and the cost of reclamation 
this analysis requires the independent professional and us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the mining plans  homogeneity of the deposits  third party costs to perform work  method of reclamation to be used  etc 
management believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the reserve are reasonable  however  changes in the aforementioned assumptions and estimates  as well as the effects of unknown future events or circumstances  including legislative requirements  could materially affect estimated costs  the quantities of recoverable material or the period of mining 
depletion of rock and sand deposits and amortization of deferred development costs are computed by the units of production method based upon estimated recoverable quantities of rock and sand 
sales the company recognizes revenue as products are shipped to customers 
sales are recorded net of estimates of applicable provisions for discounts  volume incentives  returns and allowances based upon current program terms and historical experience 
at the time of revenue recognition  the company also provides an estimate of potential bad debt and warranty expense as well as an amount anticipated to be granted to customers under cooperative advertising programs based upon current program terms and historical experience

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks related to commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage interest rate risk  the company has  from time to time  entered into interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges 
these swaps are authorized by the company s policies and procedures 
the company does not use swaps or hedging instruments for trading purposes  and is not a party to any transaction involving leveraged derivatives 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement swap agreement covering the period december  through december  in order to minimize the adverse impact of the floating interest rate characteristic of some of the company s term loan borrowings 
the company s effective interest rate on the portion of the term loan covered by the swap agreement was during cash payments or receipts associated with this agreement are reflected in interest expense 
the fixed rate under the swap agreement was less than the floating rate on the term loan during but exceeded the floating rate during the effect on operations was to increase net income by  for while reducing net income by  for during the swap period  the fair value of the swap agreement was recorded on the balance sheet with subsequent changes recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity
