overview description of company we are a biotechnology company engaged in the development of therapeutic and diagnostic products primarily for disorders in the central nervous system  or cns 
our clinical and preclinical product candidate pipeline is based on three proprietary technology platforms regenerative therapeutics program  primarily focused on nerve repair and restoring movement and sensory function in patients who have had a significant loss of cns function resulting from traumas or degenerative diseases  such as spinal cord injury  or sci  stroke and optic nerve injury utilizing technology referred to as axon regeneration  molecular imaging program focused on the diagnosis of i parkinsonian syndromes  or ps  including parkinson s disease  or pd  ii attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  or adhd  and iii dementia with lewy bodies  or dlb  and neurodegenerative disease program focused on treating the symptoms of pd and slowing or stopping the progression of pd 
at december   we were considered a development stage enterprise as defined in statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises 
as of december   we have experienced total net losses since inception of approximately  and stockholders deficit of approximately  for the foreseeable future  we expect to experience continuing operating losses and negative cash flows from operations as our management executes our current business plan 
the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available at december  will not provide sufficient working capital to meet our anticipated expenditures for the next twelve months 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available at december   combined with the  available to us under a convertible promissory note purchase agreement  referred to as the march amended purchase agreement  entered into by us on march  described below with robert gipson  our former director  thomas gipson  and arthur koenig  our significant stockholders  highbridge international  llc  or highbridge  and ingalls snyder value partners lp  or isvp  collectively referred to as the purchasers  and our ability to control certain costs  including those related to clinical trial programs  preclinical activities  and certain general and administrative expenses will enable us to meet our anticipated cash expenditures through may in order to continue as a going concern  we will therefore need to raise additional capital through one or more of the following a debt financing or equity offering  or a collaboration  merger  acquisition or other transaction with one or more pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies 
we are currently engaged in fundraising efforts 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our fundraising efforts or that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we also cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain additional credit from  or effect additional sales of debt or equity securities to the purchasers described below 
if we are unable to raise additional or sufficient capital  we will need to cease operations or reduce  cease or delay one or more of our research or development programs  adjust our current business plan and may not be able to continue as a going concern 
if we violate a debt covenant or default under the march amended purchase agreement  we may need to cease operations or reduce  cease or delay one or more 
table of contents of our research or development programs  adjust our current business plan and may not be able to continue as a going concern 
in connection with the common stock financing completed by us in march  or the march financing  we agreed with the purchasers in such financing  including robert gipson  thomas gipson  and arthur koenig  or the march investors  that  subject to certain exceptions  we would not issue any shares of our common stock at a per share price less than without the prior consent of the march investors holding at least a majority of the shares issued in the march financing 
on march   the closing price of our common stock was 
the failure to receive the requisite waiver or consent of the march investors could have the effect of delaying or preventing the consummation of a financing by us should the price per share in such financing be set at less than 
our ability to continue to advance our clinical programs  including the development of cethrin and the altropane molecular imaging agent  and our preclinical programs will be affected by the availability of financial resources to fund each program 
financial considerations may cause us to modify planned development activities for one or more of our programs  and we may decide to suspend development of one or more programs until we are able to secure additional working capital 
if we are not able to raise additional capital  we will not have sufficient funds to complete the clinical trial programs for cethrin or the altropane molecular imaging agent 
we continually evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in  businesses  technologies and products that are complementary to our nerve repair program 
the consideration paid in connection with an acquisition also affects our financial results 
if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any such acquisition or acquisitions 
to the extent we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock  including options or other rights  existing stockholders may be diluted 
in addition  acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt  large one time write offs and restructuring charges 
acquisitions may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests  which could result in future impairment charges 
to the extent that we use common stock for all or a portion of the consideration to be paid for future acquisitions  our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 
in order to effect an acquisition  we may need additional financing 
we cannot be certain that any such financing will be available on terms favorable or acceptable to us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity related or debt securities  these securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stockholders  who would then experience dilution 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify or successfully complete any acquisitions 
march amended purchase agreement in march  we entered into a convertible promissory note purchase agreement  or the march purchase agreement  with robert gipson  thomas gipson and arthur koenig  referred to as the purchasers and also the march note holders  pursuant to which we could borrow up to  from the march note holders prior to december  in march  we issued convertible promissory notes to the march note holders in the aggregate principal amount of  pursuant to the march purchase agreement 
certain of the material terms of the convertible promissory notes are described below 
in may  we amended and restated the march purchase agreement  or the may amended purchase agreement  to i eliminate the requirement for the march note holders to make further advances under the march purchase agreement and ii add highbridge as a purchaser 
in may  we issued a convertible promissory note  or the highbridge note  to highbridge in the aggregate principal amount of  pursuant to the may amended purchase agreement 
in august  we amended and restated the may amended purchase agreement  or the august amended purchase agreement  to i increase the amount we could borrow by  to  and ii add isvp as a purchaser 
in august  we issued a convertible promissory note  or the 
table of contents isvp note  to isvp in the aggregate principal amount of  pursuant to the august amended purchase agreement 
in march  we amended and restated the august amended purchase agreement  or the march amended purchase agreement  to i increase the amount we could borrow by  to  and ii provide that we may incur up to an additional  of indebtedness from the purchasers upon the same terms and conditions pursuant to the march amended purchase agreement 
in march  we issued a convertible promissory note  or the robert gipson note  to robert gipson in the aggregate principal amount of  pursuant to the march amended purchase agreement 
the amounts borrowed by us under the march amended purchase agreement bear interest at the rate of per annum and may be converted  at the option of the purchasers into i shares of our common stock at a conversion price per share of  ii the right to receive future payments related to our molecular imaging products including altropane and fluoratec in amounts equal to of our pre commercial revenue related to such products plus of future net sales of such products for each  of outstanding principal and interest that a purchaser elects to convert into future payments  or iii a combination of i and ii 
any outstanding notes that are not converted into our common stock or into the right to receive future payments will become due and payable by the earlier of december  or the date on which a purchaser declares an event of default as defined in the march amended purchase agreement 
however  each purchaser is prohibited from effecting a conversion if at the time of such conversion the common stock issuable to such purchaser  when taken together with all shares of common stock then held or otherwise beneficially owned by a purchaser exceeds  or for highbridge and isvp  of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock immediately prior to such conversion unless and until our stockholders approve the conversion of all of the shares of common stock issuable thereunder 
we are subject to certain debt covenants pursuant to the march amended purchase agreement

product development regenerative therapeutics program nerve repair our nerve repair program is focused on restoring movement and sensory function in patients who have had significant loss of cns function resulting from traumas or degenerative diseases such as sci  stroke and optic nerve injury 
our efforts are aimed at the use of proprietary regenerative drugs and or methods to induce nerve fibers called axons to regenerate and form new connections that restore lost abilities 
we have acquired the rights to technologies aimed at two key and complementary pathways involved in nerve repair the pro regenerative and anti regenerative pathways 
we believe the pro regenerative approach activates pathways that stimulate axon regeneration and the anti regenerative approach deactivates pathways that inhibit axon regeneration 
we also support sponsored research that may open new avenues for exploring combination therapies 
we believe these agreements extend our existing capabilities in nerve repair by potentially providing multiple avenues for intervention in functional cns recovery 
licensing the rights to the technologies of two complementary approaches for axon regeneration is part of our strategy to build a broad platform of technology and intellectual property for the development of nerve repair therapeutics 
we believe that the assembly of broad intellectual property and technology in nerve repair will create competitive advantages 
the simultaneous implementation of the sponsored research programs may open avenues for exploring combination therapies for cns disorders that are difficult to treat 
the research also provides an opportunity to continue to enrich the application of the technologies and our intellectual property portfolio 

table of contents cethrin contains a proprietary protein that inactivates a key enzyme called rho that prevents axon regeneration 
rho potentially plays an important role in a wide range of cns indications  including acute sci  optic nerve injury and glaucoma 
cethrin is currently being investigated to facilitate the re growth of axons during the critical period immediately after a major injury to the spinal cord 
following an sci  approximately two thirds of patients undergo decompression stabilization surgery 
during surgery  cethrin is delivered to the injured region of the spinal cord using a single application with a fibrin sealant as a carrier 
in january  enrollment ended in our open label  non placebo controlled  dose escalating phase i iia trial in subjects with acute sci 
a total of subjects was enrolled at sites in the united states and canada 
the trial design includes a number of post treatment evaluations of the subjects for safety and efficacy for up to one year after treatment 
the efficacy measurements assess changes in subjects sensory and motor functions  as well as overall recovery as measured by the american spinal injury association  or asia  impairment scale 
the asia impairment scale is used to score subjects within five categories from a to e  with a being complete impairment with no sensory or motor function below the site of injury and e being normal 
grades b through e designate increasing levels of motor and sensory function 
the subjects in the cethrin phase i iia trial suffered a complete thoracic or cervical sci and were thus classified as an a on the asia impairment scale at the time of enrollment in the trial 
the trial assessed dose levels of cethrin mg  mg  mg  mg and mg 
each authorized dose level was first given to thoracic sci subjects and then  following review by the independent data safety monitoring board  or dsmb  the dose level was extended to cervical subjects 
to date  the safety and tolerability data for each of the five dose levels have indicated that cethrin appears to be safe and well tolerated 
there have been no serious adverse events related to cethrin as determined by the investigators and dsmb 
there were two deaths of subjects enrolled in the trial 
the dsmb and the clinical investigators attributed the two deaths to causes related to the subjects initial sci  other injuries  or preexisting conditions and not related to cethrin 
the month interim data on the first subjects treated with doses up to mg indicated that of of the cethrin treated subjects improved from asia a to asia b or better 
this is more than greater than the conversion rate for non cethrin treated subjects in a similarly designed study burns  j 
neurotrauma  
when cervical subjects treated with cethrin were analyzed separately  of of the subjects with cervical injuries improved from asia a to asia b or better 
this is almost greater than the full patient group treated with only the standard of care reported in the publication above 
moreover  of of the cethrin treated subjects overall and of of subjects with cervical injuries improved over the six months to asia c or better 
in subjects with cervical injuries  the interim efficacy data also suggest that the conversion rate was dose dependent 
we have met with the food and drug administration  or fda  health canada and the european medicines agency  or emea  to review the phase i iia results and our cethrin clinical development plan 
based on discussions to date with the regulatory authorities and our expert advisors  we are planning to initiate a double blind  randomized  placebo controlled  multi center  phase iib trial in up to subjects with acute cervical sci at up to sites in the united states  canada  europe and other selected countries in the second half of we are also exploring the use of other nerve repair drug candidates in a variety of cns conditions such as sci  stroke  and optic nerve injury 
we initiated a series of comparative studies in which the abilities of inosine  oncomodulin and other compounds will be tested in parallel in a series of animal models of cns disorders to assess their potential to enhance nerve repair 
if successful  these studies may enable the most promising candidates and indications to be taken forward in development 
regenerative therapeutics program bone repair we are evaluating our rho inhibitors in vitro and in animal models to asses their ability to stimulate cells to regenerate bone 

table of contents molecular imaging program the altropane molecular imaging agent is being developed for the differential diagnosis of ps  including pd  and non ps in patients with tremor 
in july  our collaborators completed enrollment in a study that optimized altropane s image acquisition protocol which we believe will enhance altropane s commercial use 
after a series of discussions with the fda and our expert advisors  the poet program was designed as a two part phase iii program using the optimized altropane image acquisition protocol 
the first part of the program was initiated in december in a multi center clinical study in subjects to acquire a set of altropane images 
this set of images will be used to train the expert readers as is the customary process for clinical trials of molecular imaging agents 
the second part involves two concurrent  replicate  multi center phase iii trials 
these two concurrent trials  the final design of which is under discussion with the fda  will be initiated once final agreement on the design of the two trials is reached with the fda 
we are looking to engage a strategic partner for our molecular imaging program for the completion of the phase iii clinical program and launch and commercialization of altropane 
we believe that engaging a partner is likely to be the most effective means to maximize the value of the program 
we also believe that the expansion of the program into other indications such as dlb and other countries including those in europe could increase the value of the program for the partner and us 
in addition to altropane  we are developing a second generation technetium based molecular imaging agent for the diagnosis of pd  adhd and dlb 
in  we devised a new radiolabeling procedure as a prelude to obtaining definitive images in non human primates 
we believe the potential use of our technetium based molecular imaging agents could be strategic in our partnering efforts for our molecular imaging program 
neurodegenerative disease program we are developing a dat blocker for the treatment of the symptoms of pd and slowing or stopping the progression of pd 
we have identified several promising lead compounds 
several of these lead compounds have been shown in primate studies to alleviate the symptoms of pd 
in some cases  efficacy results with our dat blocker were comparable to that of a standard dopamine agonist 
dopamine agonists are routinely used to treat the symptoms of pd both as mono therapy agents and in conjunction with the most common treatment  levodopa 
we have shown that our lead compounds bind to the dat in vitro at low concentrations and are effective in vitro at blocking dat re uptake also at low concentrations 
our lead compounds have also been shown to enter the brain after oral dosing in rodents and to alleviate the symptoms of pd in non human primates 
we are seeking a partner to advance our neurodegenerative disease program into clinical trials 
sales and marketing and government regulation to date  we have not marketed  distributed or sold any products and  with the exception of altropane and cethrin  all of our other product candidates are in preclinical development 
our product candidates must undergo a rigorous regulatory approval process which includes extensive preclinical and clinical testing to demonstrate safety and efficacy before any resulting product can be marketed 
the fda has stringent standards with which we must comply before we can test our product candidates in humans or make them commercially available 
preclinical testing and clinical trials are lengthy and expensive and the historical rate of failure for product candidates is high 
clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment which is a function of many factors 
delays and difficulties in completing patient enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times 
the foregoing uncertainties and risks limit our ability to estimate the timing and amount of future costs that will be required to complete the clinical development of each program 
in addition  we are unable to estimate when material net cash inflows are expected to commence as a result of the successful completion of one or more of our programs 

table of contents research and development following is information on the direct research and development costs incurred on our principal scientific technology programs currently under development 
these amounts do not include research and development employee and related overhead costs which total approximately  on a cumulative basis 
for the three for the year from inception months ended ended october  to program december  december  december  regenerative therapeutics molecular imaging neurodegenerative disease estimating costs and time to complete development of a specific program or technology is difficult due to the uncertainties of the development process and the requirements of the fda which could require additional clinical trials or other development and testing 
results of any testing could lead to a decision to change or terminate development of a technology  in which case estimated future costs could change substantially 
in the event we were to enter into a licensing or other collaborative agreement with a corporate partner involving sharing or funding by such corporate partner of development costs  the estimated development costs incurred by us could be substantially less than estimated 
additionally  research and development costs are extremely difficult to estimate for early stage technologies due to the fact that there are generally less comprehensive data available for such technologies to determine the development activities that would be required prior to the filing of a new drug application  or nda 
as a result  we cannot reasonably estimate the cost and the date of completion for any technology that is not at least in phase iii clinical development due to the uncertainty regarding the number of required trials  the size of such trials and the duration of development 
even in phase iii clinical development  estimating the cost and the filing date for an nda can be challenging due to the uncertainty regarding the number and size of the required phase iii trials 
we are currently analyzing what additional expenditures may be required to complete the phase iii clinical trial program for altropane for the diagnosis of ps and cannot reasonably estimate the cost of this phase iii clinical trial program at this time 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to marketable securities  research contracts  the fair value and classification of equity instruments  our lease accrual and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
marketable securities our marketable securities consist exclusively of investments in united states agency bonds and corporate debt obligations 
these marketable securities are adjusted to fair value on the consolidated balance sheet through other comprehensive income 
if a decline in the fair value of a security is considered to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to a new cost basis and the unrealized loss is removed from accumulated other comprehensive loss and recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary based on factors such as the significance of the decline  the duration of time for which the decline has been in existence and our ability and intent to hold the security to maturity 
to date  we have not recorded any other than temporary impairments related to our marketable securities 
these marketable securities are classified as current assets because they are highly liquid and are available  as required  to meet working capital and other operating requirements 

table of contents research contracts we regularly enter into contracts with third parties to perform research and development activities on our behalf in connection with our scientific technologies 
costs incurred under these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract or based on actual enrollment levels which we believe corresponds to the manner in which the work is performed 
clinical trial  contract services and other outside costs require that we make estimates of the costs incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at period end as the third party service periods and billing terms do not always coincide with our period end 
we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs  services performed for the period  past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract  where applicable 
fair value and classification of equity instruments historically  we have issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in connection with our debt and equity financings 
we record each of the securities issued on a relative fair value basis up to the amount of the proceeds received 
we estimate the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model is dependent on a number of variables and estimates including interest rates  dividend yield  volatility and the expected term of the warrants 
our estimates are based on market interest rates at the date of issuance  our past history for declaring dividends  our estimated stock price volatility and the contractual term of the warrants 
the value ascribed to the warrants in connection with debt offerings is considered a cost of capital and amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt 
we have  at certain times  issued preferred stock and notes  which were convertible into common stock at a discount from the common stock market price at the date of issuance 
the amount of the discount associated with such conversion rights represents an incremental yield  or beneficial conversion feature that is recorded when the consideration allocated to the convertible security  divided by the number of common shares into which the security converts  is below the fair value of the common stock at the date of issuance of the convertible instrument 
a beneficial conversion feature associated with the preferred stock is recognized as a return to the preferred stockholders and represents a non cash charge in the determination of net loss attributable to common stockholders 
the beneficial conversion feature is recognized in full immediately if there is no redemption date for the preferred stock  or over the period of issuance through the redemption date  if applicable 
a beneficial conversion feature associated with debentures  notes or other debt instruments is recognized as discount to the debt and is amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest method over the remaining term of the debt instrument 
lease accrual we are required to make significant judgments and assumptions when estimating the liability for our net ongoing obligations under our amended lease agreement relating to our former executive offices located in boston  massachusetts 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we use a discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the amount of the liability 
we applied a discount rate of representing our best estimate of our credit adjusted risk free rate 
the discounted cash flow analysis is based on management s assumptions and estimates of our ongoing lease obligations  and income from sublease rentals  including estimates of sublease timing and sublease rental terms 
it is possible that our estimates and assumptions will change in the future  resulting in additional adjustments to the amount of the estimated liability  and the effect of any adjustments could be material 
we review our assumptions and judgments related to the lease amendment on at least a quarterly basis  until the outcome is finalized  and make whatever modifications we believe are necessary  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changes in circumstances 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to measure compensation cost for all share based awards at fair value on grant 
table of contents date and recognize it as expense over the requisite service period or expected performance period of the award 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 or apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas r and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented in this form k have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
under sfas r  we estimate the fair value of stock based awards using the black scholes valuation model on the grant date 
the black scholes valuation model requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates concerning the expected term of the awards  the rate of return of risk free investments  our stock price volatility  and our anticipated dividends 
if any of our estimates or assumptions prove incorrect  our results could be materially affected 
results of operations year ended december  and our net loss and net loss attributable to common stockholders was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  net loss attributable to common stockholders totaled per share during as compared with per share during the decrease in net loss in was primarily due to lower research and development expenses 
the decrease in net loss attributable to common stockholders on a per share basis in was primarily due to a decrease in operating costs and an increase in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately  shares in  which was primarily the result of the conversion of notes payable into common stock in june research and development expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the decrease in was primarily attributable to our cethrin license for which we incurred expense of  in and lower costs associated with our molecular imaging program of approximately  primarily associated with decreased altropane clinical costs 
the decrease was partially offset by i higher costs of approximately  related to our nerve repair program  primarily related to cethrin clinical costs including our phase i iia trial and preparations for our phase ii trial and ii higher compensation and related costs of approximately  primarily related to increased headcount offset by lower stock based compensation expense 
we currently anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase over the next twelve months although there may be significant fluctuations on a quarterly basis 
this expected increase is primarily related to higher cethrin and altropane clinical costs 
our current working capital constraints may limit our planned expenditures 
general and administrative expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily related to i higher compensation and related costs of approximately  primarily related to increased headcount  ii higher commercialization and communication costs of approximately  iii higher directors fees of approximately  due to the addition of three new board members and iv higher patent and related costs of approximately  primarily related to our nerve repair program 
the increase was partially offset by lower collaboration and fundraising costs of approximately  primarily related to our cethrin license signed in we currently anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase over the next twelve months although there may be significant fluctuations on a quarterly basis 
this expected increase is primarily related to costs associated with our commercialization and communication efforts primarily related to our cethrin and altropane molecular imaging agent program and costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of interest expense totaled  during the year ended december  as compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in the period was attributable to the issuance of 
table of contents  in convertible promissory notes in that bear interest at the rate of per annum and the related non cash interest expense of approximately  related to the beneficial conversion features 
the increase in the period was partially offset by the gain recorded related to the forgiveness of interest of approximately  attributable to  in promissory notes issued in march the notes issued in march eliminated all outstanding principal and accrued interest due under notes previously issued 
in june  the  in promissory notes was converted into  shares of common stock 
investment income was  during the year ended december  as compared with investment income of  during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances in than in at december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately  for which a full valuation allowance has been established 
as a result of our concentrated efforts on research and development  we have a history of incurring net operating losses  or nol  and expect to incur additional net operating losses for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the future benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be realized and  therefore  we have provided a full valuation allowance for these assets 
in the event we achieve profitability  these deferred tax assets may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and expense  subject to limitations that may occur from ownership changes under provisions of the internal revenue code 
in and  we experienced a change in ownership as defined by section of the internal revenue code 
in general  an ownership change  as defined by section  results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
since our formation  we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions which  combined with stockholders subsequent disposition of those shares  has resulted in two changes of control  as defined by section as a result of the most recent ownership change  utilization of our nols is subject to an annual limitation under section determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate resulting in an annual limitation amount of approximately  any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years  and the amount of the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be subject to adjustment if the fair value of our net assets are determined to be below or in excess of the tax basis of such assets at the time of the ownership change  and such unrealized loss or gain is recognized during the five year period after the ownership change 
federal research and development tax credits were also impaired by the ownership change and were reduced accordingly 
year ended december  and our net loss was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  our net loss attributable to common stockholders was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  net loss attributable to common stockholders totaled per share during as compared with per share during the increase in net loss in was primarily due to higher research and development expenses 
the increase in net loss attributable to common stockholders on a per share basis in was primarily due to an increase in operating costs offset by an increase in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately  shares in  which was primarily the result of the private placements of common stock completed in march and september research and development expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily attributable to our cethrin license for which we incurred expense of  in related to the nerve repair program  of which  was accrued at december   higher costs associated with our molecular imaging program of approximately  primarily associated with clinical trial costs for poet and assembly and preparation of our safety and clinical databases for altropane  and higher compensation and related costs of approximately  primarily related to increased stock based compensation in connection with the adoption of sfas r 

table of contents general and administrative expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily related to higher compensation and related costs of approximately  primarily related to increased stock based compensation expense in connection with the adoption of sfas r in and increased headcount  higher commercialization and communication costs of approximately  and higher costs of approximately  related to our collaboration  merger  acquisition and fundraising efforts 
the increase was partially offset by the absence of approximately  in costs incurred related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in interest expense totaled  during the year ended december  as compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in the period is attributable to the increase in notes payable during issued to robert gipson and thomas gipson offset by non cash interest expense of approximately  incurred in february when we agreed to lower the exercise price of a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock held by isvp in return for its immediate exercise in cash 
investment income was  during the year ended december  as compared with investment income of  during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower than average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances in offset by higher interest rates during the period 
accrual of preferred stock dividends was during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  in december  we issued shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock  or series e stock  with a purchase price of  per share of series e stock which initially yielded a cumulative dividend of per annum with a potential increase to in june in february  we entered into agreements with the holders of series e stock  or the holders  whereby the holders agreed to convert their series e stock into common stock 
we agreed to pay a dividend of for each share of series e stock converted into common stock by the holders and to lower the exercise price of the warrants held by the holders from to 
we recorded a charge of  to net loss attributable to common stockholders under the black scholes pricing model in connection with the re pricing of the warrants 
we recorded a charge of  to net loss attributable to common stockholders during the year ended related to the accrual of preferred stock dividends 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used for operating activities  primarily related to our net loss  totaled  in as compared to  in the increase in is primarily related to the  due under our cethrin license in and paid in march net cash used for investing activities totaled  in as compared to cash provided by investing activities of  in the increase in is primarily related to the increase in financing proceeds in which were subsequently used to purchase marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled  in as compared to  in the increase in primarily reflects the increase in convertible notes payable issued in to date  we have dedicated most of our financial resources to the research and development of our product candidates  general and administrative expenses and costs related to obtaining and protecting patents

at december   we had available cash and cash equivalents of approximately  and marketable securities of approximately  in march  we obtained additional available funding of  under the march amended purchase agreement 
as of december   we have experienced total net losses since inception of approximately  and stockholders deficit of approximately  for the foreseeable future  we expect to experience continuing operating losses and negative cash flows from operations as our management executes our current business plan 
the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available at december  will not provide sufficient working capital to meet our anticipated expenditures for the next twelve months 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available at december   combined with the  available to us under the march amended purchase agreement and our ability to control certain costs  including those related to clinical trial programs  preclinical activities  and certain general and administrative expenses will enable us to meet our anticipated cash expenditures through may in order to continue as a going concern  we will therefore need to raise additional capital through one or more of the following a debt financing or equity offering  or a collaboration  merger  acquisition or other transaction with one or more pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies 
we are currently engaged in fundraising efforts 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our fundraising efforts or that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we also cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain additional credit from  or effect additional sales of debt or equity securities to the purchasers 
if we are unable to raise additional or sufficient capital  we will need to cease operations or reduce  cease or delay one or more of our research or development programs  adjust our current business plan and may not be able to continue as a going concern

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we generally maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents  and short term and long term marketable securities in a variety of securities which can include commercial paper  certificates of deposit  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
the fair value of these available for sale securities are subject to changes in market interest rates and may fall in value if market interest rates increase 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help insure liquidity 
we have implemented policies regarding the amount and credit ratings of investments 
due to the conservative nature of these policies  we do not believe we have material exposure due to market risk 
we may not have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore our future operating results or cash flows could be affected if we are required to sell investments during a period in which increases in market interest rates have adversely affected the value of our securities portfolio 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not earnings or cash flows 
we do not have an obligation to prepay any fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  therefore  interest rate risk and changes in the fair market value of fixed rate debt should not have a significant impact on earnings or cash flows until such debt is refinanced  if necessary 
the terms related to our fixed rate debt are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
we did not have any variable rate debt outstanding during the fiscal year ended december
