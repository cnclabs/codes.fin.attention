item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  the notes to those financial statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this document 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this document contain forward looking statements that reflect plans  estimates  intentions  expectations and beliefs 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
see note regarding forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those set forth in the risk factors in item a and contained elsewhere in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates our estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  asset impairments  inventory valuation  warranty reserves and other assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition although we have shipped products and recorded contract revenues  our operations have not yet reached a level that would qualify us to emerge from the development stage 
therefore we continue to be accounted for as a development stage company under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises 
product sales we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
generally  revenue is recognized on transfer of title  typically when products are shipped and all related costs are estimable 
for sales to distributors  we make an adjustment to defer revenue until products are subsequently sold by distributors to their customers 
government contract revenue recognized on the percentage of completion method we recognize contract revenues using the percentage of completion method  based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
changes to total estimated contract costs or losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed are classified as current assets  and included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our balance sheets 
amounts billed to clients in excess of revenues recognized to date are classified as current liabilities under advance billings on contracts 
changes in project performance and conditions  estimated profitability  and final contract settlements may result in future revisions to construction contract costs and revenue 
all of our research and development contracts are subject to cost review by the respective agencies 
our reported results from these contracts could change adversely as a result of these reviews 
loss on contract commitments each quarter  we perform an evaluation of expected costs to complete our in progress contracts that we account for using the percentage of completion method 
in the event that the total expected costs to complete a contract exceed the expected total contract revenue  we immediately record a loss on the contract to the extent that the expected loss exceeds the expected revenue from the contract 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
for the years ended december   and  reserves were recorded to fully offset the value of our inventory 
these impairment charges were made due to the uncertainty of realizing any future value from the inventory due to the lack of substantial revenues to date from our inverter product line 
materials used in the development of the smart energy flywheel and our other development efforts are considered research and development materials  and are expensed as incurred in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
materials purchased for the production of flywheels are expected to be capitalized as part of our planned frequency regulation facilities and have been classified as construction in progress and are included in property and equipment on our balance sheet 
patent costs we capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents where we believe that the future economic benefit of the patent will be increased 
we monitor the legal costs incurred and the anticipated outcome of the legal action and  if changes in the anticipated outcome occur  capitalized costs will be adjusted in the period the change is determined 
patent costs are amortized over the remaining life of the patents 
we own intellectual property in the form of patents on our flywheel vacuum system  our heat pipe cooling systems  dc output paralleling  metal hub  low loss motor  co mingled rims and earthquake tolerant bearings on our flywheel products  and anti islanding software  drawings  source code  and production know how on our inverter products  and expect to obtain other patents during and beyond 
in december  we recorded impairment charges to write down our capitalized patent costs to zero due to the lack of substantial revenues to date and the uncertainty of realizing any future value from these patents  accordingly  all costs incurred during  and related to the development of intellectual property have been expensed as incurred 
warranty reserves the solar inverters we have sold carry warranties that require us to repair or replace defective products returned to us during the applicable warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs based on actual historical return rates  anticipated return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce our current valuation allowance which could materially impact our tax provision 
we classify interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
fixed assets fixed assets are defined as tangible items with unit costs exceeding our capitalization threshold that are used in the operation of the business  are not intended for resale and which have a useful life of one year or more 
the cost of fixed assets is defined as the purchase price of the item  as well as all of the costs necessary to bring it to the condition and location necessary for its intended use 
repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
capital assets are classified as construction in progress cip when initially acquired  and reclassified to the appropriate asset account when placed into service 
depreciation expense is not recorded on assets not yet placed into service 
materials purchased to build flywheels for use in company owned frequency regulation facilities are classified as cip  along with the related labor and overhead costs 
no overhead is generally applied for other internally constructed projects not directly related to our core business eg  leasehold improvements 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the conditions to be considered include whether or not the asset is in service  has become obsolete  is damaged  or whether external market circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when appropriate  we recognize a loss for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and the carrying amount 
the fair value of the asset is measured using either available market prices or estimated discounted cash flows 
our analyses indicate that there was an impairment of certain long lived assets as a result of the december prototype malfunction  and we recognized an asset impairment charge of approximately  in this represented the estimated cost to repair certain damaged items 
based on our annual analysis  no asset impairment charges were considered necessary for in  we incurred a restructuring and impairment charge of million of which million represented impaired capital equipment and leasehold improvements 
many of the assets for which a reserve had previously been recorded were disposed of during the move to the tyngsboro facility  and therefore the assets and the related accumulated depreciation and reserves were written off as of the end of fiscal overview our initial product strategy was to develop high energy  composite flywheels for back up powering of telecommunications applications 
our product was in low rate initial production when the collapse of the telecommunications market began in we recognized that our smart energy flywheel products as alternative backup solutions to the telecommunications industry were not a means to produce meaningful revenues 
with that recognition  we initiated a series of cost cutting measures throughout and the focus of these efforts were to reduce cash usage while preserving our intellectual properties and maintaining the integrity of our public company requirements while evaluating all potential product markets for our technologies and considering acquisitions or mergers that could lead to increased shareholder value 
we have i identified promising applications for our smart energy matrix design in the electric utility power grid marketplace 
ii pursued additional development and design contracts for a variety of applications by federal agencies 
we have been successful in obtaining contracts and are continuing our efforts to obtain additional research and development funding 
iii field tested scale model smart energy matrix flywheel systems for frequency regulation in two states  which has resulted in certification or acceptance of our technology for frequency regulation in three isos  as discussed elsewhere in this document 
iv completed a significant portion of the development effort for our smart energy flywheel 
we must raise additional funds to execute our business plan 
although funding of approximately million was raised in  based on our rate of expenditure of cash and the additional expenditures expected to support our business plan  we estimate that we have sufficient cash to fund operations into approximately the fourth quarter of we need to obtain additional investments in to fund our continuation as a going concern ongoing research and development of the smart energy flywheel and the smart energy matrix multi flywheel system continuing the ramp up of our manufacturing and assembly capacity the design and build out of facilities to provide frequency regulation services to the electricity grid working capital requirements  and the identification and development of new business opportunities 
in order to complete development of the smart energy matrix flywheel system  build  operate and receive fees for frequency regulation services of at least one megawatt from a commercial sized flywheel based frequency regulation system and have sufficient working capital to continue to execute our business plan through  we will need to raise approximately million of funding 
also  we will need to raise additional amounts through equity and debt beyond the foregoing million to finance the additional frequency regulation facilities that are contemplated by our business plan 
as part of our new business development  we may evaluate possible acquisitions of enterprises or technologies that we would consider synergistic from a market  technology or product perspective 
from inception through december   we have incurred losses of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur losses as we expand our product development and begin to increase our manufacturing capacity 
revenues we were awarded fixed price research and development contracts from government agencies and are pursuing similar contracts from other government agencies 
we have determined that we will recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method for such contracts 
we are continuing to evaluate markets for our flywheel systems but we have not recognized revenues from these products 
we have placed development prototype flywheels with potential customers and shipped pre production units 
these flywheel products were provided to potential customers without charge or on a demonstration basis to allow us access to field test information and to demonstrate the application of our technologies 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold on fixed price research and development contracts are predominantly being recorded on the percentage of completion method and consist primarily of direct labor and material  subcontracting and associated overhead costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for sales and marketing personnel and related business development expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we expand efforts to define new markets for our products 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits related to our corporate staff  professional fees  insurance and travel 
in  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased  primarily due to compensation costs associated with equity based compensation 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for are approximately lower than during the same period during  due primarily to a reduction in public company expenses  reduced use of subcontractors and consultants  lower stock compensation expense as a result of fewer new hire option grants and a lower black scholes fair value for options issued during the early portions of the fiscal year and allocation of a portion of our general and administrative expenses to our government contracts 
these reductions in cost were partially offset by slight increases in salaries and benefits resulting from new hires 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in over due primarily to additional staffing to support expanding our marketing efforts for government sales and government backed loans for new facilities as well as increased regulatory efforts to modify market rules to insure our ability to compete in these markets 
research and development our cost of research and development consists primarily of the cost of compensation and benefits for research and development staff  as well as materials and supplies used in the engineering design and development process 
in  we began development efforts on our smart energy flywheel system  and research and development costs have increased considerably from to  and again from to our research and development costs during were approximately higher than during the same period in  due to higher engineering salary and benefit costs related to headcount increases late in to support development and testing  higher facility costs and moving expenses  increased use of consultants and contractors  as well as more expense material used to develop and test our smart energy flywheel system 
we expect research and development expenses to increase during as we finalize our designs and focus on our cost reduction objectives 
loss on contract commitments we will establish reserves for anticipated losses on contract commitments if  based on cost estimates to complete the commitment  we determine that a loss will be incurred 
we recorded a million charge during and million in for anticipated losses on our research and development contracts 
in  we completed all but one of our existing contracts 
these contracts were completed at costs that were lower than previously anticipated  and we recorded a reduction of approximately million to the contract loss reserve 
we are most likely to recognize probable losses on contract commitments early in a product s introduction prior to being able to realize expected decreases in cost per unit through engineering design changes  operating efficiencies  and volume purchasing discounts 
on government contracts  we will  on a quarterly basis  evaluate our estimated costs to complete and establish reserves when appropriate 
restructuring and asset impairment charges we did not recognize any material restructuring charges in  or asset impairment charges of approximately  were recorded in related to damages resulting from a prototype malfunction in december depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization is primarily related to depreciation on capital expenditures and the amortization of lease and leasehold costs related to our facilities 
we have intellectual property in the form of patents on our flywheel vacuum system  heat pipe cooling systems  dc output paralleling  metal hub  low loss motor  co mingled rims and earthquake tolerant bearings on our flywheel products  anti islanding software  drawings  source code and production know how on our smart power m inverter system  and expect to obtain other patents during and beyond 
these costs were being amortized during  but we recorded impairment charges to write down these assets to zero on the balance sheet at december  these impairment charges were made due to the uncertainty of realizing any future value from this property mainly due the lack of substantial revenues to date 
accordingly  all costs incurred during  and related to the development of intellectual property were expensed as incurred 
interest and other income expense  net in and  non operating income consisted primarily of interest income resulting from cash on hand 
approximately  and  were received in and  respectively  in settlement of a class action suit relating to unfair practices engaged in by certain insurance brokerage firms  and a gain related to the sale of a fixed asset of approximately  was recognized in in  our non operating income and expenses were primarily attributable to realized gains on the sale of our available for sale securities and a warrant  a write back resulting from loan payments on a reserved loan to a former officer of the company  a cash settlement relating to our failed attempt to acquire nxtphase t d corporation  interest income resulting from cash on hand  accrued dividends receivable and the conversion premium from the conversion of our holdings of series a preferred stock of evergreen solar  inc  partially offset by interest expense associated with our capital leases 
accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting pronouncements share based payments during the first quarter of  we adopted the provisions of  and accounted for  stock based compensation in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we also adopted sec staff accounting bulletin sab  which provides additional guidance on disclosure topics related to share based payments 
under the fair value recognition requirement of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense as it is earned over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
to implement this standard  we elected the modified prospective transition method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified 
estimated compensation expense for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining vesting period using the compensation cost estimated for the sfas r pro forma disclosures 
the adoption of sfas r had a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stock based compensation assumptions and expenses  including pro forma disclosures for prior periods as if we had recorded stock based compensation expense during such periods 
accounting changes and error corrections during the first quarter of  we also adopted sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
 which became effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition guidance  those provisions should be followed 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
there have been no accounting changes or error corrections required since our adoption of this pronouncement that required retroactive restatements 
correcting prior year errors in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which became effective for fiscal years ending after november  sab no 
requires that companies utilize a dual approach to assessing the quantitative effects of financial statements misstatements 
the dual approach includes both an income statement focused and balance sheet focused assessment 
to date  implementation of this guidance has not had any significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
we adopted interpretation no 
as of the first quarter of interpretation no 
requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  as well as enhanced disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions  including a roll forward of tax benefits taken that do not qualify for financial statement recognition 
refer to note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for more information regarding our application of interpretation no 
and its impact on our consolidated financial statements

during we recovered essentially all of the costs associated with the malfunction from our insurance carriers 
the insurance proceeds were used to offset previously recorded casualty losses and to offset the costs of expensed materials used to build the prototype flywheel 
in addition to costs associated with the malfunction  we spent approximately  to investigate the cause of the malfunction and to insure that the necessary modifications were implemented to prevent similar malfunctions in the future 
these costs are included in the increased cost shown for consultants and subcontractors  above 
we expect research and development costs during to be higher than in although critical testing of the smart energy flywheel is complete  we continue to perform various operational tests and other development work aimed at achieving manufacturing cost reductions 
additionally  we expect occupancy costs in our new  larger facility in tyngsboro to be higher than those at our wilmington facility 
loss on contract commitments our contracts have been primarily for the development of demonstration units of new products and the design of a frequency regulation plant 
as such  the work has supported our core research and development efforts 
most of these contracts have been structured on a cost share basis  for which the expected cost share has been recorded as a contract loss 
we recorded contract commitment losses on our research and development contracts in of  based on expected cost overruns related to material  labor and overhead required to complete the contracts 
during  we recorded additional charges totaling approximately  to the contract loss reserve 
this amount consisted of net increases in estimated material  labor  overhead and travel costs expected to complete existing contracts along with our expected cost share portion of the sandia contract 
by the end of  all but one smaller government contract was complete 
we recorded a reduction to the losses on contract commitments of approximately  based on the actual cost to complete these contracts  which was less than previously estimated 
this amount consisted of net decreases in material  labor  overhead and travel costs required to complete existing contracts of approximately  in addition  since our actual overhead rate was lower than forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year  we reduced the overhead applied to the contracts and our contract loss reserve by an additional depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation expense for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in of approximately  or  is primarily attributable to depreciation on new assets acquired during and the latter half of we expect depreciation for to be substantially higher than during primarily due to capital expenditures relating to leasehold improvements at our new manufacturing and office facility in tyngsboro as well as the purchase of machinery and equipment required to begin commercial production 
in addition  we will begin to depreciate assets associated with our frequency regulation facilities that we expect to begin commercial operation in the fourth quarter of interest and other income expense  net interest income for the year ended december   was approximately  greater than for the equivalent period in the primary reason for this difference is that cash balances available for investing were on average higher than during the same period in the prior year  primarily as a result of the cash obtained through the sale of stock and warrants at various times during the increased interest income was offset by decreases in other income of approximately  net loss as a result of the changes discussed above  the net loss for the year ended december   was approximately  as compared to a net loss during the same period in of approximately  this represents an increase in net loss of approximately  or 
the increase in the loss for the year is due primarily to the factors discussed above  particularly increased spending on research and development activities  facility costs related to the move to the tyngsboro facility and the temporary maintenance of two facilities  partially offset by decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses and the reduction in contract loss recorded during comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  change change in thousands revenue  cost of goods sold  gross margin selling  general and administrative   research and development    loss on contract commitments   depreciation and amortization casualty loss interest and other income expense  net net loss    revenue the following table provides details of our revenues for the twelve months ended december  and year ended december  cumulative contract value earned percent complete total contract value dollars in thousands cec   nyserda pon bechtel bettis nyserda pon air force research laboratory sandia doe earmark total contract revenue    inverter and accessories total    in the year ended december   we recorded revenue from flywheel related research and development contracts using the percentage of completion method of approximately  and approximately  from the sale of smart power m inverter systems and related products

liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents   working capital   cash provided by used in operating activities   investing activities  financing activities  net decrease in cash and cash equivalents   current ratio our cash requirements depend on many factors including  but not limited to  cost to build our flywheels and frequency regulation facilities  research and development activities  facility costs as well as general and administrative expenses 
since we are still in the development stage and have not yet begun our principal operations  we do not generate enough cash from operations to satisfy our working capital requirements 
we expect to make significant expenditures to fund our operations  develop technologies and explore opportunities to find and develop additional markets to sell our products 
in previous years  we took significant actions to reduce our cash expenditures for product development  infrastructure and production readiness by significantly reducing headcount  development spending and capital expenditures 
however  as we near completion of development of the smart energy matrix and prepare to begin commercial activity aimed at revenue generation in  we have begun to increase our headcount  and have spent additional funds on expense materials  capital equipment and market analyses to understand the size of markets  competitive aspects and advantages that our products could provide 
we expect to use more cash resources during as we work to develop the capacity to manufacture our smart energy flywheels in anticipation of having a frequency regulation facility in service at two isos during the fourth quarter of we must raise additional equity to execute our business plan 
based on our rate of expenditure of cash and the additional expenditures expected to support our business plan  we have sufficient cash to fund operations into approximately the fourth quarter of we need to obtain additional cash during to fund our continuation as a going concern ongoing research and development of the smart energy flywheel and the smart energy matrix multi flywheel system the ramp up of our manufacturing and assembly capacity the build out of facilities to provide frequency regulation services to the electricity grid working capital requirements  and the identification and development of new business opportunities

operating activities net cash used in operating activities was approximately   and  for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
the primary component to the negative cash flow from operations is from net losses 
net loss for was approximately  cash used by operations was partially reduced by an insurance recovery of approximately  relating to a malfunction that occurred in december during testing of a prototype flywheel 
in addition  the net operating loss was partially offset by non cash charges of approximately  and  for stock compensation expense and depreciation  respectively

we may make investments in companies for strategic business reasons 
because our primary motivation in making these investments may not be to realize a profit on the investment itself  but rather to expand our business prospects  these investments may lack any financial return to the company and may result in a loss of principal and may impair our liquidity 
the following table summarizes our commitments at december  description of commitment operating leases purchase obligations total year ending december    december    december    december    december    december    thereafter   total commitments    at december   we had firm commitments with our suppliers of approximately million 
these commitments are for components for our commercial flywheel systems  completion of the build out of the tyngsboro facility  and to satisfy contractual obligations for our research and development programs 
in july  we signed a seven year lease on a new corporate headquarters that significantly expanded our manufacturing capacity and provides sufficient space to continue our research and development activities 
the amounts listed for operating leases represent payments for the occupancy of our principal executive offices  laboratory and manufacturing facilities located at middlesex road tyngsboro  massachusetts 
this  square foot facility has manufacturing capacity for the production of up to flywheels per year 
we have a second phase manufacturing build out planned that will increase annual manufacturing capacity to more than  flywheels 
the lease on our previous facility in wilmington  ma expired at the end of november as part of the tyngsboro lease agreement  we issued to the landlord  shares of our common stock pursuant to our registration statement on form s filed on august   which we amended on august  and became effective on august   and a warrant exercisable for  shares of our common stock pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of  as amended  in return for lower cash payments payable by us under the lease 
we have provided the wilmington and tyngsboro lessors with irrevocable letters of credit securing our performance under these leases with a balance at december  of  which are reduced periodically during the lease terms 
these letters of credit are secured by a cash deposit  which is included in restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we are responsible for real estate taxes and all operating expenses of the tyngsboro facility 
in the future  additional capital expenditures will be required for a phase two build out of manufacturing capacity 
the amount and timing of these expenditures are dependent on requirements of equipment needed to meet production schedules as well as having sufficient funding 
by the end of  we had substantially completed all critical performance tests on the smart energy flywheel  and as a result we have placed orders for materials required to build our first commercial flywheel units 
financing in february  we sold  units of the company at a purchase price of per unit 
each unit consisted of one share of our common stock  par value per share  and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for a total of  warrants 
as part of the transaction   warrants were issued to the placement agent 
the units were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the securities and exchange commission in connection with our registration statement on form s filed on september   which became effective on december  we filed a request with the securities and exchange commission on august  that this registration statement on form s be withdrawn and the unsold securities deregistered  and filed a new shelf registration statement on form s for million on august   which we amended on august  and became effective on august  in july we entered into a lease for a new facility in tyngsboro  ma 
we agreed under the terms of the lease to issue to the landlord pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of  as amended  a warrant exercisable for  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant and the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant are restricted securities and may not be sold without registration under the securities act of  as amended  and applicable state securities laws or an exemption there from 
in addition  we issued the landlord  shares of common stock 
in september  we sold  units of the company at a purchase price of per unit

the units were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the securities and exchange commission in connection with our registration statement on form s for million filed on august   which we amended on august  and became effective on august  there were no significant financing activities during inasmuch as we are not expecting to become cash flow positive until at least  our ability to continue as a going concern will depend on our ability to raise additional capital 
we may not be able to raise this capital at all  or if it we are able to do so  it may be on terms that are adverse to shareholders 
we believe that project debt financing may be available to us to meet some portion of our cash requirements for inflation our operations have not been materially affected by inflation 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash equivalents and investments  all of which have maturities of less than ninety days  could expose us to interest rate risk 
at december   we had approximately  of cash equivalents that were held in a non interest bearing checking account 
also at december  we had approximately million of cash equivalents that were held in interest bearing money market accounts at high quality financial institutions  some of which are invested in off shore securities 
the fair value of these investments approximates their cost 
a change in interest rates would change the investment income realized on an annual basis by approximately  which we do not believe is material 
the funds invested in money market accounts may not be covered under fdic insurance  and therefore may be at some risk of loss
