business overview we are a leading global medical device company focused on catheter based technologies for the endovascular treatment of vascular diseases and disorders 
within the endovascular market  we have targeted our business strategy efforts on the peripheral vascular and neurovascular markets  which we believe offer high growth potential with fewer entrenched competitors 
we are focused on emerging and under innovated opportunities which treat peripheral and neurovascular patients around the world  a strategy that we believe allows us to compete with smaller companies that have narrow product lines and lack an international sales force and infrastructure  yet also compete with larger companies that do not have our focus and agility 
we believe the overall market for endovascular devices will grow as the demand for minimally invasive treatment of vascular diseases and disorders continues to increase 
we intend to capitalize on this market opportunity by the continued introduction of new products 
we expect to originate these new products primarily through our internal research and development and clinical efforts  but we may supplement them with acquisitions or other external collaborations 
additionally  our growth has been  and will continue to be  impacted by our expansion into new geographic markets and the expansion of our direct sales organization in existing geographic markets 
in october  we completed our acquisition of foxhollow technologies  inc foxhollow designs  develops  manufactures and sells medical devices primarily for the treatment of peripheral artery disease and for the removal of thrombus 
foxhollow s principal product is the silverhawk plaque excision system  which is a minimally invasive catheter system that treats peripheral artery disease by removing plaque in order to reopen narrowed or blocked arteries 
the foxhollow acquisition has created a combined company that we believe possesses one of the largest us distribution footprints in peripheral and neurovascular devices with one of the broadest and most technologically advanced product offerings 
our product portfolio includes a broad spectrum of over products consisting of over  skus to treat vascular disease in both the peripheral and neurovascular markets  including stents  atherectomy and thrombectomy products  pta balloons  embolic protection devices  infusion catheters wires  embolic coils and liquid embolics 
as a result of our foxhollow acquisition  we also are engaged in a research collaboration with merck co  inc for the analysis of atherosclerotic plaque removed from patient arteries with the goal of identifying new biomarkers for atherosclerotic disease progression and new therapies for atherosclerotic disease 
our management  including our chief executive officer who is our chief operating decision maker  report and manage our operations in two reportable business segments based on similarities in the products sold  customer base and distribution system 
our peripheral vascular segment  which was formerly referred to as our cardio peripheral segment  contains products that are used primarily in peripheral vascular procedures by radiologists  vascular surgeons and cardiologists and in targeted cardiovascular procedures 
our neurovascular segment contains products that are used primarily by neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons 
our sales activities and operations are aligned closely with our business segments 
we generally have dedicated peripheral vascular sales teams in the united states and europe that target customers who perform primarily peripheral vascular procedures and separate  dedicated neurovascular sales teams in the united states and europe that are specifically focused on our neurovascular business customer base 

table of contents we have corporate infrastructure and direct sales capabilities in the united states  canada  europe and other countries and have established distribution relationships in the united states  canada and selected international markets 
our corporate headquarters and our principal manufacturing  research and development  and us sales operations for our peripheral vascular product line are located in plymouth  minnesota 
our foxhollow atherectomy and thrombectomy products are manufactured in redwood city  california 
our manufacturing  research and development  and us sales operations for our neurovascular product lines are located in irvine  california 
outside of the united states  our primary office is in paris  france 
we sell our products in more than countries and have dedicated substantial resources to building our us and international direct sales and marketing infrastructure that includes a worldwide sales force of approximately sales professionals as of december  in the united states  canada and europe 
our direct sales representatives accounted for approximately of our net sales during and  with the balance generated by independent distributors 
in  we were awarded three  three year contracts by novation  the health care contracting and services company of vha and the university health system consortium  two national health care alliances  providing their nearly  hospital members and affiliates access to certain of our peripheral vascular and neurovascular products 
in addition  in  we were awarded a single source  new technology agreement by novation for our onyx liquid embolic system 
we expanded the sales force selling our neurovascular products in late from approximately sales representatives to sales representatives by december  primarily to support the launch of the axium detachable coil system 
since our acquisition of foxhollow  we have spent considerable time and resources integrating our two operations  including in particular  our us peripheral vascular sales force  and training our combined sales force on our combined product offering and cross selling opportunities 
we reduced the number of our us peripheral vascular sales representatives from approximately at the time of our acquisition of foxhollow to approximately as of december  we also have focused on our international strategy for silverhawk 
during fourth quarter  we performed our first silverhawk case in europe and have focused on training physicians  establishing key opinion leaders  conducting european clinical research and developing specific product and procedure reimbursement strategies to support our international sales efforts for our foxhollow products 
in order to drive sales growth  we have invested heavily throughout our history in not only the expansion of our global distribution system  but also new product development and clinical trials to obtain regulatory approvals 
a significant portion of our net sales has historically been  and we expect to continue to be  attributable to new and enhanced products 
in  we launched our prot g rx carotid stents  additional lengths in our everflex family of stents and our silverhawk ls m and ms m products in the united states for the peripheral vascular market and our axium coil for the neurovascular market 
to date  in  we have launched the silverhawk lx m device in the united states and received fda clearance for our rockhawk atherectomy system for surgical use 
our focus in and continuing in is to further validate the clinical and competitive benefits of our technology platforms to drive new and enhanced products 
to accomplish this  we have a number of clinical trials underway and others that are currently in development  including our durability i trial in europe measuring the durability of our prot g everflex stent in sfa lesions  our durability ii trial in the united states with the objective of expanding our everflex stent s us indication to include treatment of peripheral artery disease  our prove it trial designed to study the use of balloon expandable and self expanding stents for percutaneous stent treatment in iliac vessels and our us clinical trial for percutaneous removal of calcium using our rockhawk and spiderfx devices 
summary of results and outlook for while the financial results of our first three fiscal quarters of were characterized by strong net sales growth in both our peripheral vascular and neurovascular business segments as well as domestic and international markets  our fourth fiscal quarter of results were substantially and adversely affected by the completion of our acquisition of foxhollow and difficulties in integrating the combined businesses 
our us peripheral vascular business in particular was negatively impacted by greater than anticipated sales force integration challenges related to the foxhollow acquisition and higher than expected customer inventory levels 
table of contents of silverhawk products 
although we believe that certain actions we have taken  including eliminating a layer of sales management and optimizing the size of our us peripheral vascular sales organization  will enable us to overcome the integration challenges and support our future growth objectives  no assurance can be provided that such actions will do so and we still expect such challenges and factors to continue to adversely affect our net sales into the second half of we remain confident in the strategic and financial rationale for our foxhollow acquisition 
one of the key benefits of the acquisition was the opportunity to combine two experienced sales forces with well established physician relationships and to leverage the combined company s expanded product portfolio to increase sales through cross selling opportunities 
while our cross selling initiative did not gain the traction we had expected during fourth quarter  we have reduced the combined company s expense base and anticipate realizing approximately million in expense savings on an annual basis going forward as a result of the acquisition and believe we now have the appropriate sales structure and focus in place to take advantage of the potential revenue synergies 
in  we intend to focus on expanding our position in the peripheral vascular market by offering a full complement of innovative products through our large direct sales organization  taking advantage of cross selling opportunities and leveraging our recent agreements with novation to gain access to new customers  continuing our expansion in international markets  investing in development of next generation products  such as the rockhawk  and supporting the necessary clinical trial initiatives to drive broader product and procedure adoption and to bring new products to market 
while our outlook for remains positive  we will continue to keep a cautionary eye on continuing difficulties integrating our foxhollow business  customer inventory levels  decreased demand for our silverhawk products  regulatory actions  developments in outstanding and threatened litigation  competitive actions and other factors identified under the heading item a 
risk factors contained elsewhere in this report  which could cause our actual results to differ from our anticipated outlook 
our fiscal results and financial condition included the following items of significance  some of which we expect may also affect our results and financial condition in our net sales increased to million in compared to reflecting sales growth in each of our reportable business segments and geographic markets 
in particular  our sales growth was positively affected by an increase in sales of our everflex self expanding stents and neurovascular products  increased market penetration of products introduced during the past two years and our acquisition of foxhollow 
net sales of our peripheral vascular products increased to million in compared to primarily as a result of increased market penetration of our everflex and prot g rx carotid stents  spiderfx embolic protection device and pta balloon catheters and our acquisition of foxhollow  partially offset by sales declines in older generation products 
we expect our peripheral vascular sales to increase in as compared to primarily as a result of increased cross selling opportunities as a result of our acquisition of foxhollow  the introduction of our atherectomy products into international markets  additional market penetration of products launched during and and new product introductions anticipated in we believe that our atherectomy  stent and embolic protection sales will continue to contribute to our sales growth in our peripheral vascular segment in as compared to net sales of our neurovascular products increased to million in compared to primarily as a result of increased market penetration of our existing products  including in particular our onyx liquid embolic system for the treatment of brain arterial venous malformations and our axium coil  which was launched on a worldwide basis in fourth quarter  and sales growth in virtually all of our neurovascular access and delivery products  partially offset by sales declines in older generation products 
we expect our neurovascular sales to increase in as compared to due to market growth  developing new customer accounts  additional market penetration of products launched during and  and new product introductions anticipated in  including our solitaire flow restoration stent which we have recently started to selectively commercialize in europe 

table of contents in october  we completed our acquisition of foxhollow  which broadened our peripheral vascular product offering to include atherectomy and additional thrombectomy products  including in particular the silverhawk plaque excision system 
our net sales in included million of net sales from foxhollow products 
as a result of our foxhollow acquisition  we now recognize research collaboration revenue and incur research collaboration expense from our collaboration and license agreement with merck 
research collaboration revenue  which is recognized on a straight line basis over the four year term of the license exclusivity portion of the agreement and further limited to cumulative amounts due and collected at any given point under the arrangement  was million in research collaboration expense was million in as a result of dr 
simpson s resignation from our board of directors in february  merck has the right to terminate the collaboration and license agreement at any time within six months of dr 
simpson s resignation 
we expect that research collaboration expense will fluctuate in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our research collaboration revenue as the amount of services we perform under the agreement will vary from period to period 
approximately of our net sales during were generated outside of the united states compared to during the sales growth in our international markets was primarily a result of new product introductions and increased market penetration of existing products 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact of million on our net sales as compared to a positive impact of  on our net sales  principally resulting in both periods from the performance of the euro against the us dollar 
in our peripheral vascular segment  product cost of goods sold as a percentage of product sales decreased to in compared to in primarily attributable to increased sales volumes  offset by the commencement of royalty payments in on certain of our nitinol products  the write up of foxhollow inventory as required under purchase accounting which increased product cost of goods sold by million when the inventory was sold in the fourth quarter  and adjustments in our excess and obsolete inventory reserves for the planned discontinuance of the primus balloon expandable stent and the sailor 
balloon due to our strategic marketing focus on new product introductions 
in our neurovascular segment  cost of goods sold as a percentage of product sales decreased to in compared to in primarily attributable to increased sales volumes and on going cost savings programs  offset by the commencement of royalty payments in on certain of our nitinol products 
we expect product cost of goods sold as a percentage of product sales to decline in as compared to due to higher volumes in our manufacturing facilities and efficiency improvements from manufacturing initiatives  offset in part by anticipated conversion costs associated with new product launches anticipated to occur in we incurred special charges of million in as a result of us entering into agreements in principle to settle certain patent infringement and other litigation with the regents of the university of california and boston scientific corporation in the third quarter 
we have not yet entered into final definitive settlement agreements but expect to do so in the near future 
our operating expenses increased in compared to primarily as a result of our acquisition of foxhollow 
in  our operating expenses included a charge of million for acquired in process research and development as a result of the acquisition 
we expect our sales  general and administrative expenses  research and development expense and amortization of intangible assets to increase in absolute dollars in as compared to we expect sales  general and administrative expenses and research and development to decline as a percentage of net sales 
in april  we completed a secondary public offering issuing  shares of our common stock which generated approximately million in net proceeds to us 
at the time of the foxhollow acquisition  foxhollow had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we used million to pay foxhollow stockholders the cash portion of the 
table of contents merger consideration 
total consideration for the transaction was million and is discussed further in note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
our subsidiaries  ev endovascular  inc  ev international  inc  micro therapeutics  inc and foxhollow technologies  inc  are parties to a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  consisting of a million revolving line of credit and a million equipment financing line 
in march  we increased the four year equipment financing line from million to million 
the revolving line of credit expires in june our net loss for increased to million  or per share  in compared to million  or per share  in our focus for is to improve our profitability 
although we expect to generate cash from operations in  no assurance can be provided that we will do so  especially if we incur significant unanticipated costs or do not achieve our anticipated net sales during our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments available to fund our current operations were million at december  we believe our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  anticipated cash from operations and current and anticipated financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next months 
sales and expense components the following is a description of the primary components of our net sales and expenses product net sales 
we derive our product net sales from the sale of endovascular devices in two primary business segments peripheral vascular and neurovascular devices 
most of our sales are generated by our global  direct sales force and are shipped and billed to hospitals or clinics throughout the world 
in countries where we do not have a direct sales force  sales are generated by shipments to distributors who  in turn  sell to hospitals and clinics 
in cases where our products are held in consignment at a customer s location  we generate sales at the time the product is used in surgery and we are notified in writing by the hospital that the product was used  rather than at shipment 
we charge our customers for shipping and record shipping income as part of net sales 
research collaboration revenue 
research collaboration revenue is derived from our collaboration and license agreement with merck  which we assumed as a result of our acquisition of foxhollow 
under the agreement  merck agreed to pay foxhollow million in equal installments over the initial four year term of the research collaboration  in exchange for foxhollow s agreement to collaborate exclusively with merck during such period with respect to certain fields 
merck may extend these exclusivity obligations  on a year to year basis  in the event it also elects to extend the term of the collaboration beyond the initial four year term  by making additional payments to us of million per year  which merck may offset against its royalty and milestone obligations during such year 
under the agreement  merck also agreed to provide a minimum of million in funding to foxhollow over the first three years of the four year collaboration program term  for research activities to be conducted by foxhollow under merck s direction 
in the event merck extends the collaboration beyond its initial four year term  merck would be required to fund our additional activities under the collaboration on an as performed basis 
we will receive milestone payments on successful development of drug products or diagnostic tests utilizing results from the collaboration  as well as royalties on sales by merck of drugs and diagnostic products developed through the collaboration 
our research collaboration revenue from merck is recognized on a straight line basis over the four year term of the license exclusivity portion of the agreement and further limited to cumulative amounts due and collected at any given point under the arrangement 
for additional discussion  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

table of contents research and development expense 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expense increased to in compared to in this increase was due primarily to increased spending on clinical trials and the additional activity related to our acquisition of foxhollow in amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of the amortization of intangible assets purchased in connection with our acquisition of foxhollow and the amortization of our invatec distribution rights which we received in february  slightly offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in for additional discussion of the amortization of intangible assets purchased in connection with our acquisition of foxhollow  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
acquired in process research and development 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in acquired in process research and development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative use in connection with the foxhollow acquisition 
at the time we acquired foxhollow  we expected all acquired in process research and development to reach technological feasibility  however there is no assurance that these projects will attain commercial viability 
the endovascular device market is highly competitive and designs change often to adjust to patent constraints and to changing market preferences 
therefore  product life cycles are relatively short 
if we do not introduce new products and technologies  or if our new products and technologies are not accepted by the physicians who use them or the payors who reimburse the costs of the procedures performed with them  or if there are any delays in our introduction of new products  we may not be successful in attaining commercial viability for these projects 
we may experience delays in any phase of a product launch  including during research and development  clinical trials  regulatory approvals  manufacturing  marketing and the education process 
many of our clinical trials have durations of several years and it is possible that competing therapies  such as drug therapies  may be introduced while our products are still undergoing clinical trials 
new products and technologies introduced by competitors may reach the market earlier  may be more effective or less expensive than our products or render our products obsolete 
the most significant acquired research and development projects were the next generation silverhawk project and rockhawk project which represents of the acquired research and development projects 
we attributed approximately million of fair value to the next generation silverhawk project 
the silverhawk plaque excision system is a minimally invasive catheter system that treats peripheral artery disease by removing plaque in order to reopen narrowed or blocked arteries 
the next generation silverhawk is designed to improve the procedure time  cutting efficiency and ease of use in the existing silverhawk system 
we expect to incur approximately million to bring the next generation silverhawk device to commercial viability 
we estimate that we will realize cash flows from the next generation silverhawk device during the first half of we attributed approximately million of fair value to the rockhawk project 
the rockhawk is designed to treat calcified lesions with a stronger blade 
we expect to incur approximately million to bring the rockhawk device to commercial viability 
in february  we received approval for surgical use of the rockhawk device in the united states 
we are currently working with the fda on a clinical trial design and investigational device exemption submission for peripheral use 
the realization of cash flows related to the rockhawk device is contingent on the timing of the fda approval for peripheral use

net sales of our neurovascular products increased to million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of increased market penetration of our onyx liquid embolic system and nexus coils  as well as continued penetration of our microcatheters and occlusion balloon systems 
sales of our embolic products increased to million in compared to primarily due to increased market penetration of our onyx liquid embolic system for the treatment of brain avms since its united states launch in july  volume increases in such product internationally and volume increases in our nexus family of embolic coils

although these expenses increased in absolute dollars  as a percentage of net sales  sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in compared to of net sales in research and development expense 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expense decreased to in compared to in this reduction was due to the increase in net sales combined with a decrease in clinical study expenses related to the completion of certain clinical trials in the decrease in clinical costs was partially offset by increased spending on certain internal development efforts 
amortization of intangible assets

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our business is seasonal in nature 
historically  demand for our products has been the highest in our fourth fiscal quarter 
we traditionally experience lower sales volumes in our third fiscal quarter than throughout the rest of the year as a result of the european holiday schedule during the summer months 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience meaningful variability in our net sales and gross profit among quarters  as well as within each quarter  as a result of a number of factors  including  among other things  the timing and extent of promotional pricing or volume discounts  the timing of larger orders by customers and the timing of shipment of such orders  changes in average selling prices  the number and mix of products sold in the quarter  the availability and cost of components and materials  costs  benefits and timing of new product introductions  and the timing and amount of services performed under our license and collaboration agreement with merck

other liquidity information the acquisition agreements relating to our purchase of appriva medical  inc and dendron gmbh require us to make additional payments to the sellers of these businesses if certain milestones related to regulatory steps in the product commercialization process are achieved 
the potential milestone payments total million and million with respect to the appriva and dendron acquisitions  respectively  during the period of to we have determined that the first milestone with respect to the appriva agreement was not achieved by the january  milestone date and that the first milestone is not payable 
in september  we announced that we had decided to discontinue the development and commercialization of the technology we acquired in the appriva transaction 
we are currently involved in litigation regarding this agreement as described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
under the terms of the stock purchase agreement entered into in connection with our acquisition of dendron  we were required to make additional payments which are contingent upon dendron products achieving certain revenue targets between and in  the million revenue target for sales of dendron products during was met

in august  foxhollow received a letter from counsel for the shareholder representatives of kerberos alleging that foxhollow has not used commercially reasonable efforts to market  promote  sell and distribute kerberos rinspirator products  as required under the agreement and plan of merger between foxhollow and kerberos 
we have been in discussions with the shareholder representatives of kerberos regarding their allegation 
there can be no assurance that the stockholder representatives of kerberos will not commence litigation on the alleged claims 
in june  we sold and licensed  on a royalty free perpetual basis  certain intellectual property relating to percutaneously delivered implants within the left atrial appendage for prevention of emboli migration out of the appendage 
in connection with the sale  we also obtained a royalty free perpetual license from the purchaser that allows us to use certain of the intellectual property sold to the purchaser outside of the left atrial appendage market 
in exchange for the assets and the license  we received million in cash  shares of common stock of the purchaser representing approximately of its equity on a fully diluted basis and an unsecured  subordinated  non interest bearing promissory note in the principal amount of million  the unpaid principal balance of which will become immediately due and payable only upon an initial public offering by the purchaser or a sale transaction  in each case resulting in gross proceeds of less than a certain amount

our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors  including the extent and duration of future operating losses  the level and timing of future sales and expenditures  the results and 
table of contents scope of ongoing research and product development programs  working capital to support our sales growth  receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  sales and marketing programs  continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace  competing technologies  market and regulatory developments  acquisitions and the future course of intellectual property and other litigation 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  anticipated cash from operations and current and anticipated financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next months 
in the event that we require additional working capital to fund future operations and any future acquisitions  we may sell shares of our common stock or other equity securities  sell debt securities  or enter into additional credit and financing arrangements with one or more independent institutional lenders 
there is no assurance that any financing transaction will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  or that any financing transaction will not be dilutive to our current stockholders 
if we require additional working capital  but are not able to raise additional funds  we may be required to significantly curtail or cease ongoing operations 
from time to time  we may also sell a given technology or intellectual property having a development timeline or development cost that is inconsistent with our investment horizon or which does not adequately complement our existing product portfolio 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our physician customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
changes in these estimates and changes in our business could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our critical financial estimates with the audit committee and our board of directors 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements 
our critical financial estimates are described below revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before sales can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are met at the time of shipment when risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor  unless a consignment arrangement exists 
sales from consignment arrangements are recognized upon written notification that the product has been used by the customer indicating that a sale is complete 
our terms of sale for regular sales are typically fob shipping point  net days 
regular sales include orders from customers for replacement of customer stock  replenishment of consignment product used by customers  orders for a scheduled case surgery and stocking orders 

table of contents we allow customers to return defective or damaged products for credit 
our estimate for sales returns is based upon contractual commitments and historical return experience which we analyze by geography and is recorded as a reduction of sales for the period in which the related sales occurred 
historically  our return experience has been low with return rates of less than of our net sales 
stock based compensation we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and other equity incentive awards 
the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables which include the expected life of the award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards  expected dividend yield  risk free interest rate and the forfeiture rate 
we estimate the expected term of options based upon our historical experience 
we estimate expected volatility and forfeiture rates based on a combination of historical factors related to our common stock since our june initial public offering and the volatility rates of a set of guideline companies 
the guideline companies consist of public and recently public medical technology companies 
the risk free interest rate is determined using us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term 
dividend yield is estimated to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no plans of doing so in the future 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods as necessary 
we use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
generally  all stock based compensation is amortized on a straight line basis over the respective requisite service periods  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our results of operations 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our sfas r disclosures 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowance for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding account balances and the overall quality and age of those balances not specifically reviewed 
in determining the provision for invoices not specifically reviewed  we analyze historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
we maintain a large customer base that mitigates the risk of concentration with one customer 
however  approximately of our outstanding receivables are from foreign distributors  which carry a potentially higher degree of risk 
if the overall condition of the health care industry were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of our customers ability to make payments  significant additional allowances could be required 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of accounts receivable allowances  comprised of both allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns  of million and million at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory based on historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions which includes 
table of contents estimates of the impact of the introduction of new or enhanced products on existing inventory 
our industry is characterized by regular new product development  and as such  our inventory is at risk of obsolescence following the introduction and development of new or enhanced products 
our estimate and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our sales forecasts 
future product introductions and related inventories may require additional reserves based upon changes in market demand or introduction of competing technologies 
increases in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding expense to cost of goods sold 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  our excess and obsolete inventory reserves  included approximately million of adjustments for the planned discontinuance of the primus balloon expandable stent and the sailor 
balloon due to our strategic marketing focus on new product introductions 
valuation of acquired in process research and development  goodwill and other intangible assets when we acquire another company  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  between acquired in process research and development  other identifiable intangible assets  tangible net assets and goodwill as required by us gaap 
in process research and development is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development and other intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates that may change over time 
during  we recorded an in process research and development charge of million related to the october  acquisition of foxhollow 
during  we recorded an in process research and development charge of million related to the january  acquisition of the remaining minority interest in mti 
for further discussion see note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the income approach was used to determine the fair values of the acquired in process research and development 
this approach establishes fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to the in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to the present value 
revenue estimates were based on relative market size  expected market growth rates and market share penetration 
gross margin estimates were based on the estimated cost of the product at the time of introduction and historical gross margins for similar products offered by us or by competitors in the marketplace 
the estimated selling  general and administrative expenses were based on historical operating expenses of the acquired company as well as long term expense levels based on industry comparables 
the costs to complete each project were based on estimated direct project expenses as well as the remaining labor hours and related overhead costs 
in arriving at the value of acquired in process research and development projects  we considered each project s stage of completion  the complexity of the work to be completed  the costs already incurred  the remaining costs to complete the project  the contribution of core technologies  the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
the discount rate used to arrive at the present value of acquired in process research and development as of the acquisition date was based on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
we believe that the estimated acquired in process research and development amounts determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets  including in process research and development  of the acquired businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists 
we have not recorded impairment of goodwill in any of the years included in our consolidated statements of operations 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
goodwill was million and million at december  and  respectively 
other intangible assets consist primarily of purchased developed technology  patents  customer relationships and trademarks and are amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
we 
table of contents review these intangible assets for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter or as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value may not be recoverable 
we have not recorded an impairment of other intangible assets in any of the years included in our consolidated statements of operations 
other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the evaluation of asset impairments related to goodwill and other intangible assets  among other things  requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the assets being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in our consolidated statement of operations 
management s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill if and when that portion of the deferred tax asset is realized and the related valuation allowance is reversed 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies when tax benefits should be recorded in financial statements  requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters and indicates how any tax reserves should be classified in a balance sheet 
as a result of this standard  we recorded a charge of  which was accounted for as an increase in the january  balance of accumulated deficit 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised business combinations and sfas no 
non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  these new standards represent the completion of the fasb s first major joint project with the international accounting standards board iasb and are intended to improve  simplify  and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests formerly minority interests in consolidated financial statements 
ev will adopt these standards at the beginning of its fiscal year 
the effect of adoption will generally be prospectively applied to transactions completed after the end of the company s fiscal year  although the new presentation and disclosure requirements for pre existing non controlling interests will be retrospectively applied to all prior period financial information presented 
sfas no 
r retains the underlying fair value concepts of its predecessor sfas no 
 but changes the method for applying the acquisition method in a number of significant respects including the requirement to expense transaction fees and expected restructuring costs as incurred  rather than including these amounts in the allocated purchase price  the requirement to recognize the fair value of contingent consideration at the acquisition date  rather than the expected amount when the contingency is resolved  the requirement to recognize the fair value of acquired in process research and development assets at the acquisition date  rather than immediately expensing  and the requirement to recognize a gain in relation to a 
table of contents bargain purchase price  rather than reducing the allocated basis of long lived assets 
because this standard is generally applied prospectively  the effect of adoption on the company s financial statements will depend primarily on specific transactions  if any  completed after in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurement 
the standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the statement is effective for us beginning in in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp sfas no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp sfas no 
that deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
we do not believe that the implementation of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
on february   the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
creates a fair value option under which an entity may elect to record certain financial assets or liabilities at fair value upon their initial recognition 
subsequent changes in fair value would be recognized in earnings as those changes occur 
the election of the fair value option would be made on a contract by contract basis and would need to be supported by concurrent documentation or a preexisting documented policy 
sfas no 
requires an entity to separately disclose the fair value of these items on the balance sheet or in the footnotes to the financial statements and to provide information that would allow the financial statement user to understand the impact on earnings from changes in the fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning in we do not believe that the implementation of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition

sfas establishes new standards that will govern the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests in partially owned subsidiaries 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
all other requirements shall be applied prospectively 
as of december   we do not have any partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and therefore  we do not expect an impact related to the adoption of this accounting standard 
in june  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf indicates that the presentation of taxes within the scope of this issue on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
our policy is to present the taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and are not material to our results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf that provides guidance for upfront payments related to goods and services of research and development costs 
eitf is effective for us beginning in although the effect of this standard will depend primarily on arrangements existing in specific transactions  we do not believe that the implementation of eitf will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition based on existing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  which are potential losses arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign exchange fluctuations 
we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  however  our policy is to only enter into contracts that can be designated as normal purchases or sales 

table of contents interest rate risk borrowings under our revolving line of credit bear interest at a variable rate equal to svb s prime rate 
borrowings under the equipment line bear interest at a variable rate equal to svb s prime rate plus 
we currently do not use interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
as of december   we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit and had million in borrowings under the equipment line 
based upon this debt level  a increase in the interest rate on such borrowings would cause us to incur an increase in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
at december   cash and short term investments were million 
based on our annualized average interest rate  a decrease in the interest rate on such balances would result in a reduction in interest income of approximately  on an annual basis 
foreign currency exchange rate risk fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial results 
approximately and of our net sales in and  respectively  were denominated in foreign currencies 
although we expect the percentage of net sales denominated in foreign currencies to decrease in compared to as a result of our acquisition of foxhollow  we currently expect that net sales denominated in foreign currencies will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales in the future 
selling  marketing and administrative costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currency  thereby limiting our transaction risk exposure 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases and if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our price not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
approximately and of our net sales denominated in foreign currencies in and  respectively  were derived from european union countries and were denominated in the euro 
additionally  we have significant intercompany receivables from our foreign subsidiaries  which are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the yen 
our principal foreign currency exchange rate risks therefore exist between the us dollar and the euro and between the us dollar and the yen 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated receivables and payables  generating currency transaction gains or losses that impact our non operating income expense levels in the respective period and are reported in other income expense  net in our consolidated financial statements 
we recorded a million foreign currency exchange rate transaction gain in and a million foreign currency exchange rate transaction gain in  related to the translation of our foreign denominated net receivables into us dollars 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we may  however  hedge such exposure to foreign currency exchange rates in the future
