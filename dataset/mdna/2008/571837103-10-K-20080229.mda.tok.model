on november   marshall ilsley corporation accounting predecessor to new marshall ilsley corporation which is referred to as m i or the corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  metavante corporation accounting predecessor to metavante technologies  inc  which is referred to as metavante  became two separate publicly traded companies in accordance with the plan the corporation announced in early april the corporation believes this transaction  which the corporation refers to as the separation will provide substantial benefits to the shareholders of both companies by creating additional opportunities to focus on core businesses 
new marshall ilsley corporation s enhanced capital position is expected to be a source of strength in the current credit environment as well as drive earnings per share growth by enabling it to provide resources for continued organic growth  fund strategic initiatives within its business lines and pursue opportunities in new geographic markets 
as part of the separation  the corporation received capital contributions of  million in cash from metavante  which consisted of a contribution from metavante of  million and proceeds of million from metavante s issuance of a equity interest to wpm lp  an affiliate of warburg pincus llc warburg pincus 
in addition  the corporation received million in repayment of indebtedness that was due from metavante 
in considering the redeployment of the tangible capital generated from the separation  the corporation has established the following priorities prudently invest in the franchise which includes maintaining a strong capital base in the current credit environment  pursue financially disciplined acquisitions in wealth management and banking  and prudently allocate capital to common stock repurchases and to common stock dividends 
as a result of the separation  the assets  liabilities and net income of metavante have been de consolidated from the corporation s historical consolidated financial statements and are now reported as discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income also includes the expenses and the tax free gain that were attributable to the separation transaction 
for accounting purposes only  the investment by warburg pincus in metavante for an equity interest representing of metavante was treated as a sale of of metavante s common stock by the corporation to warburg pincus for cash in the amount of million 
the sale resulted in a tax free gain in the amount of million 
the assets and liabilities reported as discontinued operations do not directly reconcile to historical consolidated assets and liabilities reported by metavante

the decrease in income from continuing operations in compared to was primarily attributable to the increases in the provision for loan and lease losses 
consistent with what many bank holding companies experienced in  the deterioration in the national residential real estate markets had a negative impact on the corporation s loan and lease portfolio 
the corporation s construction and development real estate loans  particularly in arizona and the west coast of florida  exhibited the 
table of contents most dramatic increase in stress and impairment 
as a result  net charge offs and the provision for loan and lease losses were significantly higher in when compared to the corporation s historical experience with net charge offs and the provision for loan and lease losses 
the provision for loan and lease losses amounted to million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
on an after tax basis  the increase in the provision for loan and lease losses in compared to amounted to approximately million or per diluted share 
expenses in include losses associated with two debt terminations  litigation accruals that arose from the corporation s membership interests in visa  inc visa and a donation to support charitable works in the communities within the corporation s markets 
in the aggregate  these expense and loss items amounted to approximately million and resulted in a decrease to income from continuing operations of million or per diluted share 
organic loan and bank issued deposit growth  the two banking acquisitions completed in and a full year of the two banking acquisitions completed in contributed to the growth in net interest income and other banking sources of revenues 
continued growth in assets under management and assets under administration and acquisitions resulted in solid growth in fee income for wealth management 
increased investment securities gains and gains from branch sales were somewhat offset by lower mortgage banking revenue in income from continuing operations in amounted to million or per diluted share compared to income from continuing operations in of million or per diluted share  and increase of million or per diluted share 
the increase in income from continuing operations in compared to was attributable to a number of factors 
the increase in net interest income was due to strong organic loan and bank issued deposit growth and the contribution from two banking acquisitions that were completed on april  net charge offs were below the corporation s five year historical average in growth in assets under management and assets under administration and acquisitions resulted in continued growth in fee income for wealth management 
although an unpredictable source of earnings  investment securities gains were million lower in compared to income from continuing operations for the year ended december   includes the impact of the mark to market adjustments associated with certain interest rate swaps 
the impact  which is reported as net derivative losses discontinued hedges in the consolidated statements of income  resulted in a decrease to income from continuing operations of million or per diluted share in these factors  along with continued expense management  all contributed to the growth in income from continuing operations in with regard to the outlook in  management expects that  even with the benefit of the cash received from metavante  continued pricing competition for loan products  increased funding costs and the elevated levels of nonperforming loans make it more likely that modest net interest margin compression will continue 
commercial and industrial loan growth is expected to show mid single digit growth rates 
commercial real estate growth is expected to be in the mid single digit percentage range 
wealth management revenue is expected to show high single digit to low double digit growth rates depending on market volatility and direction 
with respect to credit quality  management expects will continue to be a difficult year for residential real estate markets 
management expects the provision for loan and lease losses will continue to be higher than its pre historical experience and estimates that the provision for loan and lease losses will be in the range of million to million per quarter in as the corporation works toward the resolution of its nonperforming loans and leases  the provision for loan and lease losses could exceed management s expectations in any quarter or quarters in should real estate markets deteriorate more than management currently expects  the corporation would experience increased levels of nonperforming assets  increased net charge offs  a higher provision for loan and lease losses  lower net interest income and increased operating costs due to the expense associated with collection efforts and the operating expense of carrying nonperforming assets 
there are however  numerous unknown factors at this time that will ultimately affect the timing and amount of nonperforming assets  net charge offs and the provision for loan and lease losses that will be recognized in

an increased number of originations with selected credit  rate and term characteristics were retained on balance sheet in management expects that the corporation will continue to retain originations that meet its qualifications on balance sheet in the near term 
the corporation sells some of its residential real estate loan production residential real estate and home equity loans in the secondary market 
as previously discussed  selected residential real estate loans with credit  rate and term characteristics that are considered desirable are periodically retained in the portfolio 
residential real estate loans originated and sold to the secondary market amounted to billion in compared to billion in at december   residential mortgage loans held for sale amounted to million compared to million at december  the housing market and the decline in the national investor base adversely affected the origination for sale business in gains from the sale of mortgage loans amounted to million in compared to million in the corporation has more recently seen some renewed investor interest for home equity loans and lines  although it is difficult to assess how that will affect the origination for sale business in the sub prime mortgage banking environment has been experiencing considerable strain from rising delinquencies and liquidity pressures and some sub prime lenders have failed 
the increased scrutiny of the sub prime lending market is one of the factors that have impacted general market conditions as well as perceptions of the mortgage origination business 
the corporation considers sub prime loans to be those loans with high loan to value  temporary below market interest rates  which are sometimes referred to as teaser rates  or interest deferral options at the time of origination and credit scores that are less than the corporation believes that loans with these characteristics have contributed to the high levels of foreclosures and losses the industry is currently experiencing 
the corporation does not originate sub prime mortgages or sub prime home equity loans or lines 
however  the corporation may have loss exposure from loans to entities that are associated with sub prime mortgage banking 
the corporation does not originate mortgage loans with variable interest only payment plans  commonly referred to as option arms 
option arms may include low introductory interest plans with significant escalation in the rate when the agreement calls for the rate to reset 
the borrower may also be able to fix the monthly payment amount  potentially resulting in negative amortization of the loan 
the corporation does not originate mortgage loans that permit negative amortization 
a negative amortization provision in a mortgage allows the borrower to defer payment of a portion or all of the monthly interest accrued on the mortgage and to add the deferred interest amount to the mortgage s principal balance subject to a stated maximum permitted amount of negative amortization 
once the maximum permitted amount of negative amortization is reached  the borrowers monthly payment is reset and is usually significantly higher than the monthly payment made during periods of negative amortization 
the corporation does participate in the alt a market 
the corporation s alt a products are offered to borrowers with higher credit scores and lower loan to value ratios who choose the convenience of less than full documentation in exchange for higher reserve requirements and a higher mortgage rate

average organic noninterest bearing deposits declined billion in compared to noninterest deposit balances tend to exhibit some seasonality with a trend of balances declining somewhat in the early part of the year followed by growth in balances throughout the remainder of the year 
a portion of the noninterest balances  especially commercial balances  is sensitive to the interest rate environment 
larger balances tend to be maintained when overall interest rates are low and smaller balances tend to be maintained as overall interest rates increase 
the corporation has increasingly been able to competitively price deposit products which has contributed to the growth in average interest bearing bank issued deposits and average bank issued time deposits 
the bank issued deposit mix continued to shift in in their search for higher yields  both new and existing customers have been migrating their deposit balances to higher cost money market and time deposit products 
wholesale deposits are funds in the form of deposits generated through distribution channels other than the corporation s own banking branches 
the corporation continues to make use of wholesale funding alternatives

average wholesale deposits increased billion in compared to average wholesale deposits in include billion of average wholesale deposits that were assumed in the banking acquisition 
total borrowings increased billion and amounted to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the increase was primarily attributable to short term borrowings 
the increased use of short term borrowings reflects  in part  the widening of credit spreads and general lack of demand by investors for longer term bank debt that was prevalent during the second half of during the first quarter of  the corporation called the million junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures and the related m i capital trust a trust preferred securities 
this transaction resulted in a loss of million that is reported in losses on termination of debt in the consolidated statements of income and was primarily due to the contractual call premium paid to retire the debentures and trust preferred securities 
during the third quarter of  million of floating rate federal home loan bank fhlb advances were extinguished and the pay fixed receive floating interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges on the fhlb advances were terminated 
the gain realized from these transactions was primarily due to the acceleration of the fair value adjustments for the interest rate swaps that were recorded in other comprehensive income 
that gain amounted to million and is reported in the other line of other income in the consolidated statements of income 
also during the third quarter of  the corporation remarketed the stacks of m i capital trust b and issued million of senior notes of the corporation that mature on august  in exchange for the stacks 
as a result of the illiquid market and prohibitive cost of remarketing  the billion purs were terminated in the fourth quarter of the loss which  was primarily the cost of purchasing the right to remarket the purs through  amounted to million and is reported in losses on termination of debt in the consolidated statements of income

the cost of interest bearing liabilities was in compared to in  an increase of basis points 

table of contents like the industry in general  there were many factors that presented a challenge to the corporation s net interest margin in some of these factors included the movement of new and existing deposits into higher yielding products  loan growth that exceeded the corporation s ability to generate lower cost deposits  an interest rate environment characterized by an inverted yield curve  higher credit spreads and liquidity premiums for term financing and elevated levels of nonaccrual loans 
the cash received from metavante was beneficial to net interest income and the net interest margin  although that benefit was realized for only two months in acquisitions for cash and common share repurchases reduced net interest income and were additional sources of contraction to the net interest margin 
management continues to believe that margin contraction is more likely than margin expansion 
as a result  the net interest margin fte as a percent of average earning assets could continue to have modest downward pressure in the near term 
net interest income and the net interest margin percentage can vary and continue to be influenced by loan and deposit growth  product spreads  pricing competition in the corporation s markets  prepayment activity  future interest rate changes  levels of nonaccrual loans and various other factors

nonperforming loans and leases consist of nonaccrual  troubled debt restructured loans which the corporation refers as renegotiated  and loans and leases that are delinquent days or more and still accruing interest 
the balance of nonperforming loans and leases are affected by acquisitions and may be subject to fluctuation based on the timing of cash collections  renegotiations and renewals 
generally  loans that are days or more past due as to interest or principal are placed on nonaccrual 
exceptions to these rules are generally only for loans fully collateralized by readily marketable securities or other relatively risk free collateral 
in addition  a loan may be placed on nonaccrual when management makes a determination that the facts and circumstances warrant such classification irrespective of the current payment status 
maintaining nonperforming assets at an acceptable level is important to the ongoing success of a financial services institution 
the corporation employs a comprehensive credit review and approval process to help ensure that the amount of nonperforming assets on a long term basis is minimized within the overall framework of acceptable levels of credit risk 
in addition to the negative impact on net interest income and credit losses  nonperforming assets also increase operating costs due to the expense associated with collection efforts and the expenses of carrying oreo 
the corporation had a significant increase in nonperforming assets and past due loans and leases in compared to the corporation has been aggressive to isolate  identify and assess its underlying loan and lease portfolio credit quality and has developed and continues to develop strategies to reduce its loss exposure

at december  the composition of oreo was million in construction and land development properties  million in family residential real estate properties and million in commercial real estate properties

the corporation s construction and development real estate loans exhibited the most dramatic increase in impairment 
in addition  loans whose performance is dependent on the housing market  such as the franklin loan discussed above  were adversely affected by the deterioration in the national residential real estate markets 
deteriorating conditions in the us housing market became evident in the first half of and accelerated sharply in the second half of the year 
housing starts reached a year low in september after being at a year high in early faced with these deteriorating conditions  some borrowers have been unable to either refinance or sell their properties and consequently have defaulted or are very close to defaulting on their loans 
in a stressed housing market with increasing delinquencies and declining real estate values  such as currently exists  the adequacy of collateral securing the loan becomes a much more important factor in determining expected loan performance 
the corporation intensified its credit reviews in the current higher risk segments within its real estate portfolio 
these reviews included re assessing the timeliness and propriety of appraisals for collateral dependent loans especially in volatile real estate markets such as the west coast of florida and arizona 
in addition  the corporation re evaluated the expected timing and amount of expected cash flows required to service debt under various scenarios for both nonperforming loans and performing loans that were considered to be at a higher risk of going into nonperforming status 
in many cases  declining real estate values resulted in the determination that the collateral was insufficient to cover the recorded investment in the loan 
for the year ended december   these factors resulted in the corporation s loan and lease portfolio experiencing significantly higher incidences of default and a significant increase in loss severity

the provisions for loan and lease losses are the amounts required to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses at the required level after considering charge offs and recoveries

the corporation believes that its risk at the individual loan level remains manageable and has developed and continues to develop strategies to mitigate its loss exposure 
if the real estate market does not improve or continues to deteriorate  the corporation expects the levels of nonaccrual loans and leases and oreo will continue to increase in construction and development loans tend to be more complex and may take more time to attain a satisfactory resolution 
depending on the facts and circumstances  acquiring real estate collateral in partial or total satisfaction of problem loans may continue to be the best course of action to take in order to mitigate the corporation s exposure to loss 
management expects the provision for loan and lease losses in will continue to be higher than its pre historical experience would imply and estimates that a provision for loan and lease losses in the range of million to million per quarter may be appropriate in as the corporation works towards the resolution of its nonperforming loans and leases  the provision for loan and lease losses could exceed management s expectations in any quarter or quarters in the volatility in the housing markets  general economic conditions and numerous other unknown factors at this time will ultimately determine the timing and amount of net charge offs and provision for loan and lease losses recognized in and those amounts could be significantly different than management s current expectations
