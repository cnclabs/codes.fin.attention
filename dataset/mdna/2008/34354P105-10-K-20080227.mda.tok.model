please see risk factors and forward looking statements sections for a discussion of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements 
unless otherwise noted  all amounts discussed herein are consolidated 
executive overview we are an established industry leader with a strong product portfolio of pumps  valves  seals  automation and aftermarket services in support of global infrastructure industries including oil and gas  chemical  power generation and water management  as well as general industrial markets where our products add value 
our products are integral to the movement  control and protection of the flow of materials in our customers critical processes 
our business model is influenced by the capital spending of these industries for the placement of new products into service and aftermarket services for existing operations 
the worldwide installed base of our products is an important source of aftermarket revenue  where products are expected to ensure the maximum operating time of many key industrial processes 
the aftermarket business includes parts  service solutions  product life cycle solutions and other value added services  and is generally a higher margin business and a key component to our profitable growth 
we have experienced favorable conditions in in all of our focus industries  especially oil and gas 
market pricing for crude oil and natural gas  in particular  has supported increased capital investment in the oil and gas market  resulting in many new projects and expansion opportunities 
favorable market conditions have resulted in corresponding growth  much of which is in the developing areas of the world where new oil and gas reserves are under development 
we have seen a particular increase in investment in complex recovery reserves such as tar sands  deepwater and heavy oil where our products are well positioned 
we believe the outlook for our business remains favorable  however  we believe that oil and gas prices will fluctuate in the future and such volatility could have a negative impact on our business in some or all of the geographical areas in which we conduct business 
we continue to execute on our strategy to increase our presence in all regions of the global market to capture aftermarket business through the current installed base  as well as to secure new capital projects and process plant expansions 
the opportunity to increase our installed base of new products and drive recurring aftermarket business in future years is a critical by product of the favorable market conditions we have seen 
although we have experienced strong demand for our products and services in recent periods  we face challenges affecting many companies in our industry with a significant multinational presence  such as economic  political and other risks 
we currently employ approximately  employees in more than countries who are focused on key strategies that reach across the business 
see our strategies section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a for a discussion of our key strategies 
we continue to build on our geographic breadth through the implementation of additional quick response centers qrcs with the goal to be positioned as near to the customers as possible for service and support in order to capture this important aftermarket business 
along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell  install and service our equipment in remote regions  it becomes equally imperative to continuously improve our global operations 
our global supply chain capability is being expanded to meet global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our products 
significant efforts are underway to reduce the supply base and drive processes across our divisions to find areas of synergy and cost reduction 
in addition  we are improving our supply chain management capability to ensure it can meet global customer demands 
we continue to focus on improving on time delivery and quality  while reducing warranty costs as a percentage of sales across our global operations through a focused continuous improvement process cip initiative 
the goal of the cip and lean manufacturing initiatives are to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on time delivery  reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity 
this program is a key factor in our margin expansion plans 
recent developments as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  annual report  a number of putative class action lawsuits were filed against us  certain of our former officers  our independent auditors and the lead underwriters of our most recent 
table of contents public stock offerings  alleging securities laws violations 
by orders dated november  and january   the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of us and all other defendants on all of the plaintiffs claims 
the trial court also denied the plaintiffs request for class certification 
we strongly believe that any appeal or other effort by the plaintiffs to overturn the trial court s denial of class certification or entry of judgment would be without merit  and intend to oppose any such effort vigorously 
additionally  on january   the court entered an order granting our motion to dismiss all claims under a related shareholder derivative lawsuit that was originally filed on march  and allowed the plaintiffs an opportunity to replead 
a notice of entry of the dismissal order was served on the plaintiffs on january  we have resolved investigations by the securities and exchange commission sec and the department of justice doj relating to products that two of our foreign subsidiaries delivered to iraq from through under the united nations oil for food program 
we negotiated a settlement with the sec in which  without admitting or denying the sec s allegations  we agreed to i a stipulated judgment enjoining us from future violations of the internal control and recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws  ii pay disgorgement of  plus prejudgment interest of  and iii pay a civil money penalty of million 
separately  we negotiated a resolution with doj 
the resolution results in a deferred prosecution agreement under which we will pay a monetary penalty of business overview our company we believe that we are a world leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems 
we develop and manufacture precision engineered flow control equipment such as pumps  valves and seals  for critical service applications that require high reliability 
we use our manufacturing platform to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services such as installation  advanced diagnostics  repair and retrofitting 
operations are conducted through three business segments that are referenced throughout this md a flowserve pump division fpd engineered and industrial pumps  pump systems  submersible motors and related services  flow control division fcd engineered and industrial valves  control valves  actuators  controls and related services  and flow solutions division fsd mechanical seals  auxiliary systems and parts and related services 
our product portfolio is built on more than well respected brand names such as worthington  idp  valtek  limitorque  and durametallic 
this portfolio is believed to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry 
the products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more than  companies  including some of the world s leading engineering and construction firms  original equipment manufacturers  distributors and end users 
our markets our products and services are used in several distinct industries oil and gas  chemical  power generation and water management  as well as a number of other industries that are collectively refer to as general industries 
demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers 
the level of capital expenditures depends  in turn  on capital infrastructure projects driven by the need for oil and gas  power and water  as well as general economic conditions 
these are related to the phase of the cycle in their industries and the expectations of future market behavior 
the levels of maintenance spend are driven by the reliability of the equipment  planned downtime for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process 
the oil and gas industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
high petroleum prices generally drove additional investment in upstream exploration and production petroleum projects and significantly contributed to the increase in bookings 
many of these projects were in asia  africa  the middle east and latin america and reflect opportunities with national  international and other major oil companies 
based on the current and future expectations of oil and gas price levels as compared with historical 
table of contents levels  oil and gas companies are encouraged to evaluate new resources and technologies and explore different options such as oil sands  deepwater  heavy oil and the arctic region 
in the downstream segment of the industry refining and transportation  we experienced increased investment in due to a greater global demand for larger amounts of refined products stimulated by the rapid economic growth in developing countries and general demand growth in the rest of the world 
the available refining capacity is not adequate to meet the current demand growth forecasts for the developing markets like china and india 
the refineries are additionally pressured by new clean fuel regulations  which result in activities such as revamps and upgrades to address these environmental concerns 
these situations have been positive for our products as oil and gas companies try to address the supply to the market with increased capacity and the right quality of products to meet tightening regulations 
the outlook for this segment of the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the demand growth from the developing geographies 
the chemical industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
even with the increase in oil feedstock  this industry has been able to pass along price increases for their products  allowing profitability among major chemical companies to maintain levels supportive of capital investment 
in the north american market  the weakness of the dollar has provided a platform of global competitiveness for domestically based chemical companies 
this demand has driven increased capital investments to upgrade facilities and expand output capacity 
the investment in new manufacturing facilities in china has also contributed to the growth in this industry 
although the global chemical industry is in a more mature phase of its cycle  output growth predictions provided by independent third parties for are modestly higher than for as for the emerging field of biotechnologies  we are seeing increased investments for pilot operations and research to bring these alternative products to market 
we are currently working with key customers in this area in the development of products to serve this future industry 
the outlook for the chemical industry remains favorable on a global scale  however  regional economic slowdowns and exchange rate changes could have an adverse impact on this industry in the respective markets 
the power industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
this industry continued to see capital investment growth due the increased power demands in the developing countries such as china and india and capacity increases in mature markets including the united states us 
many of the projects in were designed as coal fired power plants due to the increasing costs of natural gas and the long lead time for clean coal and nuclear 
the revenue opportunity from sales of our products at a coal fired plant typically can be three times that of a natural gas power plant 
planned investments in nuclear power generators increased over the past year with a significant increase in proposed power plant projects 
in the us  more than submittals to the nuclear regulatory commission are expected for new nuclear power plants 
china is projected to develop projects to bring on line as many as two nuclear plants per year for the next years  according to government sources 
our product offerings have maintained n stamp certification required for nuclear applications through the slowdown in nuclear power plant construction allowing us to continue to support the aftermarket business for existing facilities 
this positions us well for the pending growth in investment in nuclear globally 
we are seeing increased activity in alternative energy sources such as geothermal and coal gasification where we are working with key customers in the development of products to serve this portion of the power industry 
the outlook for the power industry is favorable due to the increasing power demand in the developing countries and infrastructure improvements needed in the mature markets 
however  economic slowdowns or recessions could delay the demand for additional power pushing major capital projects out into the future 
worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continues to create requirements for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems  many of which require products that we offer  especially pumps 
we believe we are a global leader in the desalination market  which is an important source of fresh water in the mediterranean area and the middle east 
we expect that this trend in desalination will expand from the traditional areas  as previously mentioned  to other coastal areas around the globe 
this is a significant market for pump and valve actuation products 
in both and  the water market represented approximately of our bookings 
general industries comprises a variety of different businesses  including mining and ore processing  pulp and paper  food and beverage and other smaller applications  none of which individually represents more than of total bookings in and general industries also includes sales to distributors  whose end customers operate 
table of contents in the industries we primarily serve 
general industries represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
in  we saw favorable growth in these businesses with the mining and ore processing industry showing increased investment 
this portion of our business tends to have stable performance due to the diversity of industries and their respective different business cycles 
our customers include engineering contractors  original equipment manufacturers  end users and distributors 
sales to engineering contractors and original equipment manufacturers are typically for large project orders and critical applications  as are certain sales to distributors 
project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly through contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects 
the quick turnaround business  which we also refer to as the book and ship business  is defined as orders that are received from the customer booked and shipped within three months of receipt 
these orders are typically for more standard products  parts or services 
each of our three business segments generates certain levels of this type of business 
in the sale of aftermarket products and services  we benefit from a large installed base of our pumps  seals and valves  which require maintenance  repair and replacement parts 
we use our manufacturing platform to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services such as installation  advanced diagnostics  repair and retrofitting 
in geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick response  we believe customers have traditionally relied on us  rather than our competitors  for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products 
however  the aftermarket for standard products is competitive with common standards providing easier replacement of the installed products 
proximity of service centers  timeliness of delivery and quality are important considerations for aftermarket products and services 
therefore we continue to expand our global qrc network to improve our ability to capture this important aftermarket business 
the reporting of trends by product type  customer type and business type is based upon analytical review of individual operational results and knowledge of their respective businesses  as we do not formally track revenues by any of these categories 
these trends are analyzed as a secondary reporting mechanism that is not derived directly from our general ledger system 
our strategies our overarching objective is to grow our position as a product and integrated solutions provider in the flow control industry 
this objective includes continuing to sell products by building on existing sales relationships and marketing the power of our portfolio of products and services 
it also includes delivering specific end user solutions that help customers attain their business goals by ensuring maximum reliability at a decreased cost of ownership 
sustainable  profitable growth is being driven using strategies that are well communicated throughout our company 
these strategies include organic growth  globalization  process excellence  portfolio management and strategic acquisitions  organizational capability and technology innovation 
the key elements of these strategies are outlined below 
organic growth organic growth is an important initiative focused on growing revenues from the existing portfolio of products and services  as well as through the development of new customer driven products and services 
an overarching goal is to focus on opportunities that can maximize the organic growth from existing customers and to evaluate potential new customer partnering initiatives that maximize the capture of the product s total life cycle 
we are one of the few pump  valve and seal companies that can offer customers a differentiated option of products and services  as well as offer an additional option that includes any combination of products and solution support packages across a broad portfolio 
the combined pump and seal end user teams have historically been successful in delivering new solution programs and increasing organic aftermarket growth 
we seek to capture additional market share by creating mutually beneficial opportunities for us and our customers through sourcing and maintenance alliance programs pursuant to which we provide all or an agreed portion of customers parts and servicing needs 
these customer alliances enable us to develop long term professional relationships with our customers and serve as an effective platform for introducing new products and services to our customers and generating additional sales 

table of contents we also seek to continue to review our substantial installed pump  seal and valve base as a means to expand the aftermarket services business  as customers are increasingly using third party aftermarket service providers to reduce their fixed costs and improve profitability 
to date  the aftermarket services business has provided us with a steady source of revenues and cash flows at higher margins than original equipment sales 
this allows us to be in frequent contact with customers  building on the knowledge of customer needs and providing cross selling opportunities 
we are building on our established presence through an extensive qrc global network to provide the immediate parts  service and technical support required to effectively manage and win the aftermarket business created from our installed base 
new product and service development is driven through our product management organization  working in concert with engineering  operations and sales 
the goal is to increase our revenues from new products and services developed during the last five years

globalization the globalization business initiative has several facets that include expanding our global presence to capture business in the developing geographic market areas china  russia  latin america  middle east and africa  utilizing low cost sourcing opportunities to remain competitive in the global economy  and attracting and retaining the global intellectual capital required to support our global growth plans in new geographical areas 
we believe there are attractive opportunities in international markets  particularly in latin america  the middle east and asia pacific and intend to continue to utilize our global presence to further penetrate these markets 
in  we signed a joint venture agreement with changsha pump works in china to focus on the growing power and water industries in china 
in the aftermarket services business  we seek to strategically add qrcs sites in order to provide rapid response  fast delivery and onsite field repair on a global scale for our customers 
in  we added four qrcs expanding our ability to effectively deliver aftermarket support globally 
of particular note  we broke ground on a new qrc campus in dubai located in the jebel ali free trade zone 
this facility will support aftermarket requirements for all three product divisions in the middle east region 
we are focused on shifting  as appropriate  certain manufacturing and engineering functions to  and increasing the supply of materials and components from  lower cost areas such as india  china  mexico  latin america and eastern europe 
in these areas accounted for approximately of our direct materials spending  compared to approximately in we are focused on utilizing supply chain management to reduce procurement costs  including expanding purchases utilizing e commerce and further consolidating the procurement of goods at a better value 
in addition  we have expanded our china presence with additional sales and supply chain professionals and growth plans 
these growth plans include acquisition or development of new capabilities that will enhance the penetration of products in china for oil and gas and power projects  as well as provide a base for the export of products 
process excellence the process excellence initiative encapsulates ongoing programs that drive increased customer fulfillment and yield internal productivity 
this initiative includes driving improved customer fulfillment through metrics such as on time delivery  cost reduction  quality  cycle time reduction and warranty cost reduction as a percentage of sales  continuing to develop a culture of continuous improvement that delivers maximum productivity and cost efficiencies  and implementing global functional competencies to drive standardized processes 

table of contents we seek to increase our operational efficiency through our cip initiative  which utilizes tools such as six sigma methodology  lean manufacturing and capacity management to improve quality and processes  reduce product cycle times and lower costs 
recognizing that employees are our most valuable resource in achieving operational excellence goals  we have instituted broad cip training 
to date  more than  employees are cip trained or certified as green belts or black belts and are deployed on cip projects throughout our company in operations and the front office of the business 
as a result of the cip initiatives  we have developed and implemented processes to reduce our engineering and manufacturing process cycle time  improve on time delivery and service response time  lower inventory levels and reduce costs 
we have also experienced success in sharing and applying best practices achieved in one business segment and deploying those ideas to other segments of the business 
we continue to make progress in standardizing processes and simplifying our information technology platform 
standard processes have been designed and agreed to by our manufacturing  supply chain  sales and service and finance departments  creating a standard blueprint for our company 
we continue to implement these processes using a common enterprise resource planning erp software platform 
since  we have successfully reduced our overall erp footprint from platforms to platforms excluding the impact of platform reductions resulting from dispositions 
we seek to continue to improve our working capital utilization  with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory 
see further discussion in the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
portfolio management and strategic acquisitions the continued management of our portfolio of products and services is critical to our success 
we will continue to rationalize our portfolio of products and services to ensure alignment with market requirements 
we will continue to make the necessary research and development r d investments to expand the scope of our product offerings and our deployment of advanced technologies 
we will also continue to evaluate acquisitions  joint ventures and other strategic investment opportunities to broaden our product portfolio  service capabilities  geographic presence or operational capabilities to meet the growing needs of our customers 
in  we sold non core assets related to the rail business of our wholly owned australian subsidiary  thompsons  kelly and lewis  pty 
ltd 
tkl 
the tkl rail assets were a part of our larger australian pump business 
the tkl pump business was retained and remains a core part of our business 
organizational capability we believe there are several elements in our strategic efforts to continuously enhance our organizational capability  including building our succession planning along with our competency and performance management capabilities  with a focus on key positions and critical talent pools  utilizing these capabilities to drive our training programs and facilitate our cross divisional and functional development assignments  developing talent acquisition programs to address critical talent needs to support our global growth  capturing the intellectual capital in the current workforce and sharing it within our company and with customers as a competitive advantage  creating a total compensation program that provides our associates with equitable opportunities that are competitive and linked to performance  and building a diversified organization with a strong ethical and compliance culture based on transparency and trust 
we continue to focus on training through the distribution of electronic learning packages in multiple languages for our code of business conduct  workplace harassment  facility safety  anti bribery and foreign corrupt practices act  export compliance and other regulatory and compliance programs 
in addition  in we launched a new rotating equipment specialist program aimed at capturing internal intellectual capital and improving the capabilities of the internal workforce in an effort to provide better service to our customers 
this is a comprehensive program 
table of contents that will continue through and with the goal of educating more than  of our front line employees across the globe 
technology innovation the infusion of advanced technologies into new product and services development has become a core requirement as we evaluate our r d investments 
the objective is to improve the percentage of new products as a function of revenue  utilizing technological innovation to improve overall product lifecycle management and total cost of ownership for our customers 
a cross divisional technology council is in place to explore new technologies and their potential applications in our industry 
the team also has the objective of ensuring that the technologies developed are available for wide use across our company to maximize the return on investments 
one major focus of applying advanced technology is in adding self diagnostic capabilities into our products 
this includes the intelligence required to provide customers with advanced warning of required maintenance  allowing their operations to reach optimal productivity 
we are teaming with universities and experts in the appropriate research fields to accelerate the required learning and to shorten the development time in leveraging the value of applied technologies in our products and services 
our intent is to be a market leader in the application of advanced technology to improve product performance and return on investment for our customers

the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations and certain us non deductible expenses 

table of contents the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to extraterritorial income eti exclusion benefits of million  state income tax benefits of million resulting primarily from net reductions in valuation allowances and million of net tax impact from foreign operations 
we have operations in european and asian countries that provide various tax incentives 
in  we were granted a preferential tax rate of approximately in switzerland for certain sales and marketing activities 
this incentive did not provide a benefit after during  we received a year  tax rate in singapore for income in excess of a prescribed base amount generated from certain regional headquarter activities  subject to certain employment and investment requirements 
in india  we were granted tax exemptions for profits derived from export sales and certain manufacturing operations in prescribed areas for a period of years 
the indian tax exemptions expire in and  respectively 
on may   the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of was signed into law  creating an exclusion from us taxable income for certain types of foreign related party payments of dividends  interest  rents  and royalties which  prior to  have been subject to us taxation 
this exclusion is effective for the years through  and applies to certain of our related party payments 
our effective tax rate is based upon current earnings and estimates of future taxable earnings for each domestic and international location 
changes in any of these and other factors  including our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating losses or results from tax audits  could impact the tax rate in future periods 
as of december  we have foreign tax credits of million  expiring in through against which we recorded million in valuation allowances 
additionally  we have recorded other us net deferred tax assets of million  which relate to net operating losses  tax credits and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods  most of which do not have a definite expiration 
should we not be able to utilize all or a portion of these credits and losses  our effective tax rate would be negatively impacted 
it is reasonably possible that within the next months the effective tax rate will be impacted by the resolution of some or all of the matters audited by various taxing authorities 
we estimate we could record a reduction in our tax expense of approximately million to million within the next months 
net earnings and earnings per share amounts in millions income from continuing operations net earnings net earnings per share from continuing operations diluted net earnings per share diluted average diluted shares net earnings in includes a gain of million from discontinued operations  representing the reduction in the loss on the sale of gsg as a result of the resolution of the contingent sales price 
net earnings in includes a million loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  is due primarily to the impairment of certain assets owned by gsg  which is more fully discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
income from continuing operations in increased by million to million  or per diluted share  as compared with the increase is primarily attributable to the million increase in operating income  partially offset by the million increase in tax expense  as discussed above

 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
we consider accounting for retirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  retirement  turnover  health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding 
plan description we and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full time and part time employees 
the defined benefit pension plan in the us is the flowserve corporation pension plan and the defined contribution plan in the us is the flowserve corporation retirement savings plan 
approximately of total defined benefit pension plan assets and of benefit obligations are related to the us plan as of december  the assets for the us plan are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation 
unless specified otherwise  the references in this section are to total plans ie  the ie plan together with international plans 
benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of credited service and on participants compensation 
assets under our defined benefit pension plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities 
at december   the estimated fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit plans increased to million from million at december  assets were allocated as follows us plan us plans asset category equity securities fixed income other the projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the estimated prior service benefit for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into pension expense in is million 
the estimated net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into pension expense in is million 
none of our common stock is directly held by these plans 
we sponsor a defined benefit postretirement health care plan covering most current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the us this plan provides for medical and dental benefits and is administered through insurance companies 
we fund the plan as benefits are paid  such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented 
accordingly  we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets 
the benefits under the plan are not available to new employees or most existing employees 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for our defined benefit postretirement health care plan was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
accrual accounting and significant assumptions consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 we account for pension benefits using the accrual method  recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees 
the accrual method of accounting for pension benefits necessarily requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 

table of contents our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase  and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we  in consultation with our actuaries  evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension benefits  such as discount rate  expected return on plan assets for funded plans  life expectancy of participants and assumed rate of wage increases  and determine such assumptions as of december of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year 
depending on the assumptions used  the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding 
actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors 
the assumed discount rate used for determining future pension obligations is based on indices of aa rated corporate bonds  except for one foreign location  which uses government bonds 
the assumed rate of compensation increase used for determining future pension obligations reflects an estimate of the change in actual future compensation levels due to general price levels  productivity  seniority and other factors 
the expected long term rate of return on assets was determined by assessing the rates of return for each targeted asset class and return premiums generated by active portfolio management 
in  net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in income from continuing operations was million compared with million in and million in the postretirement benefit gain expense for the postretirement health care plan was million in compared with million in and million in the following are assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans for the year ended december  us plan us plans weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels weighted average assumptions used to determine net cost long term rate of return on assets discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels the following provides a sensitivity analysis of alternative assumptions on the us qualified and aggregate us pension plans and us postretirement plans

at december   we increased our assumed discount rate for the us plan from to consistent with increased year bond yields and our average rate for non us plans from to 
we maintained our average assumed rate of compensation increase at for the us plan 
we increased the expected rate of return on us plan assets from for to for  primarily to reflect expected long term equity returns 
we expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be million lower in than the million in  reflecting  among other things  the increase in the assumed discount rate 
we expect the expense for the postretirement health care plan to be million 
we have used the same assumed discount rates of and at december  and  respectively  in calculating our cost of pension benefits and our cost of other postretirement benefits for us plans 
the assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in per capita health care costs were for  for and for  with a gradual decrease to for and future years 
if actual costs are higher than those assumed  this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care 
plan funding our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs 
we contributed million  million and million to our defined benefit plans in  and  respectively 
in  we expect to contribute approximately million to our qualified us pension plan  and we expect to contribute approximately million to our non us pension plans 
on august   president bush signed into law the pension protection act of the ppa 
among other things  the ppa established minimum funding standards for defined benefit plans for plan years beginning after and provided for accelerated vesting of employer contributions to defined contribution plans beginning in for further discussions on retirement benefits  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
our critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions  including our historical experience  where relevant 
the most significant estimates made by management include  timing and amount of revenue recognition  deferred taxes  tax valuation allowances and tax reserves  reserves for contingent losses  retirement and postretirement benefits  and valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets 
the significant estimates are reviewed 
table of contents quarterly by management with oversight by our disclosure control committee  an internal committee comprised of members of senior management  and the disclosure control committee presents its views to the audit committee of our board of directors 
because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements  actual results may differ from the estimates  and the difference may be material 
our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition revenues for product sales are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customers  which is based on the contractual delivery terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions 
in addition  our policy requires persuasive evidence of an arrangement  a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectibility 
for contracts containing multiple elements  each having a determinable fair value  we recognize revenue in an amount equal to the element s pro rata share of the contract s fair value in accordance with the contractual delivery terms for each element 
freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
revenues for long term contracts  which include contracts that exceed certain internal thresholds regarding the size and duration of the project and provide for the receipt of progress billings from the customer  are recorded on the percentage of completion method with progress measured on a cost to cost basis 
percentage of completion revenue represents less than of our consolidated sales in revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered 
revenues generated under fixed fee service and repair contracts are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the contract 
these contracts can range in duration  but generally extend for up to five years 
fixed fee service contracts represent less than of our consolidated sales in in certain instances  we provide guaranteed completion dates under the terms of our contracts 
failure to meet contractual delivery dates can result in late delivery penalties or non recoverable costs 
in instances where the payment of such costs are deemed to be probable  we perform a project profitability analysis accounting for such costs as a reduction of realizable revenues  which could potentially cause estimated total project costs to exceed projected total revenues realized from the project 
in such instances  we would record reserves to cover such excesses in the period they are determined  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in circumstances where the total projected reduced revenues still exceed total projected costs  the incurrence of unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs generally reduces profitability of the project at the time of subsequent revenue recognition 
our reported results would change if different estimates were used for contract costs or if different estimates were used for contractual contingencies 
deferred taxes  tax valuation allowances and tax reserves we recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for us and non us subsidiaries  and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of these allowances  if necessary 
we assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 
implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could  if successful  result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances 

table of contents the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
we establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities 
the consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate 
on january   we adopted fin no 
 which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin no 
 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
the determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters  and our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities 
to the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes  such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
reserves for contingent loss liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable 
assessments of reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in house experts  including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations 
the recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter  changes in political environments  legal venue and other factors 
recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties  technological innovation and regulatory environment changes 
retirement and postretirement benefits determination of the value of our retirement and postretirement benefits liabilities is based on actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions that are assessed annually in the fourth quarter and which include discount rates  expected return on plan assets for funded plans  life expectancy of participants  assumed rate of wage increases  and assumed rate of health care cost increases 
we evaluate  in conjunction with our professional advisors  prevailing market conditions in countries where plans are maintained  including appropriate rates of return  interest rates and medical inflation rates 
specifically for our us plan  we assess such market factors as changes in the cash balance interest crediting rate  borrowing rates for investment grade corporate and industrial companies  assumptions used by fortune companies  our actual wage increases in recent years  expected rates of return for each targeted asset class held by the plans and return premiums generated by active investment management 
for the non us plans we perform similar analyses  but also factor in local laws and requirements 
we also compare our significant assumptions with our peers and discuss our key assumptions  prior to their incorporation into actuarial calculations  with the finance committee of our board of directors 
we evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations  cash flow requirements and other factors 

table of contents valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill  indefinite lived intangibles and other intangibles at fair value  as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
the initial recording of goodwill and intangibles requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
we test the value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as of december each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired 
the test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units  which correlate to our operating segments 
the test of indefinite lived intangibles involves significant judgment in estimating projections of future sales levels 
impairment losses for goodwill are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value 
impairment losses for intangibles are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units using the present value of estimated future cash flows  we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and market data used in discounting those cash flows 
inherent uncertainties exist in determining and applying such factors 
the discount rate used in the projection of fair value represents an internally estimated weighted average cost of capital of 
the net realizable value of other long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  is reviewed periodically  when indicators of potential impairments are present  based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets  utilizing methodologies similar to that for goodwill and indefinite lived assets 
additional considerations related to our long lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements  changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
accounting developments we have presented the information about accounting pronouncements not yet implemented in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
outlook for our future results of operations and other forward looking statements contained in this annual report  including this md a  involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular  the statements regarding our goals and strategies  new product introductions  plans to cultivate new businesses  future economic conditions  revenue  pricing  gross margin and costs  capital spending  depreciation and amortization  r d expenses  potential impairment of investments  the tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings 
our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount  type and valuation of the share based awards granted  as well as the amount of awards forfeited due to employee turnover 
in addition to the various important factors discussed above  a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
see the risks described in risk factors in part i  item a included in this annual report 
we experienced continued strengthening in our markets in  and we remain optimistic about our markets and our performance in  considering that the economic opportunities in many of our geographic and core industrial markets continue to be strong 
as a result of these factors  our revenues are expected to increase from  excluding currency fluctuations 
for additional discussion on our markets  see the business overview our markets section of this md a 
our bookings increased in as compared with  which should translate into increased revenue in however  as a booking represents a contract that can be modified or canceled  there is no guarantee that the increase in bookings will result in the same increase in revenues 
additionally  as lead times have extended  the timing for conversion of a booking into revenue is extending accordingly 
we expect our operating income to increase in as compared with  although there are a numbers of factors that could have a significant impact on our operating income in our operating income should 
table of contents continue to benefit from increased sales  which favorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs  as well as a number of operational improvement programs and increased utilization of our facilities 
in addition  continuation of our end user strategy  selective contract bidding and implemented price increases should also positively contribute to our operating income in however  a number of significant costs and certain other expenses will negatively impact our operating income in these include selected investments in technology infrastructure to consolidate our erp systems  professional fees incurred in the implementation of tax strategies  an increase in r d spending  and higher wage and benefit costs due to inflation and share based compensation 
additionally  the large proportion of original equipment business booked in by fpd may reduce gross profit margin as those products are shipped in and beyond 
on august   we amended our credit facilities to  among other things  reduce the applicable margin applied to borrowings under the revolving line of credit  as well as extend the maturity date of the revolving line of credit by two years  to august  all of our borrowings under our credit facilities carry a floating rate of interest 
as of december  we had million of derivative contracts to convert a portion of floating interest rates to fixed interest rates to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility 
as a result of reducing the volatility of the interest expense and reducing the applicable margin applied to our borrowings  we expect our interest expense in will be comparable to however  because a portion of our debt carries a floating rate of interest  the debt is subject to volatility in rates  which could negatively impact interest expense 
our results of operations may also be impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our business  capital expenditures  dividend payments  debt payments and pension plan contribution obligations and reduce our utilization of accounts receivable factoring arrangements 
we seek to continue to improve our working capital utilization  with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory  and requiring progress billings from customers on long lead time projects 
however  the amount of cash generated or consumed by working capital is dependent on our level of revenues  backlog  customer acceptance and other factors 
in  our capital expenditures are focused on strategic initiatives to pursue new markets  geographic expansion  capacity expansion  erp application upgrades  information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities and are expected to be between approximately million and million  before consideration of any acquisition activity 
while current pension regulations allow us latitude in the amount of contributions  we currently anticipate that our minimum contribution to our qualified us pension plan will be approximately million in we currently anticipate that our contributions to our non us pension plans will be approximately million in we have million in scheduled repayments in under our credit facilities 
we expect to comply with the covenants under our credit facilities in see the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a for further discussion of our debt covenants 
as we have discussed in this and prior publicly filed reports  we are currently subject to lawsuits  internal investigations and regulatory investigations in the us and in foreign countries  which could negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we believe we are currently dealing with these matters appropriately  and we are diligently striving to achieve the most favorable results 
in february  the board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of a share 
additional dividends of a share were approved in may  august and november of each quarter the board of directors will continue to evaluate paying a dividend as a method to return capital to our shareholders 
we expect that our corporate representatives will  from time to time  meet privately with investors  investment analysts  the media and others  and may reiterate the forward looking statements contained in this outlook for section and elsewhere in this annual report  including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this annual report 
at the same time  we will keep this annual report and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site www 
intc

the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered  unless we publish a notice stating otherwise 
statements in the business outlook and other forward looking statements in this annual report are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times

we perform credit evaluations of our counterparties under forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements and expect all counterparties to meet their obligations 
we have not experienced credit losses from our counterparties 
our earnings are impacted by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under our credit facilities  which bear interest based on floating rates 
at december   after the effect of interest rate swaps  we had million of variable rate debt obligations outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
a hypothetical change of basis points in the interest rate for these borrowings  assuming constant variable rate debt levels  would have changed interest expense in by approximately million 

table of contents we employ a foreign currency risk management strategy to minimize potential losses in earnings or cash flows from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 
these strategies also minimize potential gains from favorable exchange rate movements 
foreign currency exposures arise from transactions  including firm commitments and anticipated transactions  denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency and from translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars
