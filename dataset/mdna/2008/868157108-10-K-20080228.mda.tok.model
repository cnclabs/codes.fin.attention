executive summary we are a leading provider of oilfield services and equipment focused on serving the drilling related needs of oil and gas companies primarily through our rental tools segment  and the production related needs of oil and gas companies through our well intervention  rental tools and marine segments 
in recent years  we have expanded geographically into select domestic land and international market areas 
we also own and operate  through our subsidiary spn resources  llc  mature oil and gas properties in the gulf of mexico 
the financial performance of our various products and services are reported in four different segments well intervention  rental tools  marine and oil and gas 
in february  we entered into a purchase agreement to sell of our interest in spn resources for approximately million in cash  subject to certain conditions 
the transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of we will retain the preferential rights on all service work and have agreed to perform  on a fixed price basis  the decommissioning work associated with oil and gas properties owned and operated by spn resources at closing 
overview of our business segments the well intervention segment consists of specialized down hole services  which are both labor and equipment intensive 
we offer a wide variety of services used to maintain  enhance and extend oil and gas production from mature wells 
four services coiled tubing  electric line  hydraulic workover snubbing and well control each account for more than of this segment s revenue 
while our gross margin percentage tends to be fairly consistent  special projects such as well control can directly increase the gross margin 
the rental tools segment is capital intensive with high margins as a result of relatively low operating costs 
the largest fixed cost is depreciation as there is little labor associated with our rental tools businesses 
the financial performance primarily is a function of changes in volume rather than pricing 
three rental products and their ancillary equipment accommodations  drill pipe and stabilization tools each account for more than of this segment s revenue 
the marine segment is comprised of our rental liftboats 
operating costs of our liftboats are relatively fixed  and therefore  gross margin percentages vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year based on changes in dayrates and utilization levels 
as an indication of this segment s performance  gross margin for was as compared to in primarily due to decreases in dayrates and utilization across several of our liftboat classes 
through our subsidiary spn resources  llc  we acquire  manage and decommission mature properties on the outer continental shelf of the gulf of mexico 
as of december   we had interests in offshore blocks containing structures and approximately producing wells 
the main objective of this business segment is to provide additional opportunities for our products and services in the gulf of mexico  especially during cyclical and seasonal slower periods 
because of the fixed cost nature of our well intervention services  the incremental cost to work on mature properties is far less than it would be for traditional energy producers 
this segment provides work for our gulf of mexico based services  thereby increasing utilization of our own assets by deploying services on our own properties during periods of downtime 
the lease operating expenses for these types of properties are typically high because of the amount of well intervention service work required to enhance  maintain and extend production for mature properties 
the gross margin is also a function of the age of these oil and gas properties 

table of contents market drivers and conditions the oil and gas industry remains highly cyclical and seasonal 
activity levels in our well intervention  marine and rental tools segments are driven primarily by traditional energy industry activity indicators  which include current and expected commodity prices  drilling rig counts  well completions and workover activity  geological characteristics of producing wells which determine the number of services required per well  oil and gas production levels  and customers spending allocated for drilling and production work  which is reflected in our customers operating expenses or capital expenditures 
historical market indicators are listed below change change worldwide rig count us international commodity prices average crude oil west texas intermediate natural gas henry hub estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on baker hughes inc rig count information 
excludes canada rig count factors impacting our financial performance several factors contributed to our financial performance in first  we continued to execute our long term growth strategy of expanding geographically in an effort to reduce our dependency on a single geographic region  especially the gulf of mexico 
as evidence of our successful execution of the diversification strategy  our non gulf of mexico revenue was a record approximate million  or of our total revenue  as compared to approximately million  or of total revenue 
second  we experienced a significant increase in revenue from our domestic land markets  primarily due to acquisitions and capital expenditures 
third  average oil and natural gas prices increased over averages  which positively impacted customer spending as well as our financial performance in our oil and gas segment 
fourth  the average number of rigs drilling for oil and natural gas in domestic and international market areas increased over  which directly impacts demand for most of our rental tools and serves as a proxy for customer spending and activity levels on well intervention services 
fifth  we experienced a decrease in demand for liftboats and certain well intervention services in the gulf of mexico as construction  plug and abandonment  and other well intervention activity returned to more normal levels following a period of unprecedented demand in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita  which caused significant damage to oil and gas infrastructure in the gulf of mexico during the third quarter of although significant work remains to remove downed and damaged platforms  the immediate needs of the industry to restore production have been largely met 
geographically  our largest increase in revenue was from domestic land markets  which was approximately million  or of total revenue  as compared to approximately million  or of our total revenue in the two primary factors leading to this growth were acquisitions and capital expenditures 
starting with our acquisition of warrior energy services  inc in december  we made four acquisitions through december  of businesses with significant exposure to certain domestic land market areas 
warrior energy services  which was the largest of these acquisitions  continued an aggressive growth strategy in which it spent approximately million to purchase coiled tubing spreads and electric line spreads 
these acquisitions and subsequent capital expenditures contributed approximately million in domestic land revenue in international revenue was approximately million  or of total revenue  as compared to approximately million  or of total revenue in the primary reasons for the increase were an approximate million increase in international revenue from our rental tools segment as a result of an increase in the international drilling rig count and our capital expenditures 
in addition  international revenue from our well intervention segment 
table of contents increased from approximately million to approximately million in due primarily to our derrick barge charter and construction contracts and additional revenue from two of our core businesses well control and hydraulic workover snubbing 
gulf of mexico revenue was approximately million or of total revenue  as compared to million  or of total revenue in gulf of mexico revenue from our well intervention  rental tools and oil and gas segments increased approximately million  which offset an approximate decrease of million from the marine segment 
well intervention revenue from the gulf of mexico increased approximately million  or to approximately million  primarily related to increases in hydraulic workover  snubbing and well control activity 
rental tools revenue from the gulf of mexico increased approximately million  or to approximately million  as a result of increases in deepwater drilling activity  which lead to increases in drill pipe rentals 
in addition  rentals of stabilizers  drill collars and connecting iron also increased 
oil and gas revenue increased approximately million  or due to a increase in barrels of oil and gas equivalent boe produced as well as a increase in average realized prices 
in  shut in production resulting from damage caused by the hurricane season did not fully return until the second quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a description of the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to long lived assets and goodwill  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  self insurance and oil and gas properties 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we define a critical accounting policy or estimate as one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimates but are not deemed critical as defined in this paragraph 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets  including oil and gas properties  used in operations when the estimated cash flows to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based upon  among other things  historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market rates  utilization levels  operating performance  and with respect to our oil and gas properties  future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas and other factors 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
if the sum of the cash flows is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the net carrying value of assets not fully recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimate of fair value represents our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions adversely change in the future  we may be required to record material impairment charges for these 
table of contents assets not previously recorded 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas no 
requires that goodwill as well as other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
our annual testing of goodwill is based on our fair value and carrying value at december we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units which are consistent with our reportable segments using various cash flow and earnings projections 
we then compare these fair value estimates to the carrying value of our reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment loss is recognized 
our estimates of the fair value of these reporting units represent our best estimates based on industry trends and reference to market transactions 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition or the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities  could affect these estimates 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  on a case by case basis  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding customer s creditworthiness known to us 
in addition  we record a reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against which we do not have specific reserves 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
revenue recognition 
our products and services are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with customers that include fixed or determinable prices 
we recognize revenue when services or equipment are provided and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we contract for marine  well intervention and environmental projects either on a day rate or turnkey basis  with a majority of our projects conducted on a day rate basis 
our rental tools are rented on a day rate basis  and revenue from the sale of equipment is recognized when the equipment is shipped 
we are using the percentage of completion method for recognizing our revenues and related costs on our contract to construct a derrick barge for a third party 
we are estimating the percentage complete utilizing engineering estimates and construction progress 
we recognize oil and gas revenue from our interests in producing wells as the commodities are delivered  and the revenue is recorded net of royalties and hedge payments due or inclusive of hedge payments receivable 
self insurance 
we self insure  through deductibles and retentions  up to certain levels for losses related to workers compensation  third party liability insurances  property damage  and group medical 
with the growth of the company  we have elected to retain more risk by increasing our self insurance 
we accrue for these liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through reserves 
we also have actuarial reviews our estimates for losses related to workers compensation and group medical on an annual basis 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  our financial results could be impacted if litigation trends  claims settlement patterns and future inflation rates are different from our estimates 
although we believe adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  and we believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage  we cannot assure that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
oil and gas properties 
our subsidiary  spn resources  llc  acquires mature oil and gas properties and assumes the related well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our investment in oil and natural gas properties 
under the successful efforts method  the costs of successful exploratory wells and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized 
costs incurred to drill and 
table of contents equip developmental wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized 
other costs such as geological and geophysical costs and the drilling costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed 
spn resources property purchases are recorded at the value exchanged at closing  combined with an estimate of its proportionate share of the decommissioning liability assumed in the purchase 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field and allocated to leasehold costs and well costs 
leasehold costs are depleted on a units of production basis based on the estimated remaining equivalent proved oil and gas reserves of each field 
well costs are depleted on a units of production basis based on the estimated remaining equivalent proved developed oil and gas reserves of each field 
we estimate the third party market price to plug and abandon wells  abandon the pipelines  decommission and remove the platforms and clear the sites  and use that estimate to record our proportionate share of the decommissioning liability 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis and engineering studies 
whenever practical  we will utilize the services of our subsidiaries to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by our subsidiaries  all recorded intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
the liability is first reduced by all cash expenses incurred to abandon and decommission the property 
if the liability exceeds or is less than our incurred costs  the difference is reported as income or loss in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities recorded  which in turn would increase the carrying values of the related properties 
oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value on a field by field basis whenever indicators become evident 
we use our current estimate of future revenues and operating expenses to test the capitalized costs for impairment 
in the event net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded based on the present value of expected future net cash flows over the economic lives of the reserves 
proved reserve estimates 
our reserve information is prepared by independent reserve engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission 
there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond our control such as commodity pricing 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s guidelines  we use prices and costs determined on the date of the actual estimate and a discount rate to determine the present value of future net cash flow 
actual prices and costs may vary significantly  and the discount rate may or may not be appropriate based on outside economic conditions 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenues were  million  resulting in net income of million or diluted earnings per share 
our net income includes a pre tax gain of million from the sale of a non core rental tool business 
for the year ended december   revenues were  million  and net income was million or diluted earnings per share 
net income for the year ended december  includes a pre tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
revenue and gross margin were higher in the well intervention and rental tools segments as a result of increased production related projects and drilling activity worldwide  recent acquisitions and continued expansion of our rental tool business 
both revenue and gross margin decreased in our marine segment due to lower utilization 
both revenue and gross margin in our oil and gas segment were significantly higher due to higher commodity prices and higher production as a portion of production was impacted by shut in production due to hurricanes katrina and rita

well intervention segment revenue for our well intervention segment was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for this segment s gross margin percentage increased to in from in we experienced higher revenue for most of our production related services 
approximately of our increase in revenue is attributable to acquisition and disposition activities occurring late in and throughout an additional of the increase in revenue is from a full year of activity related to the charter of a derrick barge as well as a contract to construct a derrick barge to be sold to a third party for approximately million 
the balance of the increase in revenue is attributable to increased well control and hydraulic workover services as production related activity improved 
rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment for was million  a increase over the gross margin percentage remained relatively constant at in as compared to in in  we sold the assets of a non core rental business 
we experienced significant increases in revenue from our stabilizers  on site accommodations  drill pipe and accessories  and drill collars

well intervention segment revenue for our well intervention segment was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for this segment s gross margin percentage increased to in from in we experienced higher revenue for most of our production related services as activity levels increased significantly due to increased demand for production related services and hurricane related repair work in the gulf of mexico 
as a measure of increased activity  our plug and abandonment crew count increased by approximately over and our offshore mechanical wireline job count increased by approximately 
we also increased our 
table of contents revenues in domestic onshore markets and acquired warrior energy services corporation in december to further this expansion and strengthen this segment 
our mechanical wireline job count increased approximately in domestic land market areas 
rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment for was million  a increase over the gross margin percentage increased to in from in we experienced significant increases in revenue from our stabilizers  on site accommodations  drill pipe and accessories  specialty tubulars and drill collars 
the increases are primarily the result of significant increases in activity in the gulf of mexico  domestic land markets  as well as our international expansion efforts 
our rental revenue in the gulf of mexico increased to approximately million 
similarly  rental revenue from domestic land markets also increased significantly   to approximately million 
our international revenue for the rental tools segment has increased to approximately million for over marine segment our marine segment revenue for the year ended december  increased over to million 
the gross margin percentage for increased to from in the year ended december  was characterized by a significant increase in liftboat pricing and utilization due to increased demand resulting from increases in gulf of mexico production related activity and ongoing construction and repair work as a result of the damage in the gulf of mexico from hurricanes katrina and rita

the balance of the increase results from the depreciation associated with our and capital expenditures  primarily in the rental tools segment 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in this increase was primarily attributable to increased expense related to our continued growth through expanding our geographic area of operations and acquisitions as well as increased incentive compensation expense due to our strong operating results 
general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenue for from in liquidity and capital resources in the year ended december   we generated net cash from operating activities of million as compared to million in our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings 
table of contents under our revolving credit facility 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  we made approximately million of capital expenditures during the year ended december   of which approximately million was used to expand and maintain our rental tool equipment inventory 
we also made million of capital expenditures in our oil and gas segment and million of capital expenditures to expand and maintain the asset base of our well intervention and marine segments 
in addition  we made million of capital expenditures on construction and improvements to our facilities 
in january  we acquired duffy mcgovern accommodation services limited  a provider of offshore accommodation rentals operating in most deep water oil and gas territories with major operations in europe  africa  the americas and south east asia  for approximately million in cash consideration 
in april  we also acquired advanced oilwell services  inc  a provider of cementing and pressure pumping services primarily operating in the east texas region  for approximately million in cash consideration 
in august  we sold the assets of a non core rental tool business for approximately million in cash and million in a note receivable 
we have a million bank revolving credit facility 
any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due on june  at february   no amounts were outstanding under the bank credit facility  but we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding  which reduces our borrowing capacity under this credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a libor rate plus margins that depend on our leverage ratio 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including the pledge of the stock of our principal subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various financial covenants 
it also limits our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions  make acquisitions  create liens  incur additional indebtedness or assume additional decommissioning liabilities 
we have million outstanding at december  in u

government guaranteed long term financing under title xi of the merchant marine act of  which is administered by the maritime administration marad  for two foot class liftboats 
this debt bears an interest rate of per annum and is payable in equal semi annual installments of  on every june rd and december rd through june  our obligations are secured by mortgages on the two liftboats 
this marad financing also requires that we comply with certain covenants and restrictions  including the maintenance of minimum net worth and debt to equity requirements

under certain circumstances  holders may exchange the notes for shares of our common stock 
the initial exchange rate is shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
this is equal to an initial exchange price of per share 
the exchange price represents a premium over the closing share price at the date of issuance 
the notes may be exchanged under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter and only during such fiscal quarter commencing after march   if the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to of the applicable exchange price of the notes for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  
table of contents prior to december   during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price of  principal amount of notes for each trading day in the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the exchange rate on such trading day  if the notes have been called for redemption  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  or at any time beginning on september   and ending at the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding the maturity date 
in connection with the exchangeable note transaction  we simultaneously entered into agreements with affiliates of the initial purchasers to purchase call options and sell warrants on our common stock 
we may exercise the call options we purchased at any time to acquire approximately million shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share 
the owners of the warrants may exercise the warrants to purchase from us approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share  subject to certain anti dilution and other customary adjustments 
the warrants may be settled in cash  in shares or in a combination of cash and shares  at our option 
these transactions may potentially reduce the dilution of our common stock from the exchange of the notes by increasing the effective exchange price to per share 
we paid million exclusive of a million tax benefit to acquire the call options and received million as a result of the sale of the warrants 
in october  we repurchased and retired  shares of our outstanding common stock at an average price of per share  or approximately million in the aggregate  in connection with our million share repurchase program that will expire on december  the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december  amounts in thousands for our long term debt including estimated interest payments  decommissioning liabilities  operating leases and contractual obligations 
the decommissioning liability amounts do not give any effect to our contractual right to receive amounts from third parties  which is approximately million  when decommissioning operations are performed 
the vessel construction obligation amounts do not give any effect to our contractual right to receive payments from a third party customer  which is approximately million 
we do not have any other material obligations or commitments 
description thereafter long term debt  including estimated interest payments decommissioning liabilities operating leases vessel construction total we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than our potential additional consideration that may be payable as a result of the future operating performances of our acquisitions 
at december   the maximum additional consideration payable for our prior acquisitions was approximately million 
these amounts are not classified as liabilities under current generally accepted accounting principles and are not reflected in our financial statements until the amounts are fixed and determinable 
when amounts are determined  they are capitalized as part of the purchase price of the related acquisition 
we do not have any other financing arrangements that are not required under generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected in our financial statements 
we currently believe that we will make approximately million of capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions and targeted asset purchases  during to expand our rental tool asset base  add new coiled tubing and electric line units  complete construction on our derrick barge and perform workovers on spn resources oil and gas properties 
we believe that our current working capital  cash generated from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds for our identified capital projects 

table of contents we intend to continue implementing our growth strategy of increasing our scope of services through both internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we expect to continue to make the capital expenditures required to implement our growth strategy in amounts consistent with the amount of cash generated from operating activities  the availability of additional financing and our credit facility 
depending on the size of any future acquisitions  we may require additional equity or debt financing in excess of our current working capital and amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
hedging activities we entered into hedging transactions in that expired on august  to secure a commodity price for a portion of our oil production and to reduce our exposure to oil price fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 
we used financially settled crude oil swaps and zero cost collars that provided floor and ceiling prices with varying upside price participation 
our swaps and zero cost collars were designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges 
we have not hedged any of our natural gas production 
we recognized the fair value of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges  to the extent the hedge was effective  were recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item was settled and recorded in oil and gas revenues 
for the year ended december   hedging settlement payments reduced oil and gas revenues by approximately million  and no gains or losses were recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued its statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 fair value measurements 
fas no 
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
fas no 
indicates  among other things  a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or  in the absence of a principal market  the most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
fas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact that fas no 
will have on our results of operations and financial position 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued its statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
a discussion of our market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
foreign currency exchange rates because we operate in a number of countries throughout the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for our international operations  other than our operations in the united kingdom and the netherlands  is the us dollar  but a portion of the revenues from our foreign operations is paid in foreign currencies 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partly mitigated because local expenses of such foreign operations are also generally denominated in the same currency 
we continually monitor the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in the us dollar 
any gains or losses associated with such fluctuations have not been material 
we do not hold any foreign currency exchange forward contracts and or currency options 
we have not made use of derivative financial instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes or use derivatives with complex features 
assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and the netherlands are translated at current exchange rates  while income and expense are translated at average rates for the period 
translation gains and losses are reported as the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
interest rates at december   none of our outstanding long term debt had variable interest rates  and we had no interest rate risks at that time 
equity price risk in december  we issued million of senior exchangeable notes due in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers 
the notes are  subject to the occurrence of specified conditions  exchangeable for our common stock initially at an exchange price of per share  which would result in an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock being issued upon exchange 
we may redeem for cash all or any part of the notes on or after december  for of the principal amount redeemed 
the holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of the notes on december   december  and december  for of the principal amount of notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
the notes do not contain any restrictive financial covenants 
each  of principal amount of the notes is initially exchangeable into shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
holders of the notes may exchange their notes prior to maturity only if the price of our common stock reaches of the applicable exchange rate during certain periods of time specified in the notes  specified corporate transactions occur  the notes have been called for redemption  or the trading price of the notes falls below a certain threshold 
in addition  in the event of a fundamental change in our corporate ownership or structure  the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of the notes for of the principal amount 

table of contents concurrently with the issuance of the notes  we entered into agreements with affiliates of the initial purchasers to purchase call options and sell warrants of our common stock 
we may exercise the call options at any time to acquire approximately million shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share 
the owners of the warrants may exercise their warrants to purchase from us approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share  subject to certain anti dilution and other customary adjustments 
the warrants may be settled in cash  in shares or in a combination of cash and shares  at our option 
we paid million exclusive of a million tax benefit to acquire the call options and received million as a result of the sale of the warrants 
for additional discussion of the notes  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in part ii  item commodity price risk our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth partially depends upon the market prices of oil and natural gas 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that can economically be produced 
we have used derivative commodity instruments to manage commodity price risks associated with future oil production 
we have not hedged any of our natural gas production 
our hedging contracts for a portion of our oil production expired on august   and there are no outstanding contracts as of december  or as of the date of this form k
