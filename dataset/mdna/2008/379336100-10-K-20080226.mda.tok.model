table of contents part i item business we provide worldwide construction and subsea services including pipeline construction  platform installation and removal  project management  construction support  diving services  diverless intervention  and marine support services to the offshore oil and gas industry primarily in selected international areas and the united states gulf of mexico 
unless the context indicates otherwise  all references to we  us  our  or the company refer to global industries  ltd 
and its consolidated subsidiaries 
segments of business our worldwide business is divided into six reportable segments gulf of mexico offshore construction division  gulf of mexico subsea  latin america  west africa  middle east including the mediterranean  and asia pacific india 
for additional segment information  please refer to the narrative and tabular descriptions of our segments and operating results under management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition in item of part ii of this annual report and under note industry  segment and geographic information in item of part ii of this annual report 
description of operations we began as a provider of diving services to the offshore oil and gas industry over thirty years ago and have used selective acquisitions  new construction  and upgrades to expand our operations and assets 
on december   our fleet included fourteen major construction vessels mcvs  three cargo launch barges  and ten dive support vessels dsvs 
our major construction vessels  which include eleven barges  two ships  and one small waterplane area twin hull swath vessel  have various combinations of pipelay  pipebury  derrick  dive support and deepwater lowering capabilities 
in  we announced a fleet modernization plan to upgrade our fleet of vessels and to expand our fleet with the construction of a multi service vessel msv charter for delivery in mid and a million pipelay derrick barge currently being constructed with expected completion in we are a leading offshore construction company offering a comprehensive and integrated range of marine construction and support services in the us gulf of mexico  latin america  west africa  the middle east including the mediterranean  and asia pacific india regions 
these services include pipeline construction  platform installation and removal  project management  construction support  diving services  diverless intervention  and marine support services 
we are equipped to provide services from shallow water to water depths of up to  feet 
as exploration companies have made considerable commitments and expenditures for production in water depths over  feet  we have invested in vessels  equipment  technology  and skills to increase our abilities to provide services in this growing deepwater market 
our business consists of two principal activities offshore construction services  which include pipeline construction and platform installation and removal services  and subsea services  which include diving and diverless intervention  and marine support services 
for financial information regarding our operating segments and the geographic areas in which we operate  please read note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report 
offshore construction services our offshore construction services include pipelay  derrick  project management  and related services 
we are capable of installing steel pipe by either the conventional or the reel method of pipelaying using either manual or automatic welding processes 
with the conventional method  foot to foot segments of up to inch diameter pipe are welded together  x ray tested and corrosion coated on the deck of the pipelay 
table of contents vessel 
each segment of pipe is connected to the prior segment of pipe and then submerged in the water as the vessel is moved forward by its anchor winches or  in some instances  onboard thrusters 
this process is repeated until the desired length of pipe has been laid 
in good weather conditions and shallow water  our vessels can install approximately feet per hour of small diameter pipe using the conventional pipelay method 
as pipe diameter increases  water depth increases  or weather conditions become less favorable  our rate of pipeline installation declines 
the conventional method of pipeline construction is still the preferred method for laying pipelines in certain situations  especially in shallow water where pipeline burying is required and can be performed simultaneously with the laying of pipe 
we have the ability to install pipelines using the conventional method in the us gulf of mexico  latin america  west africa  the middle east  and asia pacific india 
several of our vessels employ dynamic positioning technology  which uses onboard thrusters in conjunction with global positioning system technology to enable a vessel to remain on station or move with precision without the use of anchors 
we are also capable of installing pipelines using the reel method of pipeline construction 
under the reel method  welding and testing are performed onshore  and then the pipe is spooled in one continuous length onto a large reel on a specially designed major construction vessel 
once the vessel is in the proper position offshore  the pipe is unreeled onto the ocean floor as the vessel moves forward 
this method of pipeline construction is generally used for pipelines with diameters of inches or less and is especially well suited for deep water where pipeline burying is not required and for seasons with inclement weather since offshore installation can be performed quickly between periods of rough weather 
the pipeline construction services which we perform by the reel method are primarily performed in the us gulf of mexico 
in the gulf of mexico  the united states department of interior minerals management service mms requires the burial of all offshore oil and gas pipelines greater than inches in diameter and located in water depths of feet or less 
we believe we have the equipment and expertise necessary to assist our customers with compliance with these mms regulations 
regulations also require that these pipelines be periodically inspected  repaired  and if necessary  reburied 
inspection requires extensive diving or remotely operated vehicle rov services  and rebury requires either hand jetting by divers or the use of one of our major construction vessels and a jet sled a large machine  typically towed behind a major construction vessel  which uses powerful streams of water to bury a pipeline as the vessel moves forward 
all of our major construction vessels are equipped with cranes designed to lift and place equipment into position for installation 
nine of these vessels are capable of lifts of tons or more  making them suitable for very heavy lifts such as offshore platform installations 
in addition  the vessels can be used to disassemble and remove platforms and prepare them for salvage or refurbishment 
current mms regulations require platforms to be removed within twelve months after production ceases and that the site be restored to meet stringent standards 
according to the mms  in january there were approximately  platforms on active leases in us waters of the gulf of mexico 
we expect demand for gulf of mexico abandonment services to increase as more platforms are removed due to these mms regulations 
subsea services demand for subsea services covers the full life cycle of an offshore oil and gas property  including supporting exploration  supporting platform and pipeline installation  performing periodic inspections of pipelines and platforms  performing repairs and maintenance to pipelines and platforms  installing surf subsea equipment  umbilical riser and flowline  providing rov services  and ultimately  performing salvage and site clearance services 
to support our subsea operations  we operate a fleet of five dsvs domestically and five dsvs internationally 
two of these dynamic positioning vessels have deepwater lowering capability to  meters 
we have recorded the deepest working dive in the gulf of mexico at  feet 
in early  we will also take delivery of two state of the art work class rovs 

table of contents for the gulf of mexico  the mms requires that all offshore structures have extensive and detailed inspections for corrosion  metal thickness  and structural damage every five years 
as the age of the offshore infrastructure increases  we anticipate that demand for inspections  repairs  and wet welding technology will increase over the next three to five years 
for subsea projects involving long duration and deepwater dives to  feet  we use saturation diving systems that maintain an environment for the divers at the subsea water pressure at which they are working until the job is completed 
saturation diving allows divers to make repeated dives without decompressing  thereby reducing the time necessary to complete the job and reducing the diver s exposure to the risks associated with frequent decompression 
at december   we owned fifteen saturation diving systems 
two of our largest saturation diving systems are capable of maintaining an environment simulating subsea water pressures to  feet 
our pipelay and derrick operations create captive demand for our saturation diving services  for which divers are highly compensated 
this ability to offer our divers saturation diving work helps us to attract and retain qualified and experienced divers 
we have been at the forefront in the development of many underwater welding techniques 
underwater welds are made by two methods dry hyperbaric welding and wet welding 
in dry hyperbaric welding  a customized  watertight enclosure is engineered and fabricated to fit the specific requirements of the structural joint or pipeline requiring repairs 
the enclosure is lowered into the water  attached to the structure  and then the water is evacuated  allowing divers to enter the chamber and perform dry welding repairs 
wet welding is accomplished while divers are in the water  using specialized welding rods 
wet welding is less costly because it eliminates the need to construct an expensive  customized  single use enclosure 
we believe that we have been a leader in improving wet welding techniques and that we have satisfied the technical specifications for customers wet welded repairs in water depths to feet 
our research and development center includes a hyperbaric facility capable of simulating wet or dry welding environments for water depths of up to  feet so that welds can be performed and tested to assure compliance with the customer s technical specifications 
we also operate other offshore support vessels osvs internationally to support our offshore construction services and offer time charters to the offshore service industry 
business strategy in  we will continue to grow focus on our four strategic initiatives including geographical diversification  broadening our business segments with emphasis on deepwater surf  integrated projects  irm and decommissioning plug and abandonment p a  upgrading our fleet of vessels  and making major investments in both our people and technology 
raw materials our offshore construction activities require raw materials  such as carbon and alloy steels in various forms  welding gases  paint  fuels and lubricants  which are available from many sources 
we do not depend on a single supplier or source for any of these materials 
although shortages of some of these materials and fuels have existed from time to time  no material shortage currently exists 
however  steel prices are volatile  and shortages may occur from time to time 
customers and contracts our customers are primarily oil and gas producers and pipeline companies 
during the year ended december   we provided offshore marine construction services to approximately eighty customers 
our largest single customer in any one of the last three years  petroleos mexicanos pemex  accounted for   and of consolidated revenues in respective years   and the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our latin america segment and the company 

table of contents the level of construction services required by any particular customer depends on the size of that customer s capital expenditure budget devoted to construction projects in a particular year 
consequently  customers that account for a significant portion of revenues in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of revenues in subsequent fiscal years 
our traditional contracts are typically of short duration  being completed in one to five months 
engineering  procurement  installation and commissioning contracts epic  turnkey contracts  and certain international contracts may be performed over time periods exceeding one year 
contracts for work in the gulf of mexico are typically awarded on a competitive bid basis with customers usually requesting bids on projects one to three months prior to commencement 
however  for projects in water depths greater than  feet  turnkey projects  and projects in international areas  the elapsed time from bid request to commencement of work may exceed one year 
our marketing staff contacts offshore operators known to have projects scheduled to ensure that we have an opportunity to bid for the projects 
most contracts are awarded on a fixed price basis  but we also perform work on a cost plus or day rate basis  or on a combination of such bases 
we attempt to qualify our contracts so we can recover the costs of certain unexpected difficulties and the costs of weather related delays 
competition in each region of the world in which we operate  the offshore marine construction industry is highly competitive 
price competition and contract terms are the primary factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job 
however  the ability to deploy modern equipment and techniques  to attract and retain skilled personnel  and to demonstrate a good safety record have also been important competitive factors 
major international competitors include acergy sa  allseas marine contractors  sa  heerema sa  j 
ray mcdermott  saipem sa  subsea  and technip  sa some of these international competitors also bid and compete for projects in the us gulf of mexico 
in addition  internationally  there are numerous other regionalized competitors with whom we compete directly 
domestic competition for deepwater projects in the us gulf of mexico includes allseas marine contractors  sa  helix energy solutions group  inc  heerema sa  and j 
ray mcdermott sa our competitors for shallow and intermediate water domestic projects include cal dive international and many smaller companies including bisso marine company  chet morrison contractors  inc  and offshore specialties fabricators  inc 
many shallow and intermediate water companies compete primarily based on price 
backlog our backlog of construction contracts includes signed contracts  letters of intent that are not materially qualified or contingent  and change orders to the extent of the lower of cost or probable recovery 
as of december   our backlog amounted to approximately million million for international operations and million for the us gulf of mexico  compared to our backlog at december  of million million for international operations and million for the us gulf of mexico 
our backlog as of december  is scheduled to be performed during due to the prevalence of day rate and short term contractual arrangements in the us gulf of mexico  our backlog and bidding activity statistics do not provide a good indication of the level of demand for our services in this region 
we do not consider the backlog amounts in any region to be a reliable indicator of future earnings 

table of contents factors affecting demand our level of offshore construction activity primarily depends upon the capital expenditures of oil and gas companies and foreign governments for construction services associated with offshore oil and gas exploration  development  and production projects 
numerous factors influence these expenditures  including the following oil and gas prices  along with expectations about future prices  the cost of exploring for  producing  and delivering oil and gas  the terms and conditions of offshore leases  the discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas  the ability of businesses in the oil and gas industry to raise capital  and local and international political and economic conditions 
please read item a  risk factors  for further information on factors affecting demand 
patents we own or are the licensee of a number of patents in the united states and in other countries related to pipelaying 
for example  we own united states patent number  this patent involves a novel barge system for laying deep water subsea pipelines either by means of reeled pipe or conventional pipelaying procedures and covers several features incorporated into the hercules 
we are currently pursuing patent protection for this invention in a number of foreign countries 
we have also obtained technology by acquiring the assets of other companies  through license agreements with other companies  and through certain aspects of the chickasaw s reel technology 
while our continuing technical operations are not materially dependent on any one or more of our licenses or patent rights  these rights do enhance our competitive position by allowing us to offer a more efficient package of services to our customers 
employees our work force varies based on our workload at any particular time 
during  the number of our employees  not including subcontractors  ranged from  to  as of december   we had  employees 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory 
seasonality each of the geographical areas in which we operate has seasonal patterns that affect our operating patterns 
our operating patterns are primarily related to the offshore weather conditions where our projects are performed 
in general  our offshore operations are disrupted when seasonal winds or currents  which may vary by country or location within our operating segments  make the seas too rough for our vessels to work safely and efficiently 
our operating patterns are also affected by the timing of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies 
some of these companies are national oil and gas companies which may be affected by local political factors and cycles 
government regulation and environmental matters many aspects of the offshore marine construction industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation 
in the united states  we are subject to the jurisdiction of the united states coast guard  the national transportation safety board and the customs service  as well as private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
the coast guard and the national transportation safety board set safety standards and are authorized to investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards  and the customs service is authorized to inspect vessels at will 

table of contents we are required by various governmental and quasi governmental agencies to obtain certain permits  licenses  and certificates with respect to our operations 
the kind of permits  licenses  and certificates required in our operations depends upon a number of factors 
we believe that we have obtained or can obtain all permits  licenses  and certificates necessary to conduct our business 
we depend on the demand for our services from the oil and gas industry and  therefore  laws and regulations  as well as changing taxes and policies relating to the oil and gas industry affect our business 
in particular  the exploration and development of oil and gas properties located on the outer continental shelf of the united states is regulated primarily by the mms 
our operations also are affected by numerous federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment including  in the united states  the outer continental shelf lands act  the federal water pollution control act of  and the oil pollution act of the technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex and stringent  and compliance may become increasingly difficult and expensive 
however  we believe that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial statements 
certain environmental laws provide for strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances and some provide liability for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety 
sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits  corrective action orders  administrative or civil penalties  and criminal prosecution 
our compliance with these laws and regulations has entailed certain changes in our operating procedures and approximately million in expenditures during it is possible that changes in the environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder or claims for damages to persons  property  natural resources  or the environment could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 
our insurance policies provide liability coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences of pollution and or clean up and containment of the foregoing in amounts that we believe are comparable to policy limits carried in the marine construction industry 
certain ancillary activities related to the offshore construction industry  especially the transportation of personnel and equipment between port and the field of work offshore  constitute coastwise trade within the meaning of federal maritime regulations 
we are also subject to regulation by the united states maritime administration marad  coast guard  and customs services 
under these regulations  only vessels owned by united states citizens that are built and registered under the laws of the united states may engage in coastwise trade 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation are intended to aid in compliance with the foregoing requirements regarding ownership by persons other than united states citizens 
in  we complied with the international ship and port facility security code isps as mandated by the homeland security act of under the isps  we performed worldwide security assessments  plans  risk analyses  and other requirements on our vessels and port facilities and completed the process of installing automated identification systems on our vessels

table of contents item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves certain risks 
if any of these risks were to occur  our business  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose part or all of your investment 
among the key risk factors that may have a direct impact on our business  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition are the following 
our business is substantially dependent on the level of capital expenditures in the oil and gas industry  and lower capital expenditures will adversely affect our results of operations 
the demand for our services depends on the condition of the oil and gas industry and  in particular  on the capital expenditures of companies engaged in the offshore exploration  development  and production of oil and natural gas 
capital expenditures by these companies are primarily influenced by four factors the oil and gas industry s ability to economically justify placing discoveries of oil and gas reserves in production  the oil and gas industry s need to maintain  repair and replace existing pipelines and structures to extend the life of production  the oil and gas industry s need to clear structures from the lease once the oil and gas reserves have been depleted  and weather events  such as major tropical storms 
historically  prices of oil and natural gas and offshore exploration  development and production have fluctuated substantially 
a sustained period of substantially reduced capital expenditures by oil and gas companies will result in decreased demand for our services  low margins  and possibly net losses 
our international operations expose us to additional risks inherent in doing business abroad 
a majority of our revenue is derived from operations outside the united states 
the scope and extent of our operations outside of the us gulf of mexico means we are exposed to the risks inherent in doing business abroad 
these risks include the following currency exchange rate fluctuations  devaluations  and restrictions on currency repatriation  unfavorable taxes  tax increases  and retroactive tax claims  the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances  insurrection  war  or acts of terrorism that may disrupt or limit markets  expropriation or seizure of our property  nullification  modification  or renegotiation of existing contracts  regional economic downturns  import export quotas and other forms of public and governmental regulation  and inability to obtain or retain licenses required for operations 
we cannot predict the nature of foreign governmental regulations applicable to our operations that may be enacted in the future 
in many cases  our direct or indirect customer will be a foreign government  which can increase our exposure to these risks 
us government imposed export restrictions or trade sanctions under the export administration act of  the trading with the enemy act of or similar legislation or regulation also may impede our ability to expand our operations and bid for and accept work in specific countries that we might otherwise have the equipment and technical ability to compete 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operation  and cash flows 

table of contents we are exposed to the substantial hazards and risks inherent in marine construction  and our insurance coverage is limited 
our business involves a high degree of operational risks 
hazards and risks that are inherent in marine operations include capsizing  grounding  colliding  and sustaining damage from severe weather conditions 
in addition  our construction work can disrupt existing pipeline  platforms and other offshore structures 
any of these incidents could cause damage to or destruction of vessels  property or equipment  personal injury or loss of life  suspension of production operations  or environmental damage 
the failure of offshore pipelines or structural components during or after our installation could also result in similar injuries or damages 
any of these events could result in interruption of our business or significant liability 
we cannot always obtain insurance for our operating risks  and it is not practical to insure against all risks in all geographic areas 
builders risk insurance is becoming increasingly expensive and coverage limits have been decreasing 
uninsured liabilities resulting from our operations may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we depend on significant customers 
some of our segments derive a significant amount of their revenues from a small number of customers 
for example  sales to pemex represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and substantially all of our latin american revenue in the inability of these segments to continue to perform services for a number of their large existing customers and particularly the inability of our latin america segment to continue to perform services for pemex  if not offset by contracts with new or other existing customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
if we are unable to attract and retain skilled workers our business will be adversely affected 
our operations depend substantially upon our ability to retain and attract project managers  project engineers  and skilled construction workers such as divers  welders  pipefitters  and equipment operators 
our ability to expand our operations is impacted by our ability to increase our labor force 
the demand for skilled workers in our industry is currently high  and the supply is limited 
as a result of the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry as well as the physically demanding nature of the work  skilled workers may choose to pursue employment in other fields 
a significant increase in the wages paid or benefits offered by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force  increases in our employee costs  or both 
if either of these events occur  our operations and results could be materially adversely affected 
we may be unable to obtain critical project materials or services on a timely basis 
our operations depend on our ability to procure on a timely basis project materials  such as pipe  or project services  such as tugboats for barges  to complete projects in an efficient manner 
our inability to timely procure these resources could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not complete fixed price or unit rate contracts within our original estimates of costs  which will adversely affect our results 
because of the nature of the offshore construction industry  most of our projects are performed on a fixed price or unit rate basis 
the profits we realize on one of our contracts will often vary from the estimated amounts because of changes in offshore job conditions  in labor and equipment productivity  and in third party costs 
in addition  we sometimes bear the risk of delays caused by bad weather conditions 
we may continue to suffer lower profits or even losses on some projects because of cost overruns resulting from these or other causes 

table of contents our industry is highly competitive 
contracts for our services are generally awarded on a competitive bid basis  and price is a primary factor in determining who is awarded the project 
customers also consider availability and capability of equipment  reputation  experience  and the safety record of the contender in awarding jobs 
during industry down cycles in particular  we may have to accept lower rates for our services and vessels or increased contractual liabilities which could result in lower profits or even losses 
as we have increased our operations in deeper waters and internationally  we have encountered additional competitors  many of whom have greater experience than we do in these markets and greater resources 
additionally  our competitiveness in international markets may be adversely affected by regulations requiring  among other things  the awarding of contracts to local contractors  the employment of local citizens and or the purchase of supplies from local vendors that favor or require local ownership 
we operate in countries where corrupt behavior exists that could impair our ability to do business in the future or result in significant fines or penalties 
we and our affiliates operate in countries where governmental corruption has been known to exist 
while we and our subsidiaries are committed to conducting business in a legal and ethical manner  there is a risk of violating either the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or laws or legislation promulgated pursuant to the oecd convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions or other applicable anti corruption regulations that generally prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business 
some of the internal control deficiencies identified by our management relate to our operations in west africa and other foreign jurisdictions 
these deficiencies make it more likely that a violation could have occurred 
violation of these laws could result in monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and  therefore  our ability to do business 
for information concerning a current investigation related to fcpa matters in west africa  see item legal proceedings 
our internal controls may not be sufficient to achieve all stated goals and objectives  existing deficiencies may not be adequately remediated 
our internal controls and procedures were developed through a process in which our management applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures  which  by their nature  can provide only reasonable assurance regarding the control objectives 
the design of any system of internal controls and procedures is based in part upon various assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  regardless of how remote 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires that management document and test the internal controls over financial reporting and to assert annually in our annual report on form k whether the internal controls over financial reporting at year end are effective 
we have not identified any material weaknesses in our internal controls as defined by the public company accounting oversight board 
during the course of documenting and testing our internal controls to ensure compliance with section  we identified certain internal control issues and significant deficiencies which management believes should be improved and corrected 
in addition to creating risks that information required to be reported in our sec filings is not timely recorded  processed and reported  these deficiencies increase the likelihood of misstatements in our financial statements or violations of law 
management has a remediation plan for these issues and is working to complete its remediation 
there can be no assurance  however  that all of the identified issues and significant deficiencies will be resolved 
any failure to remediate the deficiencies noted in connection with our audits or to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any such failure also could adversely affect the results of the periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act in the future 
ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could result in a lower trading price of our stock 

table of contents our business is capital intensive  and our ability to finance our business depends on generating sufficient cash flow from our operations 
we require substantial capital to fund our working capital  capital expenditures  and other cash needs 
our ability to generate cash depends on demand for construction services by the oil and gas industry as a result of the levels of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies and on competitive  general economic  financial  and many other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot provide assurance that we will always be able to generate sufficient operating cash flow to provide us with the working capital required to support our operations  and we may experience periodic cash demands that exceed our operating cash flow 
our failure to generate sufficient operating cash flow to provide adequate working capital would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
our investments in auction rate securities may be adversely impacted by liquidity risk 
we have invested a portion of our cash in auction rate securities 
our investments in auction rate securities may be adversely impacted by relatively illiquid markets 
our ability to sell these securities may be impaired due to the recent increase in failed auctions 
we may not be able to liquidate these securities in the immediate future or may be forced to sell them for less than what we might have otherwise have been able to  or both 
we may experience difficulties resolving claims and variation orders  which may adversely impact our cash flows 
in the ordinary course of our business  we must negotiate with our clients to resolve claims and change orders 
a claim is an amount in excess of the agreed contract price or amount not included in the original contract price that we seek to collect from our clients or others for client caused delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other causes of unanticipated additional costs 
a change order is a change to the scope of a project contract  which may be initiated by either us or our client 
when a variation to the project scope or specifications is required  it is customary that we continue to execute the project to completion although we may not have precise agreement with our client on the financial responsibilities of all parties 
if we are unable to resolve claims and change orders with our client satisfactorily  our profit and cash flow from the project could be adversely affected 
there might be delays or cancellation of projects included in our backlog 
as of december   our backlog of construction contracts amounted to approximately million 
the dollar amount of our backlog does not necessarily indicate future revenues or earnings related to the performance of that work 
although the backlog represents only business that we consider to be firm  cancellations  delays or scope adjustments have occurred in the past and are likely to occur in the future 
due to factors outside our control  such as changes in project scope and schedule  we cannot predict with certainty when or if projects included in our backlog will be performed 
we may experience equipment or mechanical failures  which could increase costs  reduce revenues and result in penalties for failure to meet project completion requirements 
the successful execution of contracts requires a high degree of reliability of our vessels  barges and equipment 
the average age of our fleet as of december  was twenty eight years 
breakdowns not only add to the costs of executing a project  but they can also delay the completion of subsequent contracts  which are scheduled to utilize the same assets 
we operate a scheduled maintenance program in order to keep all assets in good working order  but despite this breakdowns can occur 
our operations could suffer with the loss of one of our senior officers or other key personnel 
our success depends heavily on continued services of our senior management and key employees 
our officers and key personnel have extensive experience in our industry  so if we were to lose any of our key employees or executive officers  our operations could suffer 

table of contents our revenues are subject to a significant number of tax regimes  and changes in the tax legislation or the rules implementing tax legislation or the regulator enforcing those rules or legislation in any one of these countries could negatively and adversely affect our results of operations 
we operate in many countries and are therefore subject to the jurisdiction of numerous tax authorities  as well as cross border treaties between governments 
our operations in these countries are taxed on different bases  including net income  net income deemed earned  and revenue based withholding 
we determine our tax provision based on our interpretation of enacted local tax laws and existing practices  and use assumptions regarding the tax deductibility of items and recognition of revenue 
changes in these assumptions could impact the amount of income taxes that we provide for any given year and could adversely affect our result of operations 
our debt instruments contain covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility 
under the terms of our credit facility  we must maintain minimum levels of net worth and comply with  among other things  a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio 
our ability to meet the financial ratios and tests under our credit facility is affected  in part  by events beyond our control  and we may not be able to satisfy those ratios and tests

critical accounting policies significantly affect our reported financial results and conditions 
although our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments  such as the estimates used for the cost to complete projects under the percentage of completion method of project accounting 
these estimates and judgments have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates  and these policies are described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates  included elsewhere in this annual report 
actual amounts and results may differ materially from our estimates 
we have incurred losses in past years and may incur additional losses in the future which could adversely affect our operations 
in past years we have incurred losses from operations 
we may have operating losses in the future if we cannot obtain sufficient work and complete projects within our cost estimates 
operating losses could have significant adverse effects on our future operations including limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions  reducing our ability to withstand competitive pressures and impairing our ability to obtain financing to provide for future working capital needs and capital expenditures 
compliance with environmental and other governmental regulations could be costly and could negatively impact our operations 
our vessels and operations are subject to and affected by various types of governmental regulation including many international  federal  state and local environmental protection laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex and stringent  and compliance may become increasingly difficult and expensive 
we may be subject to significant fines and penalties for non compliance  and some environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for cleaning up spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances  regardless of whether we were negligent or at fault 
these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for our acts that complied with all applicable laws at the time we performed the acts 
adoption of laws or regulations that have the effect of curtailing exploration for and production of oil and natural gas in our areas of operation could adversely affect our operations by reducing demand for our services 
in addition  new laws or regulations  or changes to existing laws or regulations may increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations 

table of contents we limit foreign ownership of our company  which could reduce the price of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation limit the percentage of outstanding common stock and other classes of voting securities that non united states citizens can own 
applying the statutory requirements applicable today  our articles of incorporation provide that no more than of our outstanding common stock may be owned by non united states citizens 
these restrictions may at times preclude united states citizens from transferring their common stock to non united states citizens 
these restrictions may also limit the available market for resale of shares of common stock and for the issuance of shares by us and could adversely affect the price of our common stock

table of contents item legal proceedings during the fourth quarter of  we received a payroll tax assessment for the years through from the nigerian tax authorities in the amount of million 
the assessment alleges that certain expatriate employees  working on projects in nigeria  were subject to personal income taxes  which were not paid to the government 
we filed a formal objection to the assessment on november  we do not believe these employees are subject to the personal income tax assessed and believe this matter will ultimately have to be resolved by litigation 
however  we do not expect the ultimate resolution to have a material adverse effect on the company 
on february   we received a million tax assessment from algeria for income tax  business tax and value added tax for the years and we are indemnified by our client for the value added tax portion  which is approximately million  of the assessment 
we accrued income taxes for the algerian tax liability in conjunction with the project in and we engaged an outside tax counsel to assist us in resolving the tax assessment  and they are presently in discussions with the algerian tax authorities 
during the fourth quarter of  we reached a final resolution with the algerian tax authority for the income and the business tax portions of the assessment for approximately million  including penalties 
this amount has been fully reserved and will be paid in full during the first quarter of based on our outside tax counsel s discussions with the algerian tax authorities  we expect the value added tax assessment will be waived 
in june  the company announced that it was conducting an internal investigation of its west africa operations  focusing on the legality  under the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and local laws  of one of its subsidiary s reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by a customs agent in connection with shipments of materials and the temporary importation of vessels into west african waters 
the company further announced that the audit committee of the company s board of directors had engaged the law firm of mayer brown llp  an international law firm with significant experience in investigating and advising on fcpa matters  to lead the investigation 
the investigation is ongoing 
the audit committee began its internal investigation after management brought to the attention of the committee concerns about certain actions by a customs agent in connection with shipments of materials  obtaining temporary importation permits for its vessels into nigeria  and the settlement of the fcpa proceedings involving certain vetco gray entities 
in addition  the company s management and the audit committee were aware of press releases by three other companies disclosing that they are conducting internal investigations into the fcpa implications of certain actions by a customs agent in connection with the temporary importation of their vessels into nigeria 
the company s management considered it prudent to review the company s operations since it uses customs agents and the company s vessels that have operated in nigeria do so under temporary importation permits 
the company voluntarily contacted the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec and the us department of justice to advise them that an independent investigation is under way and that it intends to cooperate fully with both agencies 
the company received a subpoena from the sec requesting documents related to the company s dealings with the customs agent in question  focusing primarily on transactions in the company s west african operations  which indicates that the sec has opened a formal non public investigation into the matter 
the letter accompanying the sec subpoena states that the investigation and subpoena do not mean that the sec or its staff has concluded that any violation of law has occurred  nor does it mean that they have a negative opinion of any person  entity or security 
the company has been cooperating fully with both agencies in connection with the matter and will continue to do so 
special counsel to the audit committee for the investigation has and will continue to provide interim updates to the agencies and the audit committee as the investigation progresses 
at this stage of the internal investigation the company is unable to predict what conclusions  if any  the sec will reach or whether the department of justice will open a separate investigation to investigate this matter or what potential remedies these agencies may seek 
if the sec or department of justice determines that violations of the fcpa have occurred  they could seek civil and criminal sanctions  including monetary penalties  against us and or certain of our employees  as well as changes to our business practices and 
table of contents compliance programs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
in addition  such actions  whether actual or alleged  could damage our reputation and ability to do business 
further  detecting  investigating  and resolving these matters is expensive and consumes significant time and attention of our senior management 
based on information obtained to date in our internal investigation  we have not determined if any potential liability that may result is either probable or can be reasonably estimated 
as a result  we have not made any accrual in our financial statements at december  management and the audit committee will work with independent counsel and appropriate personnel within the company to implement promptly such measures as are considered appropriate 
we continue to use alternative procedures adopted after the commencement of the investigation to obtain nigerian temporary import permits 
these procedures are designed to assure fcpa compliance 
although we are still working and pursuing additional work in west africa  we have declined or terminated available projects and delayed the start of certain projects in nigeria in order to ensure fcpa compliance and appropriate security for our personnel and assets 
the possibility exists that we may have to curtail or cease our operations in nigeria if appropriate long tern solutions cannot be identified and implemented 
we have worldwide customer relationships and a mobile fleet  and we are prepared to redeploy vessels to other areas as necessary to assure the vessels are utilized to the fullest extent possible 
notwithstanding that the internal investigation is ongoing  we have concluded that certain changes to our compliance program would provide us with greater assurance that we are in compliance with the fcpa and its record keeping requirements 
we have had a long time published policy requiring compliance with the fcpa and broadly prohibiting any improper payments by us to foreign or domestic officials as well as training programs for our employees  we have since the commencement of the internal investigation adopted  and may adopt additional  measures intended to enhance our compliance procedures and ability to audit and confirm our compliance 
additional measures also may be required once the investigation concludes 
our operations are subject to the inherent risks of offshore marine activity including accidents resulting in the loss of life or property  environmental mishaps  mechanical failures  and collisions 
we insure against certain of these risks 
we believe our insurance should protect us against  among other things  the accidental total or constructive total loss of our vessels 
we also carry workers compensation  maritime employer s liability  general liability  and other insurance customary in our business 
all insurance is carried at levels of coverage and deductibles that we consider financially prudent 
recently  our industry has experienced a tightening in the builders risk market and the property market subject to named windstorms  which has increased deductibles and reduced coverage 
our services are provided in hazardous environments where accidents involving catastrophic damage or loss of life could result  and litigation arising from such an event may result in us being named a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims 
although there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance carried by our company is sufficient to protect us fully in all events  management believes that our insurance protection is adequate for our business operations 
a successful liability claim for which we are underinsured or uninsured could have a material adverse effect on the company 
we are involved in various routine legal proceedings primarily involving claims for personal injury under the general maritime laws of the united states and jones act as a result of alleged negligence 
we believe that the outcome of all such proceedings  even if determined adversely  would not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial statements

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion presents management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report 
results of operations general in july  we reorganized the underlying operations and economics of the operating segments 
as a result  the reportable segments were realigned to better reflect the current reporting structure of our internal management and to facilitate our growth strategy and renewed focus on diving and underwater services 
also effective with this reorganization  we renamed our diving services to subsea services to more accurately depict our expanding business beyond diving services to include diverless intervention  surf  and irm services 
the six reportable segments prior to this reorganization included gulf of mexico offshore construction division ocd  gulf of mexico diving  latin america  west africa  middle east including the mediterranean and india  and asia pacific 
the six revised reportable segments subsequent to the reorganization include gulf of mexico ocd  gulf of mexico subsea  latin america  west africa  middle east including the mediterranean and asia pacific india 
this reorganization is reflected as a retrospective change to the financial information and the narrative description in management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition presented for the years ended december   and  and consists of the following a geographical shift of india operations from the middle east to the asia pacific  transfer of a portion of subsea services from the middle east to west africa  and corporate interest income and expense no longer being allocated to the reportable segments 
the above organizational changes did not have an impact on equity  consolidated net income or consolidated cash flows 
our results of operations are affected by the overall level of activity of the offshore construction industry within each worldwide region in which we operate 
this overall level of offshore construction activity is principally determined by four factors the oil and gas industry s ability to economically justify placing discoveries of oil and gas reserves in production  the oil and gas industry s need to maintain  repair  and replace existing pipelines and structures to extend the life of production  the oil and gas industry s need to clear structures from the lease once the oil and gas reserves have been depleted  and weather events such as major hurricanes 
our results of operations ultimately reflect our ability to secure jobs through competitive bidding and manage those jobs to successful completion 
the competition and inherent operating risks vary between the worldwide regions in which we operate  and these challenges affect individual segment profitability 
our results of operations in terms of revenues  gross profit  and gross profit as a percentage of revenues margins are principally driven by three factors our level of offshore construction and subsea activity activity  pricing  which can be affected by contract mix pricing  and operating efficiency on any particular construction project productivity 
offshore construction services the level of our offshore construction activity in any given period has a significant impact on our results of operations 
the offshore construction business is capital and personnel intensive  and  as a practical matter  many of our costs  including the wages of skilled workers  are effectively fixed in the short run regardless of whether or not our vessels are being utilized in productive service 
in general  as activity increases  a greater proportion of these fixed costs are recovered through operating revenues  and  consequently  gross profit and margins increase 
conversely  as activity decreases  our revenues decline  but our costs do not decline proportionally  thereby constricting our gross profit and margins 
our activity level can be affected by 
table of contents changes in demand due to economic or other conditions in the oil and gas exploration industry  seasonal conditions in certain geographical areas  and or our ability to win the bidding for available jobs 
our results of operations depend heavily upon our ability to obtain  in a very competitive environment  a sufficient quantity of offshore construction contracts with sufficient gross profit margins to recover the fixed costs associated with our offshore construction business 
most of our offshore construction revenues are obtained through international contracts which are generally larger  more complex  and of longer duration than our typical domestic contracts 
most of these international contracts require a significant amount of working capital  are generally bid on a lump sum basis  and are secured by a letter of credit or performance bond 
operating cash flows may be negatively impacted during periods of escalating activity due to the substantial amounts of cash required to initiate these projects and the normal delays between cash expenditures by the company and cash receipts from the customer 
additionally  lump sum contracts for offshore construction services are inherently risky and are subject to many unforeseen circumstances and events that may affect productivity 
when productivity decreases with no offsetting decrease in costs or increases in revenues  our contract margins erode compared to our bid margins 
in general  we are required to bear a larger share of project related risks during periods of weak demand for our services and a smaller share of risk during periods of high demand for our services 
consequently  our revenues and margins from offshore construction services are subject to a high degree of variability  even as compared to other businesses in the offshore energy industry 
claims and change orders are a significant aspect of any construction business and are particularly significant in the offshore construction industry 
a claim is an amount in excess of the contract price which a construction contractor seeks to collect from customers or others due to delays  errors in specifications or design  unapproved change orders  or other causes of unanticipated costs caused by the customer or others 
a change order is a request to alter the performance of a previously agreed upon construction contract 
change orders may include changes in specifications or design  method or manner of performance  facilities  equipment  site  or the period for completion of the work 
change orders are common in our business due to the nature of offshore construction contracts and sometimes add to the degree of project execution difficulty 
a change order usually increases the scope of work but may also decrease the scope and  consequently  the amount of contract revenue and costs which are recognized 
either the customer or the company may initiate a change order 
at the time of initiation  a change order may be approved or unapproved by either party  priced or unpriced  or defined or undefined regarding detailed scope 
even when the scope of work is defined  the associated increase or decrease in contract revenue will often be governed by contract terms or negotiated later  sometimes after the work is performed 
subsea services most of our subsea revenues are the result of short term work  involve numerous smaller contracts  and are usually based on a day rate charge 
financial risks associated with these types of contracts are normally limited due to their short term and non lump sum nature 
however  some subsea contracts  especially those that utilize dsvs  may involve longer term commitments that extend from the exploration  design and installation phases of a field throughout its useful life by providing irm services 
the financial risks which are associated with these commitments remain low in comparison with our offshore construction activities due to the day rate structure of the contracts 
revenues and margins from our subsea activities tend to be more consistent than those from our offshore construction activities

depreciation and amortization in cost of operations 
the amount of depreciation and amortization expense  including the amortization of dry docking costs  included in our cost of operations for was million  compared to the million included in this decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily caused by a reduction in the amount of major construction vessel depreciation  resulting from lower utilization 
the amount of amortization related to stock based compensation and dry docking increased between the periods 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by million to million in  compared to  primarily due to lower revenues  as described above  and lower margins from our west africa segment  which were caused by incremental vessel costs that were predominately unrecovered project costs 
as a percentage of revenues  our overall gross profit margin decreased from in to in this decline in gross profit margin was primarily the result of lower utilization of our major construction vessels and lower profitability on projects in west africa 
loss on asset impairments

our effective tax rate for was compared to for this decline was primarily due to the mix of earnings from high to low taxable jurisdictions 
segment information the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our reportable segments during the twelve month periods ended december  and we determined it was preferable to reclassify segment information associated with the presentation of inter segment revenues between the gulf of mexico ocd and gulf of mexico subsea to correspond with the presentation 
the reclassifications had no impact on the consolidated statements of shareholders equity  operations or cash flows 
gulf of mexico offshore construction division revenues decreased to million in  compared to  primarily due to a lower level of activity in the region and pricing pressures 
there was an exceptionally high level of demand for the offshore construction services in the gulf of mexico during due to the damaging effects caused by hurricanes 
activity in was comprised of numerous projects that were related to hurricane repair work on offshore oil and gas platforms  compared to fewer  but larger projects in a high level of competition for offshore construction services was experienced in this area during that caused us to experience additional pricing pressures  compared to income before taxes decreased by million to million in  compared to  which was attributable to the same factors that caused lower revenues 
in addition  a million gain on the sale of a cargo barge and a million loss on the impairment of one major construction vessel and certain other unrelated ancillary construction equipment was recorded during gulf of mexico subsea revenues remained relatively the same between and revenues generated in were million  compared to million in a majority of the revenues generated during was comprised of salvage work 
project profitability improved between comparable years  partly due to good project execution and high utilization of the rem commander and pioneer for services that included plug and abandonment  pipeline repair and rov support 
the projects performed in were primarily for irm services 
income before taxes was relatively the same between comparable years or million in 
table of contents compared to million in in addition we recorded a million gain on the sale of three crew vessels and two dsvs in  and a million impairment loss on one dsv in latin america revenues decreased to million in  compared to  primarily due a lower level of activity in construction activity diminished during  compared to  during the completion stage of three large multi year projects that were fully active in although revenues declined  gross profit margins increased from in to in higher gross profit margins were achieved in primarily as a result of favorable resolutions of change orders that were recognized towards the completion of these large mutli year projects 
income before taxes declined from million in to million in in  the improved gross profit margins plus a lower allocation of corporate selling  general and administrative expenses based on lower activity reduced a substantial portion of the negative impact from lower revenues 
in addition  a million loss was recorded in for the impairment of three dsvs 
west africa revenues and demand for our services in this area remained relatively the same between and revenues generated in were million  compared to million in gross profit margins declined during compared to from to 
this deterioration was a result of lost project profitability and additional project costs that occurred when projects were abruptly suspended mid year when we experienced security and logistical issues in nigeria 
consequently  our fleet was demobilized from the area 
a portion of the project work  that was suspended  is expected to commence again in we also encountered additional project standby costs in as a result of delays in obtaining vessel permits for the area 
incremental vessel costs including mobilization and demobilization costs  standby costs and idle vessel costs totaled approximately million in income before taxes decreased from million in to a net loss of million in  which was primarily due to high vessel costs and increased allocations of corporate selling  general and administrative expenses 
middle east revenues increased by million to million in  compared to  primarily due to a high level of construction activity in the region due to an increase in demand 
we experienced high vessel utilization on three large construction projects  of which  two are multi year projects 
two major construction vessels and a dsv  the rem fortress  were transferred from other regions of the world to the middle east to support demand in the area 
in  activity consisted primarily of subsea services and a low level of construction activity 
gross profit margins improved from to reflecting an increase in vessel utilization and productivity 
net income before taxes improved by million to million in  compared to a net loss of million in  reflecting higher revenues and productivity 
results in were positively impacted by a million gain on the sale of a dsv 
results in were negatively impacted by a million impairment loss on one mcv and two dsvs  partly offset by a million gain on the sale of two dsvs 
asia pacific india revenues declined by to million in  compared to  primarily due to a decline in activity 
we experienced lower vessel utilization in this region during  compared to three major construction vessels from asia pacific india region were assigned to the middle east region during in  activity primarily consisted of work performed on two large construction projects  compared to the work performed on a large multi year project in supplemented by intersegment diving services 
gross profit margins remained relatively consistent from to the effects of lower activity in were partially offset by lower vessel costs due  in part  to mobilizing vessels to the middle east and west africa 
income before taxes decreased from million in  to million in  primarily due to lower construction activity in compared to a portion of the decrease in net income before taxes was offset by a million gain on the sale of a dsv in

pricing improved most significantly in our gulf of mexico subsea and latin america segments 
the entry into service of the rem commander also contributed to this increase in revenues 
worldwide utilization of our major construction vessels increased to in compared to in  and total diver days in our gulf of mexico subsea segment increased by between comparable years 
for a detailed discussion of revenues and income before taxes for each geographical area  please see segment information below 
depreciation and amortization in cost of operations 
the amount of depreciation and amortization expense  including the amortization of dry docking costs  included in our cost of operations for was million compared to the million included in this increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily caused by an increase in the amount of amortization related to stock based compensation and dry docking costs 
the amount of major construction vessel depreciation that was recorded on a units of production basis remained relatively constant between comparable years as a decline in the utilization of a few large vessels offset the general trend of higher utilization 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million to million in as a percentage of revenues  our overall gross profit margin increased to in from in this improvement in gross profit margin was the result of higher activity  improved pricing in certain segments  higher and more effective utilization of our major construction vessels  improved productivity  and the profitable incorporation of materials and subcontracted services into bids for projects executed in improvement in our latin america segment  especially with respect to pricing  productivity  and profitable subcontracting  had the most significant impact on our results of operations 
these improvements were partially offset by higher costs in certain segments  especially costs related to the retention of skilled labor and critical equipment and services during this period of high demand in our industry 

table of contents loss on asset impairments 
due to escalating costs and the lack of availability of replacement parts for certain ancillary construction equipment  we recorded in our results of operations for an aggregate impairment loss of million which resulted from the retirement of two major construction vessels  six dsvs  and other ancillary construction equipment 
for additional information regarding these impairments  please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
reduction in litigation provision 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a million reduction in our provision for the vinci litigation in connection with the full and final settlement of a litigation involving a share purchase agreement with vinci to purchase shares of etpm sa 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million to million in primarily due to increases in expenses related to stock based compensation  administrative labor  and professional fees 
the following factors contributed to the increase in these costs the adoption of sfas r  increased costs related to performance based compensation  costs associated with the transitional period related to the retirement of our founder  and ongoing securities regulation compliance costs 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for included a million provision in our latin america segment for penalties  interest and inflationary adjustments related to an assessment for income and value added taxes 
other expense or income 
other income increased by million to million in primarily due to higher interest income which was partially offset by an unfavorable variance with respect to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
interest income increased between comparable periods due to higher average cash balances and interest rates 
other income for also included million gain from our euro denominated forward foreign currency contracts 
during the fourth quarter of  we began recording in our earnings the changes in fair market value of certain derivative forward foreign currency contracts which became disqualified for hedge accounting due to changes in our expectations regarding the foreign currency commitments which constituted the hedged items required for such accounting 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate for was as compared to for this decline was primarily due to improved earnings in foreign jurisdictions with low statutory tax rates or deemed profits ie  percent of revenue regimes 
the effective tax rate for the prior year was substantially in excess of the us income tax rate of primarily due to low earnings and or losses in certain foreign jurisdictions which are taxed on a deemed profits ie  percentage of revenue basis and or net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we did not record a tax benefit 
segment information the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our reportable segments during the twelve month periods ended december  and we determined it was preferable to reclassify and segment information associated with the presentation of inter segment revenues between the gulf of mexico ocd and gulf of mexico subsea to correspond with the presentation 
the reclassifications had no impact on the consolidated statements of shareholders equity  operations or cash flows 
gulf of mexico offshore construction division revenues increased to million in primarily due to a substantial increase in activity 
demand for the offshore construction services provided by our gulf of mexico ocd segment increased between the comparable years ended december  and due to the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita and the high energy prices experienced during these years 
several vessels which had been temporarily relocated to other segments during returned to the gulf of mexico for work in during the first quarter of  the g p was returned to service after refurbishment following an extended period of idleness  and the pipeliner was removed from service and shortly thereafter permanently retired from service 
activity in was comprised of numerous projects which were primarily related to hurricane repairs 
many of these projects were performed on a day rate basis 
activity in included one large day rate project  numerous small projects during the first half of the year  and numerous projects for hurricane repairs which were initiated in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita 

table of contents income before taxes increased by to million in the beneficial effect of the increase in revenues described above was partially offset by increased cost allocations related to the return of vessels which had been temporarily relocated to other segments during the prior year period  increased costs related to the retention and hiring of skilled workers  higher prices for critical equipment and services  especially third party support tugs  due to high demand  increased costs for insurance  and an increase in the proportion of corporate expenses allocated to this segment 
financial results for also include a million gain on the sale of a cargo barge and a million loss on the impairment of one major construction vessel and certain other unrelated ancillary construction equipment 
gulf of mexico subsea revenues increased by million to million in primarily due to an increase in activity and improved pricing 
due to the same factors which drove demand for our gulf of mexico ocd segment  demand for the services performed by our gulf of mexico subsea segment also increased significantly between the comparable years ended december  and the entry into service of the rem commander also added approximately million to revenues in prices trended higher during the first nine months of and remained firm during the fourth quarter 
income before taxes increased by million to million in  primarily due to the increase in the overall level of activity 
the beneficial effect of improved pricing on profit margins was partially offset by higher labor costs due to wage increases required to retain skilled divers  supervisors  and other personnel during a period of strong demand  increased use of higher cost contract divers and other contract labor due to a shortage of qualified personnel  higher prices for equipment rentals and outside services due to strong demand  and higher repairs and maintenance expense due to high vessel utilization 
financial results for also include a million gain on the sale of three crewboats and two dsvs as well as a million loss on the impairment of one dsv 
latin america revenues increased by to million in primarily due to improved bid margins  more effective utilization of our major construction vessels  and an increase in amount of materials and subcontracted services content in projects performed in there were two large projects with significant activity during compared to six smaller projects with significant activity during income before taxes improved by million to million in primarily due to a substantial improvement in productivity  improved bid margins  and the profitable incorporation of materials and subcontracted services into the projects performed in the productivity issues of uncompensated weather related downtime and barge transfer costs which were experienced in this segment during did not recur in  however  results for were negatively impacted by a shortage of skilled diving personnel which necessitated the use of a contract diving service for a significant portion of the diving work performed in this segment during financial results for also include a million loss on the impairment of three dsvs 
west africa revenues increased by million to million in primarily due to an increase in activity 
there were five projects with significant activity in compared to only two projects with significant activity in income before taxes improved by million to million in compared to a loss of million in primarily due to the beneficial effects of increased activity on gross profit and margins which were partially offset by higher costs for support vessels and repairs and maintenance as well as productivity issues on one project in financial results for the prior year were negatively impacted by fixed costs which were not recovered due to a lack of substantial activity in the region 
middle east revenues decreased by million to million in primarily due to lower level of construction activity 
the activity level dropped after the completion of one significant project in second quarter of and remained low throughout activity during consisted mainly of third party subsea services 
income before taxes decreased by million to a loss of million in primarily due to lower revenues 
financial results for were negatively impacted by a million loss on the impairment of one major construction vessel the tonkawa  two dsvs  and other ancillary construction equipment 

table of contents additionally  financial results for the prior year included a million gain on the disposition of a cargo barge 
asia pacific india revenues increased by to million in primarily due to higher activity 
in  activity in this segment primarily consisted of work performed on several large multi year projects predominantly off the coast of india 
in  one of the large multi year projects finished in had a higher level of activity and was supplemented by activity on several smaller projects and work performed on a day rate basis 
income before taxes increased by million to million in  primarily due to the increase in activity and greater project profitability 
the favorable effects of higher activity and profitability were partially offset by unrecovered costs associated with the rem fortress and the hercules 
the rem fortress  a newly built dive support vessel which was delivered at the beginning of the fourth quarter under long term charter  remained idle all quarter during initial rig up 
additionally  our asia pacific segment carried the cost of the mobilization of the hercules to west africa 
financial results for also include a million net gain on asset disposals which was primarily related to the sale of two dsvs 

table of contents industry and business outlook we believe that demand for our offshore construction and subsea services will remain strong over the next few years 
energy prices remain at high levels which are conducive to the offshore energy industry  and worldwide trends in energy consumption indicate growing demand for oil and natural gas 
additionally  we believe that current levels of offshore oil and gas exploration activity will create significant demand for our services over the next several years 
although we have been experiencing pricing pressures and reduced activity in our domestic operations  we are optimistic about the opportunities in the gulf of mexico during our outlook for demand for our offshore construction and subsea services continues to be positive for our international regions  especially in the middle east and latin america 
we expect the demand for our construction services for west africa will improve during  compared to certain projects that were suspended there in  due to security issues  are expected to commence again in however  these projects are susceptible to political and logistical challenges in nigeria 
we are encouraged by the new demand for our construction services in brazil  however  in  we do not expect to repeat the same high level of profitability on projects from our latin america segment that we experienced during as of december   our backlog totaled approximately million million for international regions and million for the gulf of mexico 
this backlog is scheduled to be performed in the amount of our backlog in the us gulf of mexico is not a reliable indicator of the level of demand for our services in this region due to the prevalence of short term contractual arrangements in this region 
we are encouraged with our backlog as the bidding activity is high 
liquidity and capital resources overview cash generated from operations and proceeds received from issuing million of senior convertible debentures provided the major source of funds in the generated cash and offering proceeds sufficiently funded stock repurchases and the continued growth of the business  including capital expenditures for expanding and modernizing our fleet of vessels 
the primary uses of cash during have been for investing in marketable securities  repurchasing common stock and capital spending 
we had firm capital commitments on projects  which were in progress at december   of approximately million  of which  million is expected to be incurred during total capital expenditures for are currently expected to be between million and million  and will be utilized primarily for expanding and modernizing our fleet of vessels 
the actual capital expenditures for may differ from our expectations due to changes in existing capital project schedules and or projected capital projects 
cash flows operating activities our cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at december   compared to december  cash generated from our operating activities increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december the increase in compared to was primarily attributable to the net decrease in the major working capital components that provided million of cash in  compared to net increase in that used million of cash 
the effects of the positive cash flow in were partly offset by lower net income of million and a decrease in the non cash provision for doubtful accounts 
investing activities investing activities used million of cash in  compared to million in the increase in cash used by investing activities in was primarily attributable to investing million in marketable securities and spending million on capital expenditures 
the majority of the capital expenditures in were for upgrades on vessels and diving systems and the construction of a mcv  designated as the global 
table of contents financing activities financing activities provided million of cash in and million in the cash provided in primarily reflected the gross proceeds of million from the issuance of senior convertible debentures in july approximately million of these proceeds were simultaneously used to purchase million shares of our common stock 
long term debt our long term debt outstanding includes million of senior convertible debentures which carry an interest rate of per annum with semi annual interest payments 
these debentures are convertible into cash  and if applicable  into shares of the company s common stock 
we also maintain million of title xi bonds outstanding which carry an interest rate of per annum and semi annual principal payments of approximately million payable each february and august until maturity in as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility provides a borrowing capacity of million and an optional provision for expansion of million 
as of december   our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was reduced by million of letters of credit  and  consequently our available borrowings were million 
other indebtedness and obligations we also have a million short term credit facility at one of our foreign locations  which is secured by a letter of credit issued under our primary credit facility 
at december   we had million in cash overdrafts reflected in accounts payable  million of letters of credit outstanding  and million of credit availability under this particular credit facility 
charters we have a long term charter for the titan  a foot self propelled twin hulled derrick ship 
the vessel charter payments are approximately million annually 
the charter term is months expiring in august this charter can be canceled by us at anytime  subject to a termination penalty of the transfer to the vessel owner of title to our dynamic positioning dp system used on the vessel 
the dp system was purchased and installed on the titan  at our cost  during the first quarter of for a total cost of million 
we have two long term charters for dsvs which were delivered in the first dsv charter  the rem commander  includes a fixed term five year lease with five annual options  and requires monthly payments denominated in norwegian kroners at an annual rate of approximately million kroners or million as of december  
the second dsv charter  the rem fortress  includes a fixed term three year lease with four annual options  and requires monthly payments denominated in norwegian kroners at an annual rate of approximately million kroners or million as of december  
as of december   we had entered into forward foreign currency contracts that have enabled us to fulfill our remaining non cancellable norwegian kroner obligations under these charters at an average rate of kroners per us dollar

the contractual obligations reported above exclude our liability of million recognized under fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
related to our provision for uncertain tax positions 
we have excluded such amounts as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business with customers  vendors and others  we have entered into off balance sheet arrangements 
we provide guarantees and performance  bid  and payment bonds pursuant to agreements  or in connection with bidding  to obtain such agreements to perform construction services 
the aggregate amount of these guarantees and bonds at december  was million in surety bonds and million in bank guarantees and or letters of credit 
the surety bonds  and bank guarantees letters of credit are due to expire between january and february and between january and october  respectively 

table of contents liquidity outlook during the next twelve months  we expect that our balances of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  supplemented by cash generated from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our operations including increases in working capital required to fund any increases in activity levels  scheduled debt retirement  conversion of our debentures  if applicable  and currently planned capital expenditures 
we recently announced an upgrade to our fleet with the construction of a new generation derrick pipelay vessel  designated the global  for an estimated cost of million 
the global is expected to be operational in in addition  we will continue with vessel upgrades and to evaluate the divesture of assets that are no longer critical to our operations to reduce our operating costs and maintain our strong financial position 
as we have done historically  we regularly evaluate the merits of opportunities that arise for the acquisition of equipment or businesses and may require additional liquidity if we decide to pursue such opportunities 
the credit markets are currently experiencing significant uncertainty  and some of this uncertainty has impacted the markets where auction rate securities of municipalities that we have invested in would be offered 
we are unable to estimate the impact  if any  which emerging credit market conditions may have on the liquidity of our investment in auction rate securities 
we do not believe any reduction in liquidity of our investment in auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall liquidity 
we believe the million carrying value of the auction rate securities we owned at december  is not impaired  but we may have to reclassify the investment from short term to long term investments if future liquidity conditions mandate 
over the next few years  we expect cash from operations  supplemented by proceeds from long term debt and or equity issuances  to provide sufficient funds to finance our operations  maintain our fleet  and expand our business as opportunities arise 
our long term liquidity will be determined by our ability to earn operating profits which are sufficient to cover our fixed costs  including scheduled principal and interest payments on debt  and to provide a reasonable return on shareholders investment 
we believe that earning such operating profits will enable us to maintain access to favorably priced debt  equity  and or other financing arrangements which may be required to finance our operations  maintain our fleet  and or expand our business 
our ability to earn operating profits in the long run will be determined by  among other things  the continued viability of the oil and gas energy industry  commodity price expectations for crude oil and natural gas  the competitive environment of the markets in which we operate  and our ability to win bids and manage awarded projects to successful completion

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from construction contracts  which are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method  are measured by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the current estimated total cost of the project the cost to cost option of the percentage of completion method 
the use of this method is based on our experience to be able to make reasonably dependable estimates of the cost to complete our projects 
total estimated costs are affected by operating efficiency  change in expected cost of materials and labor  adverse market conditions  and other factors that could affect the timing of revenue recognition and or 
table of contents the overall profitability of a project 
significant changes in cost estimates could possibly result in a contract loss 
anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in full in the period in which they become evident 
in addition  we include claims and unapproved change orders  to the extent of costs incurred  in contract revenues when the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim  additional costs are not the result of deficiencies in our performance  costs are identifiable  and evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
we actively negotiate our claims and change orders with our customers and the outcome of the negotiations has an impact on profitability of the project 
we continually monitor and assess the collectibility of our contract revenues and receivables  and make the appropriate allowances when necessary 
receivables our receivables include billed and unbilled receivables  and often include claims and changes orders 
we recognize claims and unapproved change orders to the extent of costs incurred  and when we believe collection is probably and reasonably estimated 
we continually monitor and evaluate our receivables for collectibility 
when we become aware of an uncollectible receivable  a specific reserve for bad debt expense is estimated and recorded  which reduces the receivable balance 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses 
property and equipment long lived assets held and used primarily marine vessels and related equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values of an asset group can be recovered through projected net cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  based on expected operating results over the remaining life of the asset group 
the cash flow estimates are based on historical data adjusted for management estimates of future market performance that rely on existing market data  industry wide trends  and expected vessel day rates  utilization  and margins 
management s estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market conditions  poor operating results  or other factors that could result in our inability to recover the current carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we depreciate major construction vessels using the units of production method based on the estimated operating days of each vessel 
our depreciation expense calculated under the units of production method may be less than  equal to or greater than depreciation expense calculated under the straight line method in any period 
the annual depreciation based on estimated operating days of each vessel will be at least of annual straight line depreciation and of cumulative straight line depreciation 
impairment of goodwill the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
recoverability is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value  including goodwill  of that reporting unit 
changes in assumptions required to estimate the present value of the excess earnings could materially impact the fair value estimate 
income taxes deferred tax assets in excess of related valuation reserves require considerable judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
historically  changes to valuation allowances have been caused by major changes in the business cycle in certain countries and changes in local country law 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 

table of contents we operate in many countries under various legal forms 
as a result  we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities  as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments 
our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases actual income before taxes  deemed profits which are generally determined using a percentage of revenues rather than profits and withholding taxes based on revenue 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events  such as the amount  timing  and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law  and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restriction or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
our tax filings for various periods are subjected to audit by tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business 
these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts 
we believe that these assessments may occasionally be based on arbitrary and even erroneous interpretations of local tax law 
we have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals and or litigation regarding these matters 
we have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings 
we believe we have substantial defenses to the questions being raised and will pursue all legal remedies should an unfavorable outcome result 
however  resolution of these matters involves uncertainties  and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable 
in certain situations  we provide for taxes where assessments have not been received 
in those situations  we consider it more likely than not the taxes ultimately payable will not exceed those amounts reflected in filed tax returns 
accordingly  taxes are provided in those situations under the guidance in the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
future events  such as changes in the facts or tax law  judicial decisions regarding existing law or a favorable audit outcome  may later indicate the assertion of additional taxes is no longer more likely than not to occur 
in such circumstances  it is possible that taxes previously provided would be released 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to the international nature of our business operations and the interest rate fluctuation  we are exposed to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency risk most of our business operations are conducted in foreign countries that use different currencies 
as such  we use natural hedging techniques to manage the foreign exchange risks associated with our foreign operations by contracting  to the extent possible  international construction jobs to be payable in us dollars 
we also  to the extent possible  maintain cash balances at foreign locations in us dollar accounts 
we do not believe that a change in currency rates in the regions in which we operate would have a significant effect on our results of operations 
from time to time  we also make significant contractual commitments which are denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had significant contractual commitments which were denominated in euros and norwegian kroners 
we entered into forward foreign currency contracts  for non trading purposes  to mitigate our currency risk  as further described 
our norwegian kroner commitments at december   which result from two long term vessel charters  will require the use of million kroners or million as of december  over the next three years 
as of december   we had hedged all of our non cancellable norwegian kroner commitments related to these vessel charters at an average rate of kroners per dollar
