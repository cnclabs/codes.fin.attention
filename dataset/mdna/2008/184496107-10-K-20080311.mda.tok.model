throughout north america  we perform environmental services through a network of service locations  and operate incineration facilities  commercial landfills  wastewater treatment operations  and transportation  storage and disposal facilities  as well as polychlorinated biphenyls pcb management facilities and oil and used oil products recycling facilities 
we seek to be recognized by customers as the premier supplier of a broad range of value added environmental services based upon quality  responsiveness  customer service  information technologies  breadth of product offerings and cost effectiveness 
the wastes handled include materials that are classified as hazardous because of their unique properties  as well as other materials subject to federal and state environmental regulation 
we provide final treatment and disposal services designed to manage hazardous and nonhazardous wastes which cannot be economically recycled or reused 
we transport  treat and dispose of industrial wastes for commercial and industrial customers  health care providers  educational and research organizations  other environmental services companies and governmental entities 
our technical services segment collects and transports containerized and bulk waste  performs categorization  specialized repackaging  treatment and disposal of laboratory chemicals and household hazardous wastes  which are referred to as cleanpack services  and offers apollo onsite services  which customize environmental programs at customer sites 
this is accomplished through the network of service centers where a fleet of trucks  rail or other transport is dispatched to pick up customers waste either on a pre determined schedule or on demand  and then to deliver waste to a permitted facility 
from the service centers  chemists can also be dispatched to a customer location for the collection of chemical waste for disposal 
our site services segment provides highly skilled experts utilizing specialty equipment and resources to perform services  such as industrial maintenance  surface remediation  groundwater restoration  site and facility decontamination  emergency response  site remediation  pcb disposal and oil disposal at the customer s site or another location 
these services are dispatched on a scheduled or emergency basis 
in january  ensco caribe  inc  a puerto rico corporation ensco caribe then owned by clean harbors el dorado  llc ch el dorado and by ochoa industrial sales corporation ochoa  redeemed the stock ownership of ochoa for million  of which  was placed in escrow for a period of months as security for the representations and warranties of ochoa 
immediately after the redemption  ensco caribe was owned by ch el dorado  the name ensco caribe  inc was changed to clean harbors caribe  inc  and the puerto rico operations of clean harbors environmental services  inc were transferred to clean harbors caribe  inc in august  we acquired certain assets owned by romic environmental technologies corporation romic  which specializes in collection and recycling of both hazardous and non hazardous waste materials  for million in cash  a reduction of receivables owed by romic to the company of million  an estimated million of direct acquisition costs  and an estimated incremental purchase price amount of million that is based upon of revenues generated from romic customers for the six month period subsequent to the acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
the following are the areas that we believe require the greatest amount of judgments or estimates in the preparation of the financial statements revenue allowance  deferred revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for landfills  testing long lived assets and goodwill for impairment  environmental liabilities  insurance expense  legal matters  and provision for income taxes 
our management discusses each of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors prior to each release of our annual financial statements 
revenue allowance 
due to the nature of our business and the complex invoices that result from the services provided  customers may withhold payments and attempt to renegotiate amounts invoiced 
accordingly  we establish a revenue allowance to cover the estimated amounts of revenue adjustments that may need to be credited to customers accounts in future periods 
the allowance is established based on specific review of particular customers  historical trends and other relevant information 
revenues allowance estimates can differ materially from the actual adjustments but historically our allowance has been adequate 
deferred revenue 
as is the customary practice in the environmental services industry  we submit a bill for services shortly after waste is collected from a customer location and prior to completion of the waste disposal process 
we recognize revenue for waste disposal services only when the waste is placed into a landfill  incinerated  treated in a wastewater treatment facility or shipped to a third party for disposal 
deferred revenue  representing amounts invoiced to customers for waste not yet processed  stated on our balance sheet as of december  was million 
because a large quantity of waste is on hand and in transit at the end of any month  waste from various sources is mixed subsequent to receipt  waste is received in various size containers  and the amount of waste per container can vary significantly  the calculation of deferred revenue requires the use of significant estimates such as the average revenue charged for a type of waste and the average waste volume contained within various size containers 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover accounts receivable that may not be collectible 
in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze the collectibility of accounts that are large or past due 
in addition  we consider historical bad debts and current economic trends in evaluating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable written off in subsequent periods can differ materially from the allowance for doubtful accounts provided  but historically our provision has been adequate 
accounting for landfills 
we amortize landfill improvements and certain landfill related permits over their estimated useful lives 
the units of consumption method is used to amortize land  landfill cell construction  asset retirement costs and remaining landfill cells and sites 
we also utilize the units of consumption method to record closure and post closure obligations for landfill cells and sites 
under the units of consumption method  we include future estimated construction and asset retirement costs  as well as costs incurred to date  in the amortization base 
additionally  where appropriate  we include probable expansion airspace that has yet to be permitted in the calculation of the total remaining useful life of the landfill 
this accounting method requires us to make estimates and assumptions  as described below 
any changes in our estimates will impact our income from operations prospectively from the date the changes are made 
it is possible that any of our estimates or assumptions could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from actual results 
in some cases we may be unsuccessful in obtaining an expansion permit or we may determine that an expansion permit that we previously thought was probable has become unlikely 
to the extent that such estimates  or the assumptions used to make those estimates  prove to be significantly different than actual results or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner  the costs of the landfill  including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion  may be subject to impairment testing  as described below  and lower prospective profitability may be experienced due to increased interest accretion and depreciation or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace 
long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections and anticipated future cash flows 
when indicators of potential impairment are present  the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future discounted cash flows of the underlying business 
an impairment in the carrying value of an asset is recognized whenever anticipated future cash flows discounted from an asset are estimated to be less than its carrying value 
the amount of the impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value 
fair values are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
goodwill 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually and as triggering events occur 
in making this assessment  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
environmental liabilities 
we have accrued environmental liabilities  as of december   of approximately million  substantially all of which we assumed as part of the acquisition of the csd assets in september and teris llc in august we anticipate such liabilities will be payable over many years and that cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund the payment of such liabilities when required 
however  events not now anticipated such as future changes in environmental laws and regulations could require that such payments be made earlier or in greater amounts than currently anticipated 
closure and post closure liabilities the changes to closure and post closure liabilities for the year ended december  were as follows in thousands landfill retirement liability non landfill retirement liability total balance at january     new asset retirement obligations   accretion   changes in estimates recorded to statement of operations other changes in estimates recorded to balance sheet settlement of obligations currency translation  reclassifications and other balance at december     the million benefit from changes in estimates above  recorded to the statement of operations  including a million benefit for the three months ended december  was due to i an increase in utilization of a facility thus avoiding projected near term closure million  ii a decrease in the cell closure cost estimate for a full cell million  and iii delayed timing of completing cell closure for a landfill cell million 
all of the landfill facilities included in the amounts shown above were active as of december  remedial liabilities as of december   we had recorded discounted remedial liabilities of million 
we also estimate that it is reasonably possible as that term is defined in sfas no 
more than remote but less than likely  that the amount of such remedial liabilities could be up to million greater than such million 
the changes to remedial liabilities for the year ended december  were as follows in thousands remedial liabilities for landfill sites remedial liabilities for inactive sites remedial liabilities including superfund for non landfill operations total balance at january      adjustment due to final purchase price allocation  accretion    changes in estimates recorded to statement of operations settlement of obligations    currency translation  reclassifications and other balance at december     the net million detriment from changes in estimates recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations primarily includes i proposed legal settlements and regulatory compliance obligations of million  offset by ii revised estimates based on new site information million  and iii the discounting effect of delays in certain remedial projects million 
this includes a million detriment for the three months ended december  insurance expense 
it is our policy to retain a significant portion of certain expected losses related primarily to workers compensation  health insurance  comprehensive general and vehicle liability 
accruals are established for incurred losses based on information that is known at the time 
recording health insurance expense requires that estimates be made of the cost of health benefits to be provided in future periods 
actual expenditures required in future periods can differ materially from accruals established based on estimates
