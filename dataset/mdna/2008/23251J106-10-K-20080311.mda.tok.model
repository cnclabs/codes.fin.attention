market characteristics in  forrester research estimated the us online ecommerce market to be billion  a ten year compounded annual growth rate agr of 
according to forrester research  ecommerce in europe has grown over the last ten years at a agr  to billion in for  the us census bureau reported in february that online sales by us retailers grew by over this compares to a total retail sales growth of 
for the fourth quarter of the us census bureau estimated that online sales of us retailers comprised of total us retail sales  up from in the fourth quarter of as the online ecommerce market continues to grow  selling online has become a strategic business strategy component for many organizations 
although credit cards have long been the dominant payment method available to online purchasers  alternative consumer payment options and cultural preferences have impacted the global payment environment 
a wide spectrum of payment options  such as debit cards  electronic checks  and online payment innovations such as bill me later and paypal are emerging worldwide 
since  we have experienced a noticeable trend among some of our large us customers seeking greater access into international markets  especially europe and china 
conducting online commerce internationally involves supporting more payment types  currency conversions  new payment processors  and mitigating higher fraud risk 
online fraud has evolved into an organized and systemic threat to online merchants 
the latest cybersource fraud survey  sponsored by cybersource and conducted by mindwave research in october  concluded that dollar losses from ecommerce fraud continue to grow diverting approximately billion from us ecommerce in  a increase over according to the survey  the percent of revenue that merchants say they will lose to fraud remained stable from to both years  but because ecommerce sales continue to grow  dollar losses to us ecommerce grow proportionately 
merchants are increasing the number of fraud detection tools they use to manage payment fraud risk 
in june  in the us  visa and mastercard began requiring compliance with a comprehensive security requirement called the payment card industry data security standard pci to limit the threat of cardholder information theft 
with the challenge of becoming pci compliant  some merchants are instead using cybersource to manage sensitive customer information such as credit card numbers and related transaction data 
for merchants that subscribe to secure storage or hosted payment acceptance services  cybersource handles and stores all payment data on behalf of the merchants in pci certified processing centers that connect directly with the banking network 
cybersource is evaluated once annually for pci  and has been verified as compliant for additionally  cybersource conducts quarterly threat assessment tests and employs rigorous security measures to prevent unauthorized access or security breaches 
online merchants are also focusing on meeting regulatory requirements in areas such as collection of sales taxes 
european union directives require that all online sellers of digital goods collect the applicable value added tax for sales in the european union 
the impact of these trends is that epayment management is becoming more complex 
online merchants must maintain technical and financial connections with a number of different payment processors and service providers  integrate these disparate connections with a number of internal business systems  allocate manual resources to keep pace with the growth of online sales  and comply with statutory and card association requirements 
cybersource enables its customers to meet these requirements simply and cost effectively with its epayment management solution

enterprise merchants have high sales volumes and generally demand the greatest range of payment options and the most sophisticated risk and management tools

we acquired bidpay 
com from first data corporation on march  and the service was re launched in june technology transaction services cybersource operates two transaction processing platforms  one for enterprise merchants and one for small business customers 
they are a modular architecture designed for scalability  reliability  extensibility and performance 
these systems are composed of multiple groups of servers and routers that appear as a single point of contact to our customers systems 
our transaction processing systems manage workflow functions and the required communications between our servers  our database  and our processors  including american express  barclays bank  chase paymentech solutions  first data corporation  global payment systems  streamline international a division of the royal bank of scotland group  tsys acquiring solutions and others 
these systems also utilize the latest industry standards to maximize compatibility with our customers commerce systems 
in addition  we have implemented a global network of telecommunications access points that are designed to optimize transaction processing response times and to mitigate the effects of system failures 
the primary software components of our two systems are the respective client software  order processing apis  commerce services applications  transaction databases and data warehouses 
client software our commerce services are invoked by a common programming interface residing on our customers commerce servers 
for our enterprise platform  client software is offered in two protocols  simple commerce messaging protocol scmp and order processing api  and can be easily installed by customers using pre built developer kits and application plug ins 
these developer kits are available for most popular programming environments  including asp com  
net  java and others  and for most operating systems  including windows nt  linux  and unix solaris  hp ux  ibm aix and others 
developer kits also come with samples that customers can use to quickly deploy cybersource services within their enterprises 
order processing api using web services for our enterprise platform  we offer the cybersource order processing api to enable the secure and reliable communication of order data from our customers systems to cybersource systems 
the order processing api provides our customers with a way to send invoice data to cybersource for processing by any of the cybersource commerce services applications 
using industry standard web services technologies  including soap  xml  and ws security  the order processing api provides customers with an industry recognized implementation path allowing the order processing api to be built into customer order management applications 
the order processing api uses the data encryption standard  rsa public key cryptography and digital certificates to ensure secure signed communication of transaction data 
we also developed scmp to enable efficient and secure connections between our systems and our customers systems 
in order to ensure secure messaging  scmp utilizes industry standards for secure communications including the data encryption standard  rsa public key cryptography and digital certificates 
scmp has been designed so that it can be integrated into virtually any commerce server platform 
for our small business platform  there are several methods for connecting web sites  moto  and point of sale systems to the payment gateway 
web merchants have the flexibility to choose which connection method best fits their payment acceptance infrastructure 
connection methods are advanced integration method aim and server implementation method sim 
aim is a merchant initiated server to server connection for submitting transactions to the payment gateway 
aim employs industry standard secure data encryption technology bit ssl protocol 
additional features include transaction key authentication  merchant control over all phases of the customer s online transaction experience  and configurable transaction response that integrate with merchant applications 
sim is a solution for web merchants with basic customization needs 
the authorize 
net payment gateway handles all the steps in the secure transaction process payment data collection  data submission and the response to the customer 
additional features of sim include a payment gateway hosted payment form employing bit ssl data encryption  transaction digital fingerprints to enhance security  and a customizable payment gateway hosted payment form and or receipt page 
moto merchants can submit transactions manually via a secure web browser using the virtual terminal or batch upload tool 
retail merchants can process transactions using the authorize 
net vpos 
additionally  there are approximately third party certified products  including shopping carts  kiosks  and mobile and software solutions that have integrated their ecommerce solution with the small business payment gateway 
these integrated solutions provide merchants with easy to implement checkout page solutions or hardware and software that are already integrated with the payment processing gateway 
commerce services applications we have developed and licensed a set of software applications that perform the hosted services 
in many cases  execution of the applications are distributed among the processing systems and database systems  enabling us to minimize interruptions during scheduled maintenance  code pushes  and system modifications 
for our enterprise platform  these services include credit card processing  electronic check processing  order decision management  gift and promotional certificates  bill me later payment service  payer authentication  paypal  cybersource advanced fraud screen enhanced by visa  tax services  delivery address verification  and export compliance 
for our small business platform  these services include echeck 
net  automated recurring billing  fraud detection suite  customer information manager  and virtual point of sale 
transaction database architecture two primary sets of databases form the core of our transaction processing system the transaction processing databases  which maintain information necessary to process each individual transaction  and the post transaction database  which generates and provides detailed information about customers transactions  with advanced reporting capabilities available in xml and other formats 
data centers and network access our data centers are located at facilities in san jose  california  seattle  washington  denver  colorado  phoenix  arizona  london  england  and tokyo  japan 
these secure data center facilities contain our servers  network firewalls  routers and other technology necessary to provide high availability transaction services and connectivity to the internet  our customers and processing partners 
the data centers provide high speed and redundant network connectivity  uninterruptible power systems  fire detection and suppression systems  physical security and surveillance on a hours a day  days a week  days a year basis 
in addition  we have access to numerous network points of presence located on five continents from third party providers  enhancing our ability to serve customers globally 
these points of presence  through controlled route announcements to providers such as abovenet  at t  cable wireless  glbx  level communications  sprint  telia  uu net and verio enable us to provide direct  rapid and reliable access to our suite of services 
industry standards the implementation of our architecture for hosted services is based on and complies with widely accepted industry standards 
for example  our transaction processing systems utilize components from industry leaders such as cisco  hewlett packard  ibm  microsoft  red hat  rsa data security  sun microsystems and sybase 
adherence to industry standards provides compatibility with existing applications  ease of modification  and reduces the need for software modules to be rewritten over time  thus protecting our customers investments 
enterprise software cybersource payment manager the cybersource payment manager product is based on modular systems architecture that allows this server to be installed into large customer infrastructures where a dedicated payment gateway interface will be used 
the cybersource payment manager is designed as a three layer software architecture well suited for enterprise deployment 
these layers include the multiple sales channel interface  core server  and database 
the cybersource payment manager core server supports a common programming interface that can be adapted to multiple sales channel enterprise systems 
these sales systems could be used in conjunction with a call center in order to accept orders through an interactive voice response unit  from a web server using hypertext transfer protocol  from a point of sale terminal  or from a wireless application protocol device 
the database layer is based on a standard structured query language interface  offering a choice of implementations with any of the standard relational database management systems on the market 
database platforms currently used by our customers include microsoft sql server  oracle  and sybase 
product development our product development team is responsible for the design  development  and release of our software and core infrastructure for services 
we emphasize quality assurance throughout our development lifecycle 
we believe that a strong emphasis placed on analysis and design early in the project lifecycle reduces the number and costs of defects that may be found in later stages 
when appropriate  we utilize third parties to expand the capacity and technical expertise of our internal product development organization 
on occasion  we have licensed third party technology that we feel provides the strongest technical alternative 
we believe this approach shortens time to market without compromising our competitive position or product quality 
as of december   we employed persons in our product development department 
intellectual property our success depends upon our proprietary technology and licensed technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we have been issued eight patents and have thirty patent applications pending 
the issued patents cover much of the technology we employ  including fraud detection  cryptography  digital certificates  stored value services  and digital software distribution 
we have pending patent applications covering cryptography  order management  digital delivery  stored value services  fraud detection  and digital delivery 
we investigate  define  and prepare applications for new patents as a part of the standard product development cycle 
our product development and legal management teams meet on a regular basis to harvest new inventions 
we cannot assure that any patent application that we file will issue as a patent  and we cannot assure that any patent issued to us will not be held invalid or unenforceable based on prior art or for any other reason 
some of our technology is designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties 
while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods  we believe  based upon past experience and industry practice  that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms  however  there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all 
we believe that numerous patent applications relating to the internet commerce field have been filed or have been issued as patents 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may become aware of one or more patents of third parties that we choose to evaluate for a variety of purposes 
these purposes may include determining the general contents of patents  reviewing the technological developments of their assignees  and determining whether our technology may overlap 
we have not conducted searches to determine whether any of our services or technology could be alleged to infringe upon any patent rights of any third party 
we cannot assure that none of our products  services  and technology infringes any patent of any third party 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  contractors  vendors  potential customers and alliances and  our license agreements with our customers  with respect to our software  services  documentation and other proprietary information  contain confidentiality obligations 
despite these precautions  third parties could reverse engineer  copy or otherwise obtain our technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our intellectual property or software exists 
software piracy is a prevalent problem in our industry 
effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
we cannot assure that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our services  or design around any intellectual property rights we hold 
see the discussion under item legal proceedings for further information regarding infringement of our patent 
from time to time we may receive notice of claims of infringement of other parties intellectual property rights 
as the number of services in our market increases and functionalities overlap  companies such as ours may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
any infringement claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  diversion of technical and management personnel  or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements 
such licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
operations our operations department is responsible for the management and support of our global data centers and technology infrastructure hours a day  days a week  days a year 
we support and manage the transaction services business with enterprise class technologies and tools 
these technologies and tools are deployed and managed by strict adherence to proven operational principles  processes  and procedures 
we believe this technology  the processes  and our employees enable us to deliver the highest level of services and performance to our customers 
as of december   we employed persons in our operations department

sales and marketing cybersource maintains distinct sales and marketing organizations for our enterprise and small businesses 
we currently have active partnership relationships with approximately  resellers 
enterprise sales and marketing targets prospective customers worldwide through a direct sales force as well as through resellers  managed commerce providers  and referral partners 
small business sales and marketing targets prospective small business customers domestically through resellers  affiliates  and inside sales 
resellers we have contractual relationships with our resellers that allow them to offer and bundle the cybersource suite of services in conjunction with their solution offering and facilitate the sale and billing of our services 
resellers are authorized to sell our hosted services and support services 
our resellers include banks and payment service providers  such as bank of america  chase paymentech  first data merchant services  independent sales organizations isos  as well as a number of smaller partners 
affiliate resellers for authorize 
net are individuals and businesses who have merchant customers  but are not able to provide those merchant customers with payment services 
the affiliate refers the merchant to authorize 
net and we then handle the setup  billing and ongoing support for their payment gateway 
affiliates receive a commission for each referral sale that we close  as well as a portion of the monthly fees and transaction fees generated by each of the merchants 
managed commerce providers mcps and affiliate partners managed commerce providers typically host customized and turnkey storefronts for online businesses 
mcps and affiliate partners manage the entire customer relationship including operations  support  and billing 
mcps and affiliate partners include internet service providers  application service providers  and specialized systems integrators 
mcp partners include the acquity group llc  channeladvisor corporation  escalate retail inc  pfs web and uniteu technologies 
referral partners these are companies with which we have referral agreements  structured with or without monetary incentives 
these allies include companies from the payment industry  independent software vendors  integrators and consulting firms  such as demandware  marketlive  and netsuite 
in addition to channel and referral relationships  we pursue both solutions alliances and strategic alliances 
these result in cooperative product development efforts  streamlining of integration capabilities and leveraged marketing efforts 
these solution alliances integrate cybersource technology into some of their products  making it easier for their customers to access cybersource products and services and include companies such as oracle includes peoplesoft and siebel  and atg 
strategic alliances our strategic alliances include our relationships with bill me later  paypal  and visa usa we work with strategic alliances to enhance our existing solutions portfolio  develop new services and drive the adoption of industry standards 
as of december   we employed a total of employees in sales and marketing and an additional professional service consultants 
competition the market for our products and services is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
we face competition from merchant acquirers  independent sales organizations  and payment processors such as chase paymentech  first data corporation  and royal bank of scotland 
we also face competition from transaction service providers such as paypal  retail decisions  and st parameter  as well as ecommerce providers such as digital river and gsi commerce inc furthermore  other companies  including financial services and credit companies may enter the market and provide competing services 
another source of competition comes from businesses that develop their own internal  custom made systems 
such businesses typically make large initial investments to develop custom made systems and therefore  may be less likely to adopt outside services or vendor developed online commerce transaction processing software 
we compete on the basis of certain factors  including system and product reliability  product performance  features and functionality  outsourced management  domain expertise  sales channels  operating environments and applications supported  ease of implementation and integration  time to market  customer support  and  price 
presently  we believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
however  the market for our solutions is rapidly evolving and we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
we expect that competitive pressures may result in the reduction of our prices or our market share or both  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
employees as of december   we had a total of full time employees  including employees in professional services  sales  and marketing  employees in product development  employees in operations and customer support  and employees in general and administrative services 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider employee relations to be good 
international sales products and services provided to merchants outside the united states accounted for   and of our revenues in   and  respectively 
regulations the following regulations may adversely affect our business now or in the future fair credit reporting act 
because our fraud screening system assesses the probability of fraud in an online credit card transaction  we may be deemed a consumer reporting agency under the fair credit reporting act 
as a precaution  we have implemented processes that we believe will enable us to comply with the act if we were deemed a consumer reporting agency 
complying with the act requires us to provide information about personal data stored by us 
failure to comply with the act could result in claims being made against us by individual consumers and the federal trade commission 
export control regulations 
current export control regulations prohibit the export of strong encryption technology without a license unless exempt from license requirements  thereby preventing us from using stronger encryption technology to protect the security of data being transmitted to and from internet merchants outside of the united states 
we have obtained a license to use bit encryption technology with our international merchants 
furthermore  we believe that our products and services fall under certain licensing exemptions as financial products 
item a risk factors 
set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including in item  management s discussion and analysis  and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described herein the expected fluctuations of our quarterly results could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline we expect that our quarterly operating results will fluctuate significantly in the future based upon a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated market growth and our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our revenues are lower than we expect  our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  including the following changes in the size and number of transactions processed on behalf of customers as a result of seasonality  success of each customer s business  general economic conditions or regulatory requirements restricting our customers  our ability to attract new customers and to retain our existing customers  customer acceptance of new products and services we may offer  including our global acquiring business  the success of our integration of authorize 
net  customer acceptance of our pricing model  customer acceptance of our software and our professional services offerings  the success of our sales and marketing programs  an interruption with one or more of our processors  other financial institutions and technology service providers  seasonality of the retail sector  changes in accounting rules and regulations  war or other international conflicts  and weakness in the general us economy and the lack of available capital for our customers and potential future customers 
other factors that may affect our quarterly results are set forth elsewhere in this section 
as a result of these factors  our revenues are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
due to the uncertainty surrounding our revenues and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our historical operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to adequately integrate acquired businesses as part of our future business strategy  we may pursue strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies that would provide additional product or service offerings  additional industry expertise  a broader client base or an expanded geographic presence 
for example  on november   we completed the acquisition of authorize 
net 
if we do not successfully integrate a strategic acquisition  or if the benefits of the transaction do not meet the expectations of financial or industry analysts  the market price of our common stock may decline 
any future acquisition could result in the use of significant amounts of cash  dilutive issuances of equity securities  or the incurrence of debt or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired company  risks of entering markets in which we have either no or limited prior experiences  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and the potential loss of key employees of an acquired company 
the size and scope of the authorize 
net acquisition increases both the scope and consequence of these ongoing integration risks 
even if the acquisition is successfully integrated  we may not receive all of the expected benefits of the transaction 
we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the authorize 
net merger  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock after the merger the authorize 
net merger involves the integration of two former companies that have previously operated independently 
we anticipate that the merger will create opportunities to achieve cost savings and revenue synergies  to share technological developments and to achieve other synergistic benefits 
the success of the authorize 
net merger will depend  in part  on our ability to achieve the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits from combining the businesses of the two former companies 
we expect the combined company to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies  as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale and market integration 
however  to realize these anticipated benefits  we must successfully combine the businesses of the two former companies 
if we are not able to achieve these objectives  the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 
we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction in the amounts and times projected for a number of reasons  including that the integration may take longer than anticipated  be more costly than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results relating to the two former companies existing businesses 
potential customer  merchant and employee uncertainty related to the authorize 
net merger could harm the combined company the potential customers of the combined company may  in response to the authorize 
net merger  determine not to purchase services from us 
any such determinations not to purchase by our customers could seriously harm our business 
similarly  our employees may experience uncertainty about their future role following the combination 
this may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management  marketing  sales  customer support and technical personnel  which could harm us 
furthermore  certain former authorize 
net resellers may deem us to be a competitor because we offer merchant acquiring services that may overlap with services offered by certain resellers 
if we are not successful in integrating the authorize 
net business and organization  the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized achieving the anticipated benefits of the authorize 
net merger will depend  in part  on the integration of technology  operations and personnel of the two former companies 
we cannot assure you that the integration will be successful or that the anticipated benefits of the merger will be fully realized 
the challenges involved in this integration include the following persuading the employees that the two former companies business cultures are compatible and retaining the combined company s key personnel  maintaining the dedication of management resources to integration activities without diverting attention from the day to day business of the combined company  maintaining management s ability to focus on anticipating  responding to or utilizing changing technologies in the electronic payment industry  maintaining former authorize 
net s key reseller relationships  demonstrating to customers that the merger has not resulted in adverse changes to the ability of the combined company to address the needs of customers of the loss of attention or business focus  integrating the utah and washington offices of authorize 
net into our corporate structure  keeping existing independent sales organization channels intact  and keeping and retaining key former authorize 
net employees 
it is not certain that the two companies can be successfully integrated in a timely manner or at all or that any of the anticipated benefits will be realized 
in addition  we cannot assure you that there will not be substantial unanticipated costs associated with the integration process  that integration activities will not result in a decrease in revenues  a decrease in the value of our common stock  or that there will not be other material adverse effects from our integration efforts 
if we are unable to successfully integrate authorize 
net  or if the benefits of the merger do not meet the expectations of financial or industry analysts  the market price of our common stock may decline 
loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company our success will depend in part upon our ability to retain key employees of both legacy cybersource and legacy authorize 
net 
competition for qualified personnel can be very intense 
in addition  key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty or difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key employees 
loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we face uncertainties related to the effectiveness of internal controls public companies in the united states are required to review their internal controls over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of it should be noted that any system of controls  however well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  and not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the system are met 
in addition  the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events 
because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems  there can be no assurance that any design will achieve its stated goal under all potential future conditions  regardless of how remote 
although our management has determined that our internal controls were effective as of the end of our most recent fiscal year  there can be no assurance that the integration of authorize 
net and its internal control systems and procedures  will not result in or lead to a future material weakness in our internal controls  or that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future 
a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting would require management and the company s independent public accounting firm to evaluate our internal controls as ineffective 
if internal controls over financial reporting are not considered adequate  we may experience a loss of public confidence  which could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 
failure to manage future growth effectively may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the event that we experience rapid growth in our operations  a significant strain may be placed upon management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
our success will depend in part upon the ability of our executive officers to manage growth effectively 
our ability to grow also depends upon our ability to successfully hire  train  supervise  and manage new employees  obtain financing for our capital needs  expand our systems effectively  allocate our human resources optimally  maintain clear lines of communication between our transactional and management functions and our finance and accounting functions  and manage the pressures on our management and administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately anticipate and respond to the changing demands we will face as we integrate and continue to expand our operations  and we may not be able to manage growth effectively or to achieve growth at all 
any failure to manage the future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting might adversely affect the market value of our common stock in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the authorize 
net merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  which will result in charges to earnings that could have an adverse impact on the market value of our common stock 
under the purchase method of accounting  the total estimated purchase price was allocated to authorize 
net s net tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets or expense for research and development based on their fair values as of november  any excess of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill 
we will incur additional amortization expense based on the identifiable amortizable intangible assets acquired pursuant to the merger agreement and their relative useful lives 
additionally  to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets or other long lived assets may become impaired  we will be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment 
these amortization and potential impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we currently estimate that we will initially incur approximately million of incremental annual amortization expense 
changes in earnings per share  including as a result of this incremental expense  could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our stock price may fluctuate substantially due to factors outside our control the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors outside our control  including the following the announcement of new products  services or enhancements by our competitors  quarterly variations in our competitors results of operations  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  developments in our industry  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
these factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the intense competition in our industry could reduce or eliminate the demand for our products and services the market for our products and services is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
we face competition from merchant acquirers  independent sales organizations  and payment processors such as chase paymentech solutions  first data corporation  ipayment inc  and royal bank of scotland 
we also face competition from transaction service providers such as paypal and retail decisions as well as ecommerce providers such as bertelsmann financial services  digital river  and gsi commerce inc further  other companies  including financial services and credit companies may enter the market and provide competing services 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products and services on terms favorable to us 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products and services obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other solution providers  thereby increasing their ability to address the needs of our existing or prospective customers 
our current and potential competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future channel partners  thereby limiting our ability to sell products and services through these channels 
we expect that competitive pressures may result in the reduction of our prices or our market share or both  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
potential system failures and lack of capacity issues could negatively affect demand for our services our ability to deliver services to our merchants depends on the uninterrupted operation of our commerce transaction processing systems 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from denial of service attacks  computer viruses  war  earthquake  fire  flood and other manmade or natural disasters  and power loss  telecommunications or data network failure  operator negligence  improper operation by employees  physical and electronic break ins and similar events 
despite the fact that we have implemented redundant servers in third party hosting centers located in san jose california  seattle washington  denver colorado  phoenix arizona  london england and tokyo japan  we may still experience service interruptions for the reasons listed above and a variety of other reasons 
if our redundant servers are not available  we may not have sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for resulting losses 
we have experienced periodic interruptions  affecting all or a portion of our systems  which we believe will continue to occur from time to time 
for example  on november   our services were unavailable for approximately ten hours due to an internal system problem 
we have also subsequently experienced service interruptions and performance issues 
any interruption in our systems that impairs our ability to efficiently and timely provide services could damage our reputation and reduce demand for our services 
our success also depends on our ability to grow  or scale  our commerce transaction systems to accommodate increases in the volume of traffic on our systems  especially during peak periods of demand 
we may not be able to anticipate increases in the use of our systems or successfully expand the capacity of our network infrastructure 
our inability to expand our systems to handle increased traffic could result in system disruptions  slower response times and other difficulties in providing services to our merchant customers  which could materially harm our business 
a breach of our ecommerce security measures could reduce demand for our services a requirement of the continued growth of e commerce is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
we rely on public key cryptography  an encryption method that utilizes two keys  a public and a private key  for encoding and decoding data  and digital certificate technology  or identity verification  to provide the security and authentication necessary for secure transmission of confidential information 
regulatory and export restrictions may prohibit us from using the most secure cryptographic protection available and thereby expose us to an increased risk of data interception 
a party who is able to circumvent security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or interrupt our operations 
any compromise or elimination of security could reduce demand for our services 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and to address any problems they may cause 
concerns over the security of the internet and other online transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet and other online services generally  and the web in particular  especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
because our activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our security measures may not prevent security breaches  and failure to prevent security breaches may disrupt our operations 
we could incur chargeback or merchant fraud losses we have potential liability for certain transactions processed through our global acquiring services if the payments associated with such transactions are rejected  refused  or returned for reasons such as consumer fraud or billing disputes 
for instance  if a billing dispute between a merchant and payer is not ultimately resolved in favor of the merchant  the disputed transaction may be charged back to the merchant s bank and credited to the payer s account 
if the charged back amount cannot be recovered from the merchant s account  or if the merchant refuses or is financially unable to reimburse its bank for the charged back amount  we may bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the payer s bank 
we could also incur fraud losses as a result of merchant fraud 
merchant fraud occurs when a merchant  rather than a customer  intentionally uses a stolen or counterfeit card  card number  or other bank account number to process a false sales transaction  or knowingly fails to deliver merchandise or services in an otherwise valid transaction 
we may be responsible for any losses for certain transactions if we are unable to collect from the merchant 
we have established systems and procedures designed to detect and reduce the impact of consumer fraud and merchant fraud  but we cannot assure you that these measures are or will be effective 
to date  we have not incurred any significant losses relating to charged back transactions 
during  our global acquiring revenue represented approximately of our total revenue 
our global acquiring revenue may also include fees generated for gateway services as it is becoming more common to charge the customer a bundled price for transaction services provided 
to the extent our global acquiring revenue grows  our potential liability for such chargebacks or merchant fraud increases 
our revenue and customer relationships could be impacted if we were to lose bank sponsorship the card associations require a bank sponsor that ultimately assumes chargeback or merchant fraud losses if we were financially unable to assume such losses 
if our current bank sponsor were to terminate our agreement  we would be unable to provide global acquiring services  which could impact our future revenue and customer relationships 
if we are not able to fully utilize relationships with our sales alliances  we may experience lower revenue growth and higher operating costs our future growth will depend in part on the success of our relationships with existing and future sales alliances that market our products and services to their merchant accounts 
if these relationships are not successful or do not develop as quickly as we anticipate  our revenue growth may be adversely affected 
accordingly  we may have to increase our sales and marketing expenses in an attempt to secure additional merchant accounts 
our market is subject to rapid technological change and to compete we must continually enhance our systems to comply with evolving standards to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and features of our products and services and the underlying network infrastructure 
the internet and the e commerce industries are characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies  and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our technology and systems obsolete 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to both internally develop and license leading technologies to enhance our existing products and services and develop new products and services 
we must continue to address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our merchants  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
the development of proprietary technology involves significant technical and business risks 
we may fail to develop new technologies effectively or to adapt our proprietary technology and systems to merchant requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions  merchant requirements or emerging industry standards  our business would be materially harmed 
the demand for our products and services could be negatively affected by a reduced growth of e commerce or delays in the development of the internet infrastructure sales of goods and services over the internet do not currently represent a significant portion of overall sales of goods and services 
we depend on the growing use and acceptance of the internet as an effective medium of commerce by merchants and customers in the united states and internationally 
the sale of goods and services over the internet has gained acceptance more slowly outside of the united states 
we cannot be certain that acceptance and use of the internet will continue to develop or that a sufficiently broad base of merchants and consumers will adopt  and continue to use  the internet as a medium of commerce 
the increase in the significance of the internet as a commercial marketplace may occur more slowly than anticipated for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies and performance improvements 
if the number of internet users  or the use of internet resources by existing users  continues to grow  it may overwhelm the existing internet infrastructure 
delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity could also have a detrimental effect 
these factors could result in slower response times or adversely affect usage of the internet  resulting in lower numbers of commerce transactions and lower demand for our products and services 
our international business exposes us to additional foreign risks products and services provided to merchants outside the united states accounted for   and of our revenues in   and  respectively 
in march  we entered into a joint venture agreement with japanese partners marubeni corporation and trans cosmos  inc and established cybersource kk to provide commerce transaction services to the japanese market 
conducting business outside of the united states is subject to additional risks that may affect our ability to sell our products and services and result in reduced revenues  including changes in regulatory requirements  reduced protection of intellectual property rights  evolving privacy laws in europe  the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and war  political or economic instability or constraints on international trade 
in addition  some software contains encryption technology that renders it subject to export restrictions and we may become liable to the extent we violate these restrictions 
we might not successfully market  sell or distribute our products and services in local markets and we cannot be certain that one or more of these factors will not materially adversely affect our future international operations  and consequently  our business  financial condition and operating results 
also  sales of our products and services conducted through our subsidiary in the united kingdom are primarily denominated in pounds sterling 
we may experience fluctuations in revenues or operating expenses due to fluctuations in the value of the pounds sterling relative to the us dollar 
we do not currently enter into transactions with the specific purpose to hedge against currency exchange fluctuations 
changes in accounting standards regarding stock option plans will reduce our profitability and could limit the desirability of granting stock options  which could harm our ability to attract and retain employees we have included employee stock based compensation costs in our results of operations for the years ended december  and  as discussed in note in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
the full impact is dependent upon  among other things  the outcome of our current assessment of different long term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees  the total number of stock awards granted and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock based expenses 
in addition  new regulations implemented by the nasdaq stock market requiring stockholder approval for all stock option plans could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant stock options to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we lose key personnel  we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our key management personnel  including william s 
mckiernan  our chief executive officer  and other key members of management because of their experience and knowledge regarding the development  special opportunities and challenges of our business 
none of our current key employees are subject to an employment contract which enables us to retain them for a specific period of time 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key employees in the future 
we may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology and may be infringing upon third party intellectual property rights our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  contractors  vendors and potential customers and alliances 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
we cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products and services or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
we also cannot assure you that third parties will not claim that the technology employed in providing our current or future products and services infringe upon their rights 
we have not conducted any search to determine whether any of our products and services or technologies may be infringing upon patent rights of third parties 
as the number of products and services in our market increases and functionalities increasingly overlap  companies such as ours may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
in addition  these claims also might require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
any infringement claims  with or without merit  could absorb significant management time and lead to costly litigation 
if required to do so  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements  or obtain them on terms acceptable to us 
we may become subject to government regulation and legal uncertainties that would adversely affect our financial results we are not currently subject to direct regulation by any domestic or foreign governmental agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally  export control laws and laws or regulations directly applicable to e commerce 
however  due to the increasing usage of the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be applicable or may be adopted in the future with respect to conducting business over the internet covering issues such as taxes  user privacy  pricing  content  right to access personal data  copyrights  distribution  and characteristics and quality of products and services 
for example  we believe that our fraud screen service may require us to comply with the fair credit reporting act the act 
as a precaution  we have implemented processes that we believe will enable us to comply with the act if we were deemed a consumer reporting agency 
complying with the act requires us to provide information about personal data stored by us 
failure to comply with the act could result in claims being made against us by individual consumers and the federal trade commission 
furthermore  the growth and development of the market for e commerce may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business online 
the adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet or other online services  which could  in turn  decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 
the applicability of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights  encryption and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel  export or import matters and personal privacy to the internet is uncertain 
the vast majority of laws were adopted prior to the broad commercial use of the internet and related technologies 
as a result  they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes to these laws intended to address these issues  including some recently proposed changes in the united states regarding taxation and encryption and in the european union regarding contract formation and privacy  could create uncertainty in the internet marketplace and impose additional costs and other burdens 
these uncertainties  costs and burdens could reduce demand for our products and services or increase the cost of doing business due to increased litigation costs or increased service delivery costs 
the anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation may make a change in control more difficult to finalize  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
these provisions may allow our board of directors to prevent changes in our management and controlling interests 
under delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures in the future 
one anti takeover provision that we have is the ability of our board of directors to determine the terms of preferred stock and issue preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock 
our certificate of incorporation allows the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
as of december   there are no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
however  because the rights and preferences of any series of preferred stock may be set by our board of directors in its sole discretion without approval of the holders of the common stock  the rights and preferences of this preferred stock may be superior to those of the common stock 
accordingly  the rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected 
our fraud detection services and marketing agreement with visa usa can be terminated in july  we entered into an agreement with visa usa to jointly develop and promote the cybersource advanced fraud screen service enhanced by visa for use in the united states 
under the terms of the agreement  visa agreed to promote and market the new product to its member financial institutions and internet merchants 
the agreement expires in july  but can be terminated by either party with ninety days prior written notice 
thereafter  the agreement renews automatically for additional periods of one year  unless terminated by either party

also as a result of the acquisition of authorize

the broomfield  colorado facility has been subleased for the balance of the lease term 
item legal proceedings in july and august  various class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court  southern district of new york  against us  our chairman and ceo  a former officer  and four brokerage firms that served as underwriters in our initial public offering 
the actions were filed on behalf of persons who purchased our stock issued pursuant to or traceable to the initial public offering during the period from june  through december  the action alleges that our underwriters charged secret excessive commissions to certain of their customers in return for allocations of our stock in the offering 
the two individual defendants are alleged to be liable because of their involvement in preparing and signing the registration statement for the offering  which allegedly failed to disclose the supposedly excessive commissions 
on december   an amended complaint was filed in one of the actions to expand the purported class to persons who purchased our stock issued pursuant to or traceable to the follow on public offering during the period from november  through december  the lawsuit filed against us is one of several hundred lawsuits filed against other companies based on substantially similar claims 
on april   a consolidated amended complaint was filed to consolidate all of the complaints and claims into one case 
the consolidated amended complaint alleges claims that are virtually identical to the amended complaint filed on december  and the original complaints 
in october  the claims against our officer and a former officer that were named in the amended complaint were dismissed without prejudice 
in july  we  along with other issuer defendants in the case  filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint with prejudice 
on february   the court issued a written decision denying the motion to dismiss with respect to cybersource and the individual defendants 
on july   a committee of our board of directors approved a proposed partial settlement with the plaintiffs in this matter 
the settlement would have provided  among other things  a release of cybersource and of the individual defendants for the alleged wrongful conduct in the amended complaint in exchange for a guarantee from our insurers regarding recovery from the underwriter defendants and other consideration from us regarding our underwriters 
the plaintiffs have continued to litigate against the underwriter defendants 
the district court directed that the litigation proceed within a number of focus cases rather than in all of the cases that have been consolidated 
our case is not one of these focus cases 
on october   the district court certified the focus cases as class actions 
the underwriter defendants appealed that ruling  and on december   the court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the district court s class certification decision 
on april   the second circuit denied plaintiffs petition for rehearing 
in light of the second circuit opinion  we have informed the district court that this settlement cannot be approved because the defined settlement class  like the litigation class  cannot be certified 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to renegotiate a settlement that complies with the second circuit s mandate 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the matter 
however  any direct financial impact of the proposed settlement is expected to be borne by our insurers 
on august   we filed suit in the northern district of california against retail decisions  inc red us and retail decisions plc red uk collectively  red  case no 
civ  alleging that red infringes our us patent no 
 the patent 
we served red us with the complaint on august   and we served red uk with the complaint on august  on september   red responded to our complaint 
red filed a motion to stay the case for days pending a determination by the us patent and trademark office pto as to whether it will grant red s request that the pto re examine the patent 
red also filed a motion for a more definite statement by us with respect to our allegation that red is willfully infringing the patent 
in addition  red uk filed a motion to dismiss the action against it on the ground that it is not subject to personal jurisdiction in the northern district of california 
on october   red filed a request for re examination with the pto  based on prior art red discovered that allegedly invalidates the patent 
on october   we filed an opposition to red s motion to stay the case for days and an opposition to red s motion for a more definite statement with respect to willful infringement 
based on red uk s representation that red us is the sole entity that develops  operates  and distributes the ebitguard service  we agreed to dismiss red uk while reserving the right to reinstitute action against red uk in the event we later discover that red uk is subject to the court s personal jurisdiction 
in return  red uk agreed that if we later establish that personal jurisdiction existed  we could re file against red uk in this action without prejudice to our damages claim 
we also filed an amended complaint  removing red uk as a named defendant and restating the willful infringement claim 
on november   the court granted red s motion to stay the proceedings pending the pto s decision as to whether it will grant red s request for re examination 
on december   the pto granted red s request for a re examination 
on january   red filed a motion to dismiss the case without prejudice or to extend the stay until completion of the re examination process 
on january   the court extended the stay pending the re examination process  vacated red s motion to dismiss  and ordered quarterly updates as to the status of the re examination process 
on april   the parties filed a joint status report that was approved by the court 
on june   the pto issued a preliminary office action rejecting all of the claims of the patent based on one of the prior art references cited by red 
on july   we met with the pto examiner handling the re examination to distinguish the prior art from the claims of the patent 
on august   the pto issued a final office action rejecting all of the claims of the patent 
on september   we filed a response to the office action requesting certain amendments to the claims 
on october   the pto filed a response rejecting the amendments and extending our deadline to file a notice of appeal 
on october   we filed a notice of appeal 
on december   we filed the appeal brief 
on may   the pto issued a notice of intent to issue reexam certificate  reversing its action of august  accordingly  the patent has been re validated and we expect to receive a new patent certificate shortly 
while there can be no assurances as to the outcome of the lawsuit  we do not presently believe that the lawsuit would have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we are currently party to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not believe that the outcome of any of these claims or any of the above mentioned legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders we held a special meeting of stockholders on october  in connection with our acquisition of authorize 
net 
the stockholders voted on proposals to issue cybersource common stock in connection with the mergers contemplated by the agreement and plan of reorganization  dated june   by and among the company  authorize 
net holdings  inc  congress acquisition sub  inc  and congress acquisition sub llc 
amend the cybersource amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock  par value  from million to million

our risk and compliance management tools address complexities common to online merchants such as credit card fraud  online tax requirements and export controls 
our reporting and management tools facilitate the automation of the flow of complex ecommerce processes  such as recurring billing and payment reconciliation 
we partner with and connect to a large network of payment processors and other payment service providers to offer merchants a single source solution

transaction and global acquiring revenues are recognized in the period in which the transactions occur and support service fees are recognized as the related services are provided and costs are incurred 
authorize 
net acquisition on november   we completed the acquisition of authorize 
net holdings  inc authorize 
net  a provider of products and services primarily for businesses that sell products and services online 
we believe that cybersource and authorize 
net s respective businesses complement each other and the acquisition will increase the scale and scope of the combined company  diversify the combined company s service offerings  and create opportunities for cost reductions through integration savings 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  the total purchase price of million was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired is determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management 
the consolidated statement of income includes revenues and expenses of authorize 
net for the period from november   the date of acquisition  to december   including approximately million of amortization expense related to the authorize 
net intangible assets 
see note of our consolidated financial statements 
bidpay 
com closure in december of  we announced the closure of bidpay 
com  inc bidpay 
as a result  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgments regarding the collectibility of fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we derive a significant portion of our transaction processing revenues from global acquiring fees charged to merchants for payment processing services 
our fees  which are primarily a percentage of the dollar amount of each transaction processed  are based upon the merchant s monthly charge volume and risk profile 
in addition  we record revenues for miscellaneous services related to global acquiring  such as fees for processing credit card chargebacks 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf  we recognize these fees on a gross basis as we are the primary agent in the transaction in the period the merchants transactions are processed 
related interchange fees paid to card issuing banks and assessments paid to credit card associations are recognized in cost of revenues at that time 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments as well as for potential sales returns 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
these estimates are based on historical bad debt experience and other known factors 
if the historical data we used to determine these estimates does not properly reflect future losses  additional allowances may be required 
reserve for merchant losses we have potential liability for certain transactions processed through our global acquiring services if the payments associated with such transactions are rejected  refused  or returned for reasons such as consumer fraud or billing disputes 
for instance  if a billing dispute between a merchant and payer is not ultimately resolved in favor of the merchant  the disputed transaction may be charged back to the merchant s bank and credited to the payer s account 
if the charged back amount cannot be recovered from the merchant s account  or if the merchant refuses or is financially unable to reimburse its bank for the charged back amount  we may bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the payer s bank 
we could also incur fraud losses as a result of merchant fraud 
merchant fraud occurs when a merchant  rather than a customer  intentionally uses a stolen or counterfeit card  card number  or other bank account number to process a false sales transaction  or knowingly fails to deliver merchandise or services in an otherwise valid transaction 
we may be responsible for any losses for certain transactions if we are unable to collect from the merchant 
we evaluate the merchant s risk for potential losses based on historical experience and other relevant factors and record a loss reserve accordingly 
if the data we use to determine potential losses does not properly reflect future losses  additional reserves may be required 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these proceedings as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accruals required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  as of december   we do not believe our current proceedings will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or as a result of the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an income tax benefit of million 
this benefit included a million reduction in the valuation allowance related to a portion of our deferred tax assets that will more likely than not be realized 
this determination was primarily based on one year of projected taxable income 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an income tax benefit of million 
this benefit included a million reduction in the valuation allowance related to a portion of our deferred tax assets that will more likely than not be realized  based on three years of future projected taxable income 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an income tax benefit of million 
this benefit included a million reduction in the valuation allowance related to a portion of our deferred tax assets that will more likely than not be realized  based on three years of future projected taxable income 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition of authorize 
net  we recorded as an adjustment to goodwill a million reduction in the valuation allowance related to a portion of our deferred tax assets that will more likely than not be realized 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions to forecast federal  state  and international operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment regarding the forecasts of future taxable income  and are consistent with the forecasts used to manage our business 
we intend to maintain the remaining valuation allowance until sufficient further positive evidence exists to support further reversals of the valuation allowance 
our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which the company adopted as of january  the company s first fiscal quarter of  using the modified prospective method 
total stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  and was and million  respectively  before income taxes 
as of december   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non vested stock options was approximately million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we used the black scholes option valuation model to estimate stock based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and we will recognize the expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 
long lived assets statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that we perform tests for impairment of our goodwill annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
as of december   we had recorded goodwill in connection with our acquisition of authorize 
net with a carrying value of approximately million 
significant judgments could be required to evaluate goodwill for impairment in the future including the determination of reporting units  estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
we will evaluate the goodwill related to the authorize 
net acquisition on an annual basis as of july statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas requires that we perform tests for impairment of our intangible assets subject to amortization annually and more frequently whenever events or circumstances suggest that our intangible assets may be impaired 
as of december   we had recorded intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of authorize 
net  with a carrying value of approximately million  consisting of partner contracts and related relationships  merchant contracts and related relationships  existing technology  trade name and processor relationships 
the value of the partner contracts and related relationships as well as the merchant contracts and related relationships were derived by considering  among other factors  the expected income and discounted cash flows to be generated from such contracts and relationships 
the value of the existing technology was derived by considering  among other factors  the expected income and discounted cash flows to be generated  taking into account risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology and assessments of the life cycle state of the technology 
the value of the trade name was derived by considering  among other factors  expected income and discounted cash flows to be generated  also taking into account the expected period in which the company intends to utilize the trade name 
the value of the processor relationships was derived by considering the expected cost that would be incurred to establish and build connections with the processors 
to evaluate potential impairment  sfas and sfas require us to assess whether the estimated fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets are greater than their carrying value at the time of the test 
accordingly  there could be significant judgment in determining the fair values attributable to our goodwill and intangible assets  including the determination of reporting units  estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
as we are required to periodically evaluate our goodwill and intangible asset balances for impairment  if we incur impairments to our intangible assets  it would have an adverse impact on our future earnings

recent pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in december  the fasb released a proposed fasb staff position fsp fas b effective date of fasb statement no 
which  if adopted as proposed  would delay the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we are currently assessing the impact that sfas may have on our results of operations and financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the company has elected not to adopt sfas in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  including goodwill  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the impact of adopting sfas r will be dependent on the future business combinations that we may pursue after its effective date 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we provide our services to customers primarily in the united states and  to a lesser extent  in europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
all sales are currently denominated in us dollars or pound sterling 
a strengthening of the us dollar or the pound sterling could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
due to the nature of our cash equivalents and short term investments  which are primarily money market funds  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure
