for capital  a benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the average yield on the total investment portfolio 
the benchmark investment yields are applied to each segment s investable funds and capital  respectively  to produce a total notional investment income by segment 
the company s actual net investment income is allocated to each segment in proportion to the respective segment s notional investment income to total notional investment income

in the first quarter of  the company discontinued the use of contingent commissions and implemented a new fixed agent compensation program for all of its personal insurance business 
the company also offered the majority of its agents conducting commercial insurance business the option to switch to this new program 
the company s total payout rate for all agent compensation for was substantially the same as for  however  the change to the new program created a difference in the timing of commission expense recognition 
the cost of the new program is required to be deferred and amortized over the related policy period generally six to twelve months  whereas the cost of the contingent commission program was not subject to deferred acquisition cost accounting treatment and  therefore  was expensed as incurred 
that timing difference resulted in a benefit to income during the transition year 
the impact of this change in was to lower reported expenses by million in the general and administrative expenses income statement line  and increase reported expenses by million in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs income statement line  compared to what would have been reported under the prior contingent commission program 
general and administrative expenses totaled billion in  an increase of million  or  over the comparable total of billion

in  earned premiums of billion decreased by million  or  compared with  as premium increases in the majority of the segment s ongoing operations were more than offset by the continuing decline in other runoff operations earned premiums  including the impact of the sale of the personal catastrophe risk operation in november the personal catastrophe risk operation accounted for million of earned premiums in earned premiums in were reduced by million of reinstatement premiums related to catastrophe losses 
net investment income refer to the net investment income section of the consolidated results of operations discussion herein for a description of the factors contributing to the increase in the company s net investment income in and fee income national accounts is the primary source of fee income due to its service businesses  which include claim and loss prevention services to large companies that choose to self insure a portion of their insurance risks  and claims and policy management services to workers compensation residual market pools

the commercial multi peril and general liability product lines experienced better than anticipated loss development that was attributable to several factors  including improved legal and judicial environments  as well as enhanced risk control  underwriting and claim process initiatives 
the commercial automobile product line experienced better than expected loss development due to more favorable legal and judicial environments  claim handling initiatives focused on the automobile line of insurance and improvements in auto safety technology 
the property product line experienced fewer than expected late reported claims related to non catastrophe weather events that occurred late in  as well as better than expected frequency and severity due in part to changes in the marketplace  such as higher deductibles and lower policy limits 
in addition  the property product line experienced better than expected large loss outcomes which were partially attributable to favorable litigation resolutions

the company s completion of its annual in depth asbestos claim review in the third quarter of and its quarterly asbestos reserve reviews throughout the year resulted in no change to the company s asbestos reserves in refer to the asbestos claims and litigation and environmental claims and litigation sections herein for additional discussion 
in  net favorable prior year reserve development in the commercial multi peril  general liability  property and commercial automobile lines of business was largely offset by increases totaling million to asbestos and environmental reserves and reserve strengthening for assumed reinsurance business in runoff 
the commercial multi peril and liability lines of business experienced better than anticipated loss development in that was attributable to several factors  including improving legal and judicial environments  as well as enhanced risk control  underwriting and claim process initiatives 
the favorable prior year reserve development in in the property line of business primarily reflected less demand surge inflation than originally estimated for accident year non catastrophe and catastrophe losses 
demand surge refers to significant short term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services 
the commercial automobile line of business experienced better than expected loss development which was attributable to more favorable legal and judicial environments  claim handling initiatives focused on the automobile line of insurance and improvements in auto safety technology 
the reserve strengthening in assumed reinsurance was primarily due to changes in projected loss development driven by an unanticipated change in the claim settlement patterns of the underlying casualty exposures 
claims and claim adjustment expenses of billion in were billion lower than the total of billion  primarily due to a significant decline in catastrophe losses and net favorable prior year reserve development in compared with net unfavorable prior year reserve development in no catastrophe losses were incurred in  whereas included catastrophe losses of billion  nearly all of which resulted from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
net favorable prior year reserve development totaled million in  the components of which are described above 
in  net unfavorable prior year reserve development of million was driven by an increase to asbestos reserves of million and reserve strengthening for environmental claims and runoff assumed reinsurance business 
those increases were partially offset by favorable prior year reserve development from lower frequency and severity for both casualty and property related lines of business  which were driven by increasingly favorable legal and judicial environments  coupled with better than expected results from changes in policy provisions as well as underwriting and pricing criteria 
company initiatives relating to claims handling  which affected claims staffing and workflows  also are believed to have contributed to the emergence of favorable severity experience in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled billion in  higher than the comparable total of billion 
the increase reflected the growth in business volume  as well as a million increase from the implementation of the new fixed agent compensation program described in more detail in the consolidated overview section herein 
in  the amortization of deferred amortization costs of billion was slightly lower than the total of billion 
general and administrative expenses in totaled billion  lower than the comparable total of billion in the implementation of the new fixed agent compensation program in the first quarter of resulted in a reduction of million in reported general and administrative expenses in compared to what would have been reported under the prior contingent commission program during those periods

the total included a provision for legal expenses related to investigations of various business practices by certain governmental agencies 
general and administrative expenses in totaled billion  higher than the comparable total of billion in the increase in primarily reflected the segment s expenditures to support business growth and product development  the segment s share of costs associated with the company s national advertising campaign and the legal expenses described above 
gaap combined ratio the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of in was points lower than the comparable ratio of 
in  net favorable prior year reserve development provided a point benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio  whereas the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio included a point benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development 
adjusting for the impact of prior year reserve development in both years  the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in was points better than the comparable ratio  reflecting continued favorable current accident year results 
the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in improved by points compared with the ratio of  primarily due to the absence of catastrophe losses and net favorable prior year reserve development in  compared with net unfavorable prior year reserve development in catastrophe losses accounted for points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 
net favorable prior year reserve development in provided a point benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio  whereas net unfavorable prior year reserve development in accounted for points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 
excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development  the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio improved points over the comparable ratio  reflecting improvement in frequency and severity trends in several lines of business in the underwriting expense ratio of in  which included a point benefit resulting from the implementation of the new fixed agent compensation program  was points higher than the ratio  reflecting the increases in general and administrative expenses described above  and the impact of a decline in fee income 
a portion of fee income is accounted for as a reduction of expenses for purposes of calculating the expense ratio 
the underwriting expense ratio for was points higher than the ratio  primarily reflecting the increases in general and administrative expenses described above  and the impact of declines in fee income 
catastrophe related reinstatement premiums of million and catastrophe related state assessments of million added points to the expense ratio 
written premiums the business insurance segment s gross and net written premiums by market were as follows gross written premiums for the year ended december  in millions select accounts    commercial accounts    national accounts    industry focused underwriting    target risk underwriting    specialized distribution   total business insurance core    business insurance other total business insurance    net written premiums for the year ended december  in millions select accounts    commercial accounts    national accounts    industry focused underwriting    target risk underwriting    specialized distribution   total business insurance core    business insurance other total business insurance    in business insurance core  gross written premiums in declined million  or less than  from the comparable total  whereas net written premiums increased million  or  compared with the difference in growth rates between gross and net written premiums in was concentrated in national accounts and was due to the nature of certain products offered in this market 
a significant portion of gross written premiums for products offered by national accounts is ceded to other insurers  as a result  a decline in gross written premiums does not necessarily have a proportional impact on net written premiums 
all markets in business insurance core operations  except national accounts and specialized distribution  recorded net written premium growth in  driven by higher new business volume throughout the majority of markets coupled with continued strong business retention rates  offset in some markets by minor decreases in renewal price changes

in business insurance core operations  gross written premiums in were down slightly from net written premiums in  however  increased slightly over the disparity between gross and net written premium growth rates in was primarily due to a change in the structure of reinsurance coverage in the company s discover re subsidiary in national accounts that resulted in a decline in ceded premiums 
for purposes of comparison between and net written premium volume  the impact of a higher level of ceded premiums for property catastrophe reinsurance in was virtually equivalent to the impact of the million of catastrophe related reinstatement premiums in net written premium growth in business insurance core operations in was primarily concentrated in target risk underwriting and industry focused underwriting  driven by continued strong business retention rates  renewal price increases and higher new business volume throughout the majority of businesses comprising these markets 
the decline in national accounts net written premiums primarily reflected a reduction in premiums related to favorable loss experience on business priced on a loss sensitive basis and lower new business volume  partially offset by the decline in ceded premiums at discover re due to a change in the structure of reinsurance coverage 
in business insurance other operations  gross and net written premiums were down significantly from the comparable totals  reflecting the sale of the personal catastrophe risk operation in november and the intentional non renewal of business in the runoff operations comprising this category

these factors were partially offset by incremental interest expense in due to debt issuances during the year 
asbestos claims and litigation the company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have attempted to expand insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the intent of insurers and policyholders 
while the company has experienced a decrease in asbestos claims over the past several years  the company continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from the company s policyholders which includes others seeking coverage under a policy  including claims against the company s policyholders by individuals who do not appear to be impaired by asbestos exposure 
factors underlying these claim filings include intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on previously peripheral defendants 
the focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years 
in addition to contributing to the overall number of claims  bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility of asbestos related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers  including the company 
bankruptcy proceedings have also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but that remain in the tort system 
currently  in many jurisdictions  those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts  while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket 
this trend of prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries  along with the focus on previously peripheral defendants  contributes to the loss and loss expense payments experienced by the company 
the company s asbestos related claims and claim adjustment expense experience has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders  whether through exhaustion of policy limits or insolvency 
the company continues to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders  some of whom have filed for bankruptcy  who in some instances have asserted that all or a portion of their asbestos related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage 
in these instances  policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the policy 
it is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues 
to the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholders favor and other company defenses are not successful  the company s coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders 
accordingly  although the company has seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits  it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims 
many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements 
because many policyholders make exaggerated demands  it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations 
settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated 
there also may be instances where a court may not approve a proposed settlement  which may result in additional litigation and potentially less beneficial outcomes for the company 
as in the past  the company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities 
on july   the company announced that it had entered into a settlement to resolve fully all current and future asbestos related coverage claims relating to acands 
under the settlement agreement  the company will contribute million to a trust to be established pursuant to acands plan of reorganization 
in exchange  the company will be released from any obligations it has to acands for asbestos related claims and will be protected from any such claims by injunctions to be issued in the company s favor by the federal court overseeing acands bankruptcy case 
the settlement is subject to a number of contingencies 
on august  the bankruptcy court overseeing acands bankruptcy approved the settlement and no appeals from that approval were taken 
as a result  the company has placed million into escrow 
upon fulfillment of all contingencies  including final court approval of a plan of reorganization for acands and the issuance of the injunctions described above  those funds will be released from escrow to the trust created under acands plan of reorganization 
the release of the funds to the trust will be recorded as a paid claim and a reduction in claim reserves and  accordingly  there will be no effect on the company s results of operations 
the company expects to seek to recover approximately million of the million from reinsurers 
also  see part i item  legal proceedings 
in addition to claims against policyholders  proceedings have been launched directly against insurers  including the company  by individuals challenging insurers conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos related bodily injuries 
the company anticipates the filing of other direct actions against insurers  including the company  in the future 
it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings  including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability 
the company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions 
additionally  travelers property casualty corp 
tpc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  had entered into settlement agreements  which had been approved by the court in connection with the proceedings initiated by tpc in the johns manville bankruptcy court 
on march   the us district court for the southern district of new york substantially affirmed the bankruptcy court s orders  while vacating that portion of the bankruptcy court s orders which required all future direct actions against tpc to first be approved by the bankruptcy court before proceeding in state or federal court 
various parties appealed the district court s march  ruling to the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
on february   the second circuit issued an opinion vacating the district court s order on jurisdictional grounds 
the parties obligations under the settlement agreements are contingent upon approval of the bankruptcy court s order 
unless the second circuit s decision is reversed on further appeal and the bankruptcy court s order is reinstated and becomes final  the settlements will be voided  tpc will have no obligation to pay the amounts due under the settlement agreements other than certain administrative expenses and the company intends to litigate the direct action cases vigorously 
for a description of these matters  see item legal proceedings 
because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues  the company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually 
in the course of this review  the company considers  among other factors available insurance coverage  including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder  limits and deductibles  an analysis of each policyholder s potential liability  the jurisdictions involved  past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims  past settlement values of similar claims  allocated claim adjustment expense  potential role of other insurance  the role  if any  of non asbestos claims or potential non asbestos claims in any resolution process  and applicable coverage defenses or determinations  if any  including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage  if any  for that claim 
in the third quarter of  the company completed its annual in depth asbestos claim review 
as in prior years  the annual review considered active policyholders and litigation cases  including cases challenging the applicability of aggregate limits on asbestos claims 
the trends noted at the completion of the review continued into the trends include the emergence of more stable payment trends for a large proportion of policyholders  a decrease in the number of new claims received  a decrease in the number of large asbestos exposures confronting the company due to additional settlement activity  a decrease in the number and volatility of asbestos related bankruptcies  and the absence of new theories of liability or new classes of defendants 
the company believes that these trends indicate a reduction in the volatility associated with the company s overall asbestos exposure 
nonetheless  there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims 
beginning in the company supplemented the existing annual in depth asbestos claim review and the existing quarterly asbestos review process with additional aggregate quarterly reserve analyses 
these additional analyses provide the company with an increased ability to detect and respond to emerging trends in its quarterly reserve estimates 
the company s asbestos reserve review includes an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category  as well as recent settlements  policyholder bankruptcies  judicial rulings and legislative actions 
developing payment trends among policyholders in the home office  field office and assumed and international categories are also analyzed 
the company also reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience  year by year  to assess any emerging trends  fluctuations  or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity 
for those policyholders for which an estimate of the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and related claim adjustment expense is determined  the company calculates  by each policy year  a ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance  past ceded experience and reinsurance collections 
conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves 
in  the home office and field office categories  which account for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos related claims  continued to experience an overall reduction in new claim filings 
in addition  the number of policyholders tendering asbestos claims for the first time also declined 
however  due to the level of trial activity involving impaired individuals  defense and indemnity costs in these categories remain at levels similar to those previously experienced by the company 
the company s evaluations have not resulted in any data from which a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment may be determined 
payments in the assumed and international category increased in mainly as a result of increased commutation activity 
net asbestos losses and expenses paid in were million  compared with million in gross paid losses in were lower than in primarily due to installment payments made during on settlements reached in prior years 
additionally  net paid losses were lower due to increased reinsurance billings in approximately in and in of total net paid losses related to policyholders with whom the company previously entered into settlement agreements limiting the company s liability 
the company categorizes its asbestos reserves as follows number of policyholders net asbestos reserves total net paid at and for the year ended december  in millions policyholders with settlement agreements home office  field office and other   assumed reinsurance and international total     the policyholders with settlement agreements category includes structured settlements  coverage in place arrangements and  with respect to tpc  wellington accounts 
reserves are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement 
structured settlements are arrangements under which policyholders and or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be paid at scheduled times 
included in this category are tpc s settlements of the statutory and hawaii actions and the common law claims collectively  the direct action settlement 
one of the contingencies of the direct action settlement is affirmance by all appellate courts of the order entered by the us bankruptcy court with respect to the direct action settlement 
on february  the second circuit issued an opinion vacating the district court s order  which had substantially affirmed the bankruptcy court s order 
unless the second circuit s decision is reversed on further appeal and the bankruptcy court s order is reinstated and becomes final  the direct action settlement will be voided  tpc will have no obligation to pay the amounts due under the direct action settlement other than certain administrative expenses and the company intends to litigate the direct action cases vigorously 
in that event  the settlement funds will be returned to tpc s unallocated asbestos reserve 
the company will not make an adjustment to the level of its asbestos reserves as a result of the second circuit s decision 
for a description of these matters  see item legal proceedings 
also included in this category is the company s announced settlement to resolve fully all current and future asbestos related coverage claims relating to acands 
the settlement was approved by the bankruptcy court and no appeals from that approval were taken 
as a result  pursuant to the settlement  a million payment by the company has been placed into escrow 
upon fulfillment of all remaining settlement contingencies  which includes final approval of a plan of reorganization for acands  those funds will be released from escrow to the asbestos trust to be created under acands plan of reorganization 
the funds will be released back to the company if the remaining settlement contingencies are not met 
the acands matter was included in the home office  field office and other category in for a description of this matter  see item legal proceedings 
coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with major policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be provided 
payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums and are only made when valid claims are presented 
wellington accounts refer to the defendants that are parties to a agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims 
many of the aspects of the wellington agreement are similar to those of coverage in place arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed 
home office  field office and other relates to policyholders for which settlement agreements have not been reached  and also includes unallocated ibnr 
policyholders are identified for home office review based upon  among other factors a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold currently  perceived level of exposure  number of reported claims  products completed operations and potential non product exposures  size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder 
in addition to ibnr amounts contained in the reserves for home office and field office policyholders  the company has established a reserve for further adverse development related to existing policyholders  new claims from policyholders reporting claims for the first time and policyholders for which there is  or may be  litigation and direct actions against the company 
assumed reinsurance exposure primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage  including various pool participations 
international is exposed to us asbestos liabilities through participations in excess insurance policies  quota share and excess of loss reinsurance policies  and retrocession policies  underwritten in the london insurance market 
details of exposures under the reinsurance and retrocession policies are identified only when the company is advised by the cedant 
the company recorded no asbestos reserve additions in and recorded pretax asbestos reserve additions of million and million in and  respectively 
approximately half of the million pretax reserve adjustment was due to an increase in the projected defense costs for ten policyholders 
the majority of the remainder of the reserve adjustment was primarily due to continued litigation activity against smaller  peripheral defendants 
the asbestos reserve addition in resulted  in part  from higher than expected defense costs due to increased trial activity for seriously impaired plaintiffs and prolonged litigation before cases are settled or dismissed 
the reserve addition also considered the january court decision voiding  on procedural grounds  the previously rendered favorable arbitration decision in the ongoing acands litigation described in more detail in note

environmental claims and litigation the company continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances 
mostly  these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation 
for instance  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  enacted in and later modified  enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances 
this federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action 
liability under cercla may be joint and several with other responsible parties 
the company has been  and continues to be  involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims 
the company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders 
these decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the company prior to the mid s 
these decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
environmental claims when submitted rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the policyholder  and the company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount 
the resolution of environmental exposures by the company generally occurs by settlement on a policyholder by policyholder basis as opposed to a claim by claim basis 
generally  the company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past  present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder 
this form of settlement is commonly referred to as a buy back of policies for future environmental liability 
in addition  many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation which the company may have for other claims  including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury claims 
the company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which extinguish any future liability arising from known specified sites or claims 
these agreements also include appropriate indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the company 
the company s general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the company s potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs 
in establishing environmental reserves  the company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution  if any 
in the course of this analysis  the company considers the probable liability  available coverage  relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar exposures 
in addition  the company considers the many variables presented  such as the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site  the allegations of environmental harm at each site  the number of sites  the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site  the nature of environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site  the nature of government enforcement activities at each site  the ownership and general use of each site  the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the company and the policyholder  including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder  the involvement of other insurers  the potential for other available coverage  including the number of years of coverage  the role  if any  of non environmental claims or potential non environmental claims in any resolution process  and the applicable law in each jurisdiction 
conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves 
in its review of environmental reserves  the company considers past settlement payments  changing judicial and legislative trends  its reserves for the costs of litigating environmental coverage matters  the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean up actions for both on and off site waste disposal activities  the potential for adverse development  the potential for additional new claims beyond previous expectations  and the potential higher costs for new settlements 
the duration of the company s investigation and review of these claims and the extent of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate  if any  of the value of the claim to the company vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information  the pace of underlying litigation or claim processes  the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the company and the willingness of the policyholder and the company to negotiate  if appropriate  a resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims 
because these factors vary from claim to claim and policyholder by policyholder  the company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration of an environmental claim 
however  based upon the company s experience in resolving these claims  the duration may vary from months to several years 
the company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time 
these policyholders generally present smaller exposures  have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants 
further  in many instances clean up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk based site analyses and more efficient clean up technologies 
however  the company has experienced higher than expected defense and settlement costs driven in part by coverage disputes with its policyholders and adverse judicial developments in certain states regarding the availability of coverage for environmental claims 
in addition  while the company continues to experience a decline in both the number of new policyholders tendering claims for the first time and the number of pending lawsuits between the company and its policyholders pertaining to coverage for environmental claims  the company has seen a moderation in the rate of this decline 
as a result of these factors  the company increased its environmental reserve by million in and million in in  the company increased its environmental reserves by million  primarily for declaratory judgment litigation costs 
net paid losses in and were million and million  respectively 
tpc entered into a significant settlement with one policyholder in tpc executed an agreement with this policyholder which resolved all past  present and future hazardous waste and pollution property damage claims  and all related past and pending bodily injury claims 
in  the company made the final payment related to this settlement and billed a substantial portion of the total settlement to its reinsurers 
in addition  tpc and this policyholder entered into a coverage in place agreement which addressed the handling and resolution of all future hazardous waste and pollution bodily injury claims 
under the coverage in place agreement  tpc has no defense obligation  and there is an overall cap with respect to any indemnity obligation that might be owed 
at december   approximately of the net environmental reserve approximately million was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims  incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims 
the bulk reserve the company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in process environmental claims and the company s experience in resolving those claims 
the balance  approximately of the net environmental reserve approximately million  consists of case reserves 
the following table displays activity for environmental losses and loss expenses and reserves at and for the year ended december  in millions beginning reserves direct ceded net incurred losses and loss expenses direct ceded net losses paid direct ceded net ending reserves direct ceded net uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves as a result of the processes and procedures described above  management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims at december  are appropriately established based upon known facts  current law and management s judgment 
however  the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue  and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation 
as a result  these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop 
the continuing uncertainties include  without limitation  the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation  any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants  a further increase or decrease in asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated  the role of any umbrella or excess policies the company has issued  the resolution or adjudication of some disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the company s previous assessment of these claims  the number and outcome of direct actions against the company and future developments pertaining to the company s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims 
the company s asbestos related claims and claim adjustment expense experience has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders  whether through exhaustion of policy limits or insolvency 
in addition  uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of other defendants  although the company has noted a decrease in the number and volatility of asbestos related bankruptcies 
it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal  regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims 
this development will be affected by future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations  as well as changes in applicable legislation 
it is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or  failing settlement  until the dispute is adjudicated 
this is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective 
as part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves  the company continues to study the implications of these and other developments 
also  see part i item  legal proceedings 
because of the uncertainties set forth above  additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves 
in addition  the company s estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change 
these additional liabilities or increases in estimates  or a range of either  cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the company s operating results in future periods 
investment portfolio the company s invested assets at december  totaled billion  of which was invested in fixed maturity and short term investments  in equity securities  in real estate and in other investments 
because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments  the company employs a conservative investment philosophy 
the company s fixed maturity portfolio at december  totaled billion  comprising billion of publicly traded fixed maturities and million of private fixed maturities 
the weighted average quality ratings of the company s publicly traded fixed maturity portfolio and private fixed maturity portfolio at december  were aa and a  respectively 
included in the fixed maturity portfolio at that date was approximately billion of below investment grade securities 
during  holdings of tax exempt securities were increased to billion to take advantage of their relatively high credit quality and attractive after tax yields 
the average effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio  including short term investments  was excluding short term investments  at both december  and the following table sets forth the company s combined fixed maturity investment portfolio rated using external ratings agencies or by the company when a public rating does not exist at december   in millions carrying value percent of total carrying value quality rating aaa  aa  a  baa  total investment grade  non investment grade  total fixed maturity investments  the company makes investments in residential collateralized mortgage obligations cmos that typically have high credit quality  offer good liquidity and are expected to provide an advantage in yield compared to us treasury securities 
the company s investment strategy is to purchase cmo tranches which offer the most favorable return given the risks involved 
one significant risk evaluated is prepayment sensitivity 
while prepayment risk either shortening or lengthening of duration and its effect on total return cannot be fully controlled  particularly when interest rates move dramatically  the investment process generally favors securities that control this risk within expected interest rate ranges 
the company does not purchase residual interests in cmos 
at december  and  the company held cmos classified as available for sale with a fair value of billion and billion  respectively 
approximately and of the company s cmo holdings are guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by gnma  fnma or fhlmc at december  and  respectively 
in addition  the company held billion and billion of gnma  fnma  fhlmc or fha mortgage backed pass through securities classified as available for sale at december  and  respectively 
virtually all of these securities are rated aaa 
at december  and  the company held commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs of million and billion  respectively 
at december   approximately million of these securities  or the loans backing such securities  contain guarantees by the united states government or a government sponsored enterprise and million were comprised of canadian non guaranteed securities 
the remaining million at december   were comprised of us non guaranteed securities  issued in and prior years 
the average credit rating of these securities was aaa 
the cmbs portfolio is supported by loans that are diversified across economic sectors and geographical areas 
the company does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying credit strength of these securities 
the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  included asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations backed by alternative documentation mortgages with a collective market value of million comprising approximately of the company s total fixed maturity investments 
the company defines sub prime mortgage backed securities as investments which contain loans to borrowers that exhibit one or more of the following characteristics low fico scores  above prime interest rates  high loan to value ratios  high debt to income ratios  low loan documentation eg  limited or no verification of income and assets  or other characteristics that are inconsistent with conventional underwriting standards employed by government sponsored mortgage entities 
alternative documentation mortgages are mortgage loans with low loan documentation as described above 
the average credit rating on all of these securities and obligations held by the company was aaa at december  no securities in the residential mortgage portfolio were downgraded in the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  included securities issued by numerous municipalities with a total carrying value of billion 
approximately billion  or  of the securities were enhanced by third party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default 
such insurance generally results in a rating of aaa being assigned by independent ratings agencies to those securities 
the downgrade of credit ratings of insurers of these securities could result in a corresponding downgrade in the ratings of the securities from aaa to the underlying rating of the respective security without giving effect to the benefit of insurance 
of the total billion of insured municipal securities in the company s investment portfolio  approximately were rated at a or above  and approximately were rated at aa or above  without the benefit of insurance 
the company believes that a loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities  as well as the company s ability and intent to hold the securities 
the company s real estate investments include warehouses and office buildings and other commercial land and properties that are directly owned 
the company s other investments primarily comprise venture capital  through direct ownership and limited partnerships  private equity limited partnerships  joint ventures  other limited partnerships and trading securities  which are subject to more volatility than the company s fixed income investments  but historically have provided a higher return 
at december  and  the carrying value of the company s other investments was billion and billion  respectively 
the company does not believe it has a material exposure to sub prime mortgages within its other investments portfolio based on recent information provided by the limited partnerships 
the net unrealized investment gains losses that were included as a separate component of accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources were as follows for the year ended december  in millions fixed maturities equity securities venture capital other investments excluding venture capital unrealized investment gains before tax provision for taxes net unrealized investment gains at end of year net pretax unrealized investment gains at december  increased by million over year end  primarily driven by the fixed maturity portfolio 
the increase in net unrealized investment gains on fixed maturities was primarily driven by the impact of declining market interest rates on both taxable and tax exempt securities  which were partially offset by an increase in credit spreads and a decrease in unrealized investment gains in the venture capital portfolio  primarily due to sale activities 
in may  the company completed a bundled sale of a substantial portion of its venture capital portfolio  which resulted in the realization of million of previously unrealized net investment gains 
net pretax unrealized investment gains at december  increased by million over year end  primarily concentrated in the fixed maturity portfolio and in other investments carried at fair value 
the increase in net unrealized investment gains on fixed maturities was primarily driven by the impact of declining market interest rates on tax exempt securities  which was partially offset by a slight increase in market interest rates on taxable securities

three of the holdings were public securities whose cost basis was not anticipated to be recovered over the expected holding period 
nine holdings experienced fundamental economic deterioration characterized by less than expected revenues or a fundamental change in product 
the remaining two holdings were impaired due to the impending sale  liquidation or shutdown of the entity

four of the holdings were impaired due to the impending sale  liquidation or shutdown of the entity 
two of the holdings were public securities whose cost basis was not anticipated to be recovered over the expected holding period  and million in other investments excluding venture capital

three of the holdings were impaired due to the impending sale  liquidation or shutdown of the entity 
two of the holdings were public securities whose cost basis was not anticipated to be recovered over the expected holding period  and million in other investments excluding venture capital 
the losses recorded were the result of an equity partnership and a private stock holding which both experienced fundamental deterioration in their financial position 
the specific circumstances that led to the impairments described above did not materially impact other individual investments held during  or the company continually evaluates current developments in the market that have the potential to affect the valuation of the company s investments 
the following table summarizes for all fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale for which fair value is less than of amortized cost or cost at december   the gross unrealized investment loss by length of time those securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position period for which fair value is less than of amortized cost in millions less than months greater than months  less than months greater than months  less than months greater than months total fixed maturities equity securities total unrealized investment losses as of december  represent less than of the portfolio  and  therefore  any impact on the company s financial position would not be significant 
at december   non investment grade securities comprised of the company s fixed income investment portfolio 
included in those categories at december  were securities in an unrealized loss position that  in the aggregate  had an amortized cost of million and a fair value of million  resulting in a net pretax unrealized investment loss of million 
these securities in an unrealized loss position represented approximately of the total amortized cost and approximately of the fair value of the fixed income portfolio at december   and accounted for of the total pretax unrealized investment loss in the fixed income portfolio

reinsurance recoverables ceded reinsurance involves credit risk  except with regard to mandatory pools  and is generally subject to aggregate loss limits 
although the reinsurer is liable to the company to the extent of the reinsurance ceded  the company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured 
reinsurance recoverables are reported after reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for uncollectible amounts 
the company also holds collateral  including trust agreements  escrow funds and letters of credit  under certain reinsurance agreements 
the company monitors the financial condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis and reviews its reinsurance arrangements periodically 
reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition  business practices and the price of their product offerings 
after reinsurance is purchased  the company has limited ability to manage the credit risk to a reinsurer 
in addition  in a number of jurisdictions  particularly the european union and the united kingdom  a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer  which may be less creditworthy  without a counterparty s consent  provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and or court authority 
the company s reinsurance recoverables totaled billion at december   a decline of billion from year end  primarily reflecting significant collections on reinsurance recoverables  including those related to prior year hurricane losses  operations in runoff primarily gulf and various commutation agreements

outlook the company s strategic objective is to enhance its position as a consistently profitable market leader and a cost effective provider of property and casualty insurance in the united states and in selected international markets 
a variety of factors continue to affect the property and casualty insurance market and the company s core business outlook for  including competitive conditions in the markets served by the company s business segments  loss cost trends  interest rate trends and the investment environment 
competition 
the company expects property casualty market conditions to continue to become modestly more competitive in  particularly for new business 
the pricing environment for new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal price changes  particularly in an environment of high retention rates  which the company has experienced over the past several years 
in the business insurance and the financial  professional international insurance segments  the company expects renewal price changes in will modestly decline from their levels 
in the personal insurance segment  the company expects automobile and homeowners renewal price changes will increase slightly compared to their levels 
these expectations for the pricing environment  when combined with expected modestly increased loss costs  will likely result in somewhat reduced underwriting profitability in as compared to loss cost trends 
loss cost trends are primarily driven by changes in claim frequency and claim severity 
the industry has generally experienced unprecedented low levels of non catastrophe related claim frequency over the last several years 
the company expects this trend in claim frequency to continue in in certain lines of business  while claim frequency is expected to increase modestly in other lines of business 
the company also expects severity to increase modestly for non catastrophe related claims 
the company believes that the overall trend of increased frequency and severity of catastrophic gulf and atlantic coast storms experienced in recent years may continue for the foreseeable future  although the trend was not evident in the united states in and given the potential increase in frequency and severity of storms  the company will continue to reassess its definition of  and exposure to  coastal risks 
these risks will be reflected in the pricing and terms and conditions it will offer in coastal areas 
due in part to the increased frequency and severity of the gulf and atlantic coast storms  there has been some disruption in the market for coastal wind insurance  most significantly in personal lines  as insurers  including the company  have reduced capacity and increased prices 
the continued disruption in market conditions  along with the potential for increased frequency and severity of coastal storms  could result in a decrease in the amount of coastal wind coverage that the company is able or willing to write 
in recent periods  the company has recorded net favorable prior year reserve development  primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in all of the company s segments for prior loss years 
if better than expected loss experience continues  the company may record additional net favorable prior year reserve development in in that case  the company may also concurrently revise favorably its current year loss estimates 
however  better than expected loss experience may not continue or may reverse  in which case the company may record no favorable prior year reserve development or net unfavorable prior year reserve development in future periods 
in that case  the company may revise current year loss estimates upward in future periods 
investment returns 
changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new investments 
while a rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available on new fixed income investments  thereby favorably impacting net investment income  it reduces the market value of existing fixed maturity investments  and therefore  shareholders equity 
a decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments  thereby negatively impacting net investment income  but increases the market value of existing investments and therefore  shareholders equity 
in  short term and long term interest rates declined 
a downward trend in interest rates may continue into at december   approximately of the company s invested assets were comprised of equity securities  venture capital investments  private equity limited partnerships  joint ventures  other limited partnerships and trading securities  which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments 
general economic conditions  stock market conditions and many other factors beyond the company s control may affect the value of these non fixed income investments and the realization of net investment income 
the company is not able to predict future market conditions or their impact on net investment income 
net investment income is an important contributor to the company s results of operations  and the company expects the investment environment to become more challenging in  particularly with respect to its non fixed income investment portfolio 
for a discussion of potential risks that could impact the company s financial condition or results of operations  see item a risk factors in this report 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
the liquidity requirements of the company s business have been met primarily by funds generated from operations  asset maturities and income received on investments 
cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses 
the timing and amount of catastrophe claims are inherently unpredictable 
such claims increase liquidity requirements 
the timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes 
additionally  the variability of asbestos related claim payments  as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation  may also result in increased liquidity requirements 
it is the opinion of the company s management that the company s future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the above sources 
the company also maintains liquidity at the holding company level 
at december   total cash  short term invested assets and other readily marketable securities aggregating billion were held at the holding company 
the assets held at the holding company  combined with other sources of funds available  primarily additional dividends from operating subsidiaries  are sufficient to meet the company s current liquidity requirements 
these liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends and debt service 
the company also has the ability to issue securities under its shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission and has access to liquidity through its billion line of credit 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
cash flows in each of and  as compared to the preceding year  reflected higher levels of collected premiums and net investment income  lower claim payments on catastrophe losses  as well as lower runoff claim payments 
cash flows from operations in and benefited from significant collections on reinsurance recoverables in both years  including those related to hurricane losses  operations in runoff primarily gulf and various commutation agreements 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in tax payments resulting from higher profitability  expenses related to increased business volume and continued expenditures to support business growth and product development  and higher interest payments 
cash flows in reflected an increase in loss and loss adjustment expense payments primarily related to the catastrophe losses incurred during and  and an increase in tax payments resulting from higher profitability 
the company utilized million  million and billion of net operating loss nol carryforwards during  and  respectively  thereby reducing current regular tax payments by million  million and million  respectively 
net cash flows provided by operating activities for all three years were negatively impacted by payments for asbestos and environmental liabilities  as well as by payments for claims related to the company s runoff operations 
investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
fixed maturity securities accounted for the majority of investment purchases in all three years 
as discussed in more detail in part i item  legal proceedings  in  the company announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement  subject to contingencies  to resolve fully all current and future asbestos related coverage claims relating to acands  inc as a result  the company has placed million into escrow 
upon fulfillment of all settlement contingencies  including final court approval of a plan of reorganization for acands and the issuance of the injunctions described in part i item  legal proceedings  those funds will be released from escrow to the trust created under acands plan of reorganization 
the company funded the escrow through the purchase of short term securities 
the majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality  liquid intermediate term taxable us government  corporate and mortgage backed bonds and tax exempt us municipal bonds 
the company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments  and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the company s insurance and debt obligations 
the company s management of the duration of the fixed income investment portfolio generally produces a duration that exceeds the estimated duration of the company s net insurance liabilities 
the average duration of fixed maturities and short term securities was at december  and the company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities  venture capital and real estate 
these investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also involve varying degrees of risk  including less stable rates of return and less liquidity 
during  the company sold a substantial portion of its venture capital investment portfolio 
the primary goals of the company s asset liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities  manage the interest rate risk embedded in those insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows 
generally  the expected principal and interest payments produced by the company s fixed income portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the company s insurance reserves 
although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period  the substantial degree by which the market value of the fixed income portfolio exceeds the expected present value of the net insurance liabilities  as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds  provide assurance of the company s ability to fund the payment of claims without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities 
sale of subsidiary 
the company s cash flows in included billion of pretax proceeds after underwriting fees and transaction costs from the divestiture of its equity interest in nuveen investments 
of this amount  million was received directly by the company s insurance subsidiaries  and the remainder was received directly by the holding company 
of the proceeds received directly by the holding company  billion was contributed to the capital of the company s insurance subsidiaries  with the remainder available for general corporate purposes 
financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities of continuing operations totaled billion  billion and million in  and  respectively

tpc 
during the period prior to redemption  the company had repurchased and retired million of the debentures in open market transactions 
upon the company s redemption of the remaining million of subordinated debentures in january  usf g capital ii in turn used the proceeds to redeem its remaining capital securities outstanding 
usf g capital ii was then liquidated  and the company received a million distribution of capital 
the company recorded a million pretax gain on the redemption of the subordinated debentures  due to the remaining unamortized fair value adjustment recorded at the merger date  less the redemption premium paid 
in march  the company issued billion aggregate principal amount of fixed to floating rate junior subordinated debentures due march  for net proceeds of million after original issue discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses 
the debentures were issued at a discount  resulting in an effective interest rate of 
the debentures bear interest at an annual rate of from the date of issuance to  but excluding  march   payable semi annually in arrears on march and september from and including march   the debentures will bear interest at an annual rate equal to three month libor plus  payable quarterly on march  june  september and december of each year 
the company has the right  on one or more occasions  to defer the payment of interest on the debentures 
the company will not be required to settle deferred interest until it has deferred interest for five consecutive years or  if earlier  made a payment of current interest during a deferral period 
the company may defer interest for up to ten consecutive years without giving rise to an event of default 
deferred interest will accumulate additional interest at an annual rate equal to the annual interest rate then applicable to the debentures 
the debentures carry a year final maturity and a scheduled maturity date in year thirty 
during the day period ending not more than fifteen and not less than ten business days prior to the scheduled maturity date  the company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell enough qualifying capital securities  or at its option  common stock  qualifying warrants  mandatorily convertible preferred stock  debt exchangeable for common equity or debt exchangeable for preferred equity to permit repayment of the debentures at the scheduled maturity date 
if any debentures remain outstanding after the scheduled maturity date  the unpaid amount will remain outstanding until the company has raised sufficient proceeds from the sale of qualifying capital securities  or at its option  common stock  qualifying warrants  mandatorily convertible preferred stock  debt exchangeable for common equity or debt exchangeable for preferred equity to permit the repayment in full of the debentures 
if there are remaining debentures at the final maturity date  the company is required to redeem the debentures using any source of funds 
qualifying capital securities are securities other than common stock  qualifying warrants  mandatorily convertible preferred stock  debt exchangeable for common equity  and debt exchangeable for preferred equity which generally are treated by the ratings agencies as having similar equity content to the debentures 
the company can redeem the debentures at its option  in whole or in part  at any time on or after march  at a redemption price of of the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest 
the company can redeem the debentures at its option prior to march  a in whole at any time or in part from time to time or b in whole  but not in part  in the event of certain tax or rating agency events relating to the debentures  at a redemption price equal to the greater of of the principal amount being redeemed and the applicable make whole amount  in each case plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with the offering of the debentures  the company entered into a replacement capital covenant for the benefit of holders of one or more designated series of the company s indebtedness which will initially be the senior notes due 
under the terms of the replacement capital covenant  if the company redeems the debentures at any time prior to march  it can only do so with the proceeds of securities that are treated by the rating agencies as having similar equity content to the debentures 
in march  the company s million  senior notes matured and were fully paid 
in april  the company completed the redemption of its outstanding million  convertible junior subordinated notes due in the notes 
the notes were originally issued by travelers property casualty corp  and the company assumed certain obligations relating to the notes pursuant to a second supplemental indenture dated april  each note had a principal amount of 
the redemption price for each note was plus of accrued and unpaid interest 
any note called for redemption could be surrendered for conversion into common stock before the close of business on april  each note was convertible into shares of common stock of the travelers companies  inc holders of million of the notes tendered their certificates in exchange for the issuance of  of the company s common shares 
the remaining million of notes were redeemed for cash  along with accrued interest to the date of redemption 
the company recorded a million pretax loss million after tax in other revenues in the second quarter of related to the redemption  consisting of the redemption premium paid and the write off of remaining unamortized issuance costs 
in may  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due june  the senior notes  million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due december  the senior notes  and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due june  the senior notes 
the total net proceeds of these three senior note issuances  after original issuance discounts and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses  were approximately billion 
interest on each of the senior note issuances is payable semi annually on june and december  commencing december  each series of senior notes is redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time  at the company s option  at a redemption price equal to the greater of a of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed  or b the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the date of redemption on a semi annual basis assuming a day year consisting of twelve day months at the then current treasury rate plus basis points for the senior notes  basis points for the senior notes and basis points for the senior notes 
the company applied a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repay approximately million of senior notes maturing on august  and to repay approximately million of medium term notes maturing in the third quarter of the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
prior to applying these proceeds  the company invested them in investment grade  marketable securities 
in august  the company s million  senior notes matured and were fully paid 
in  medium term notes with a cumulative par value of million and interest rates ranging from to matured and were fully paid 
in june  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due june  and million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due june  the notes were issued at a discount  resulting in effective interest rates of and  respectively 
net proceeds from the issuances after original issue discount and expenses totaled approximately million  which the company applied to the redemption of approximately million of subordinated debentures described in more detail below  million of senior notes that matured on november  and million of medium term notes that matured in the second half of the year 
in november  the company redeemed million of subordinated debentures originally issued in and due october  the debentures were redeemable by the company on or after november  in november  st 
paul capital trust i  a business trust  issued million of preferred securities  the proceeds of which  along with million in capital provided by the company  were used to purchase the subordinated debentures issued by the company 
upon the company s redemption of its subordinated debentures in november  st 
paul capital trust i in turn used the proceeds to redeem its preferred securities 
st 
paul capital trust i was then liquidated  and the company received an million distribution of capital 
the company recorded a million pretax gain on the redemption of the subordinated debentures  representing the remaining unamortized fair value adjustment recorded at the merger date 
a portion of the proceeds from the june debt issuances described above was used to fund this redemption 
in  the company repaid million of its outstanding debt  primarily comprised of the following maturities of million of senior notes  million of senior notes  and million of medium term notes bearing interest rates ranging from to  and a net repayment of commercial paper borrowings of million 
in november  the company issued million of senior notes maturing in december the majority of the proceeds was used to fund the repayment of commercial paper borrowings described above  with the remainder used for general corporate purposes 
in july  concurrent with the issuance of million of spc common shares in a public offering  spc issued million equity units  each having a stated amount of  for gross consideration of million 
each equity unit initially consisted of a forward purchase contract for the company s common stock  which matured in august  and an unsecured senior note of the company maturing in 
total annual distributions on the equity units were at the rate of  consisting of interest on the note at a rate of and fee payments under the forward contract of 
holders of the equity units had the opportunity to participate in a required remarketing of the senior note component 
the initial remarketing date was may  on that date  the notes were successfully remarketed  and the interest rate on the notes was reset to  from  effective may  the remarketed notes matured on august  the forward purchase contract required the investor to purchase  for  a variable number of shares of the company s common stock on the settlement date of august  the number of shares purchased was determined based on a formula that considered the average closing price of the company s common stock on each of consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the settlement date  in relation to the per share price of common stock at the time of the offering 
on the august  settlement date  the company issued million common shares and received total proceeds of million 
dividends 
dividends paid to shareholders totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
on february   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share  payable march  to shareholders of record on march  the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the company s common stock will be at the discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including the company s financial position  earnings  capital requirements of the company s operating subsidiaries  legal requirements  regulatory constraints and other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
dividends would be paid by the company only if declared by its board of directors out of funds legally available  subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the company 
share repurchases 
in may  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of shares of the company s common stock 
in january  the board of directors authorized an additional billion of share repurchase capacity 
at december   the remaining repurchase capacity under these authorizations was million 
in january  the board of directors authorized an additional billion for share repurchases 
under these authorizations  repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market  pursuant to preset trading plans meeting the requirements of rule b under the securities exchange act of  in private transactions or otherwise 
the authorizations do not have a stated expiration date 
the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors  including corporate and regulatory requirements  price  catastrophe losses and other market conditions

line of credit agreement 
the company maintains an million commercial paper program with back up liquidity consisting of a bank credit agreement 
on june   the company entered into a billion  five year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions 
pursuant to covenants in the credit agreement  the company must maintain an excess of consolidated net worth over goodwill and other intangible assets of not less than billion at all times 
the company must also maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to the sum of total consolidated debt plus consolidated net worth of not greater than to 
in addition  the credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of default  including with respect to a change in control 
at december   the company was in compliance with these covenants and all other covenants related to its respective debt instruments outstanding 
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  the company has an option to increase the credit available under the facility  no more than once a year  up to a maximum facility amount of billion  subject to the satisfaction of a ratings requirement and certain other conditions 
there was no amount outstanding under the credit agreement as of december  shelf registration 
in december  the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement for the potential offering and sale of securities 
the company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering 
during and  the company issued billion and million  respectively  of debt as described above under this shelf registration statement 
share repurchase capacity 
at december   the company had million of capacity remaining under its billion share repurchase program previously approved by the board of directors 
in january  the company s board of directors authorized a billion increase to the program  subject to the factors listed in the share repurchases section above 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes  as of december   the company s future payments under contractual obligations and estimated claims and claims related payments 
the table excludes short term obligations and includes only liabilities at december  that are expected to be settled in cash 
the table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim related payments 
the amounts do not represent the exact liability  but instead represent estimates  generally utilizing actuarial projections techniques  at a given accounting date 
these estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the company s assessment of facts and circumstances then known  review of historical settlement patterns  estimates of trends in claims severity  frequency  legal theories of liability and other factors 
variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  economic inflation  legal trends and legislative changes 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
additionally  there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer 
the future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below required estimation of both amount including severity considerations and timing 
amount and timing are frequently estimated separately 
an estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows related to claims and claim related payments is generally reliable only in the aggregate with some unavoidable estimation uncertainty

represents estimated timing for fulfilling unfunded commitments for investments in real estate partnerships  private equities and hedge funds 
the amounts in claims and claim adjustment expenses in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses  gross of reinsurance recoverables 
the company has entered into reinsurance agreements to protect itself from potential losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept as described in note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in order to qualify for reinsurance accounting  a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk  ie  the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk 
since the timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer  reinsurance receivables are recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities the estimated liability for claims and claims adjustment expense relating to the underlying reinsured contracts 
the presence of any feature that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance 
see below 
the assumptions used in estimating the amount and timing of the reinsurance receivables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities 
reinsurance agreements that do not transfer both amount and timing risk are accounted for as deposits and included in reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits in the table above 
the estimated future cash inflows from the company s reinsurance contracts that qualify for reinsurance accounting are as follows in millions total less than year years years after years reinsurance receivables     the company manages its business and evaluates its liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expense on a net of reinsurance basis 
the estimated cash flows on a net of reinsurance basis are as follows in millions total less than year years years after years claims and claim adjustment expense  net   for business underwritten by non us operations  future cash flows related to reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate on december  the amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance receivables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money 
accordingly  the amounts above will differ from the company s balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and the related reinsurance receivables have been discounted in the balance sheet 
see note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
workers compensation large deductible policies provide third party coverage in which the company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount 
claims from large deductible policies represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the deductible amount  net of the estimated recovery of the deductible 
the liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as contractholder payables and contractholder receivables  respectively 
most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholder s escrow which is periodically replenished by the policyholder 
the payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within claims and claim adjustment expenses in the above table 
because the timing of the collection of the deductible contractholder receivables occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant contractholder payables  these cash flows offset each other in the table 
the estimated timing of the payment of the contractholder payables and the collection of contractholder receivables for workers compensation policies is presented below in millions total less than year years years after years contractholder payables receivables    the amounts in loss based assessments relate to estimated future payments of second injury fund assessments which would result from payment of current claim liabilities 
second injury funds cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre existing condition 
for loss based assessments  the cost is shared by the insurance industry and self insureds  funded through assessments to insurance companies and self insureds based on losses 
amounts relating to second injury fund assessments are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the amounts in reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits represent estimated future nominal payments for reinsurance agreements that are accounted for as deposits 
amounts payable under deposit agreements are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the amounts reported in the table are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money 
accordingly  the amounts above will differ from the company s balance sheet to the extent that deposit values in the balance sheet have been discounted using deposit accounting 
the amounts in payouts from ceded funds withheld represent estimated payments for losses and return of funds held related to certain reinsurance arrangements whereby the company holds a portion of the premium due to the reinsurer and is allowed to pay claims from the amounts held 
amounts are included in the consolidated balance sheet as other liabilities and deferred tax assets 
some of the company s liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits have associated temporary differences for which offsetting current or deferred tax assets exist and are as follows in millions total less than year years years after years receivables related to unrecognized tax benefits the above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of default by the company issuing the annuity 
the company is not reasonably likely to incur material future payment obligations under such agreements 
in addition  the company was not required to make any contributions to its qualified pension plan in or and does not have a best estimate of contributions expected to be paid to the qualified pension plan 
accordingly  any future contributions are not included in the foregoing table 
dividend availability the company s principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the states of connecticut and minnesota 
the insurance holding company laws of both states applicable to the company s subsidiaries requires notice to  and approval by  the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that  together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of of the insurer s capital and surplus as of the preceding december  or the insurer s net income for the twelve month period ending the preceding december  in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation 
this declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus  as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
the insurance holding company laws of other states in which the company s subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar  although in some instances somewhat more restrictive  limitations on the payment of dividends 
a maximum of billion is available by the end of for such dividends without prior approval of the connecticut insurance department for connecticut domiciled subsidiaries and the minnesota department of commerce for minnesota domiciled subsidiaries 
the company received billion of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in risk based capital the naic adopted rbc requirements for property casualty companies to be used as minimum capital requirements by the naic and states to identify companies that merit further regulatory action 
the formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital higher than rbc requirements 
therefore  it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies 
at december   all of the company s insurance subsidiaries had adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring any company or regulatory action 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to agency loans and letters of credit  issuance of debt securities  third party loans related to venture capital investments and various indemnifications related to the sale of business entities to third parties

the company does not expect these arrangements to have a material effect on the company s financial position  changes in financial position  revenues and expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting estimates the company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables  investment impairments and goodwill impairments 
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves claims and claim adjustment expense reserves loss reserves represent management s estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability  but instead represent management estimates  generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques  at a given accounting date 
these loss reserve estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future  based on the company s assessment of facts and circumstances then known  review of historical settlement patterns  estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency  expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors 
in establishing loss reserves  the company also takes into account estimated recoveries  reinsurance  salvage and subrogation 
the loss reserves are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the company 
the process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables 
these variables can be affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process  economic inflation  legal trends and legislative changes  among others 
the impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate 
loss reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity  the volume of claims  the potential severity of individual claims  the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer 
informed judgment is applied throughout the process  including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses 
the company continually refines its loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled 
the company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established 
due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates including  but not limited to  the future settlement environment  final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses may be higher or lower than the related loss reserves at the reporting date 
therefore  actual paid losses in the future may yield a materially different amount than currently reserved favorable or unfavorable 
because establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established loss reserves may change 
the company reflects adjustments to loss reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed 
there are also risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes 
for example  the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability of the company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas  the complexity of factors contributing to the losses  the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves 
complex factors include  but are not limited to determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind  evaluating general liability and pollution exposures  estimating additional living expenses  and estimating the impact of demand surge  infrastructure disruption  fraud  the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs  and reinsurance collectibility 
the timing of a catastrophe s occurrence  such as at or near the end of a reporting period  can also affect the information available to us in estimating reserves for that reporting period 
the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge 
a portion of the company s gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation  which totaled billion at december  while the ongoing review of asbestos claims and associated liabilities and of environmental claims considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage  plaintiffs expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties  in the opinion of the company s management  it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could be material to the company s future operating results 
see the preceding discussion of asbestos claims and litigation and environmental claims and litigation 
gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line were as follows at december  in millions case ibnr total case ibnr total general liability      property     commercial multi peril     commercial automobile      workers compensation     fidelity and surety    personal automobile     homeowners and personal other  international and other     property casualty     accident and health claims and claim adjustment expense reserves   the billion decline in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves in primarily reflected payments related to operations in runoff including asbestos and environmental payments  prior year hurricane losses  and favorable prior year reserve development 
asbestos and environmental reserves are included in the general liability  commercial multi peril lines and international and other lines in the summary table 
asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately  see asbestos claims and litigation  environmental claims and litigation and uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves 
general discussion the process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data 
data on individual reported claims  both current and historical  including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates  are grouped by common characteristics components and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line 
such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate 
the process of analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis  generally quarterly  in light of continually updated information 
multiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities 
each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages  with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components 
the relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time 
therefore  the actual choice of estimation method s can change with each evaluation 
the estimation method s chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated 
in most cases  multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated 
this will result in a range of reasonable estimates for any particular claim liability 
the company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves at the reporting segments are reasonable  given subsequent information 
reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews 
these reviews may substantiate the validity of management s recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate 
the exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature  as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable 
as a result  the company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies 
in addition  potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process 
property casualty insurance policies are either written on a claims made or on an occurrence basis 
policies written on a claims made basis require that claims be reported during the policy period 
policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period  even if the insured reports the loss many years later 
most general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis 
these policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance 
the use of the occurrence form accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures  and it is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability  including construction defect 
occurrence based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends  including future inflation and judicial interpretations and societal litigation dynamics  among others 
a basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future  absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below 
to the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known  such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company and  if available and when appropriate  external data 
such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated 
significant structural changes to the available data  product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process 
informed judgment is applied throughout the reserving process 
this includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses 
in addition to actuaries  experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers  as well as other company management 
therefore  management may have to consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of loss reserves 
it is also likely that during periods of significant change  such as a merger  consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult 
the variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line  depending on the length of the claim tail  the reporting lag  the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line 
product lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail  based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims 
short tail claims are reported and settled quickly  resulting in less estimation variability 
the longer the time before final claim resolution  the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty 
a major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag 
the reporting lag  which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer  makes estimating ibnr inherently more uncertain 
in addition  the greater the reporting lag  the greater the proportion of ibnr claims to the total claim liability for the product line 
writing new products with material reporting lags can result in adding several years worth of ibnr claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable  thereby increasing the risk associated with pricing and reserving such products 
the most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims 
for some lines  the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis 
these lines are generally referred to as being low frequency high severity  while lines without this large claim sensitivity are referred to as high frequency low severity 
estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large claims 
as a result  the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates 
in contrast  high frequency low severity lines tend to have much greater spread of estimation risk  such that the impact of individual claims are relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is narrower and more stable 
claim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate  the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process and the ability to gain an understanding of the data 
product lines with greater claim complexity  such as for certain surety and construction exposures  have inherently greater estimation uncertainty 
actuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves 
the human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty 
different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty  based on their individual backgrounds  professional experiences and areas of focus 
hence  the estimate selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other 
lastly  significant structural changes to the available data  product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process 
the merger of tpc and spc in resulted in the exposure of each other s actuaries and claim departments to different products  data histories  analysis methodologies  claim settlement experts  and more robust data when viewed on a combined basis 
this impacted the range of estimates produced by the company s actuaries  as they reacted to new data  approaches  and sources of expertise to draw upon 
it also resulted in additional levels of uncertainty  as past trends that were a function of past products  past claim handling procedures  past claim departments  and past legal and other experts may not repeat themselves  as those items affecting the trends change or evolve due to the merger 
this also increased the potential for material variation in estimates  as experts can have differing views as to the impact of these frequently evolutionary changes 
events such as mergers increase the inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time  until stable trends reestablish themselves within the new organization 
risk factors the major causes of material uncertainty risk factors generally will vary for each product line  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line 
in a few cases  such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in most cases  they are implicit 
for example  a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year  but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently 
some risk factors will affect more than one product line 
examples include changes in claim department practices  changes in settlement patterns  regulatory and legislative actions  court actions  timeliness of claim reporting  state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud 
the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line 
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components 
the effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases 
for example  estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated with potential court rulings  but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors 
the evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts  sometimes in unanticipated ways 
for example  the timing of claims payments in one geographic region will be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region 
while some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction  others are more evolutionary 
evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values  with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately  in stepwise fashion 
the final impact is not known until all steps have occurred 
sudden changes generally cause a one time shift in claim liability estimates  although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact 
evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates  as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable 
actuarial methods for analyzing and estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves 
the principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the company s actuaries are the paid development method  the case incurred development method  the bornhuetter ferguson bf method  and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development method 
the bf method is usually utilized for more recent accident periods  with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible 
these are typically referred to as traditional actuarial methods 
see glossary for an explanation of these methods 
while these are the principal methods utilized throughout the company  those evaluating a particular component for a product line have available to them the full range of methods developed within the casualty actuarial profession 
the company s actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates 
some components of product line reserves are susceptible to relatively infrequent large claims that can materially impact the total estimate for that component 
in such cases  the company s actuarial analysis generally isolates and analyzes separately such large claims 
the reserves excluding such large claims are generally analyzed using the traditional methods described above 
the reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed utilizing various methods  such as estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods  adjusted for the current environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available 
utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims  combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate accuracy of such claim adjuster estimates 
this monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates 
utilizing historic longer term average ratios of large claims to small claims  and applying such ratios to the estimated ultimate small claims from traditional analysis 
ground up analysis of the underlying exposure typically used for asbestos and environmental 
the results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests  including paid to incurred loss ratios  implied incurred loss to earned premium ratios and non zero claim severity trends 
an actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss development to expected development based on the prior review 
additional analysis may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics  including the investigation of other actuarial methods 
the above is generally utilized to evaluate management s existing estimate for prior accident periods 
for the initial estimate of the current accident year  the available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication 
hence  the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on a loss ratio projection method  which uses the earned premium for the current year multiplied by a projected loss ratio 
the projected loss ratio is determined through analysis of prior experience periods using loss trend  rate level differences  mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident years 
the exact number of prior accident years utilized varies by product line component  based on the volume of business for that component and the reliability of an individual accident year estimate 
management s estimates at least once per quarter  certain company management meets with its actuaries to review the latest claims and claim adjustment expense reserve analyses 
based on these analyses  management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed 
in doing so  it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability 
for example  as described above  payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims 
the resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment 
it is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event 
even if a change is determined to be permanent  it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later 
the overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several months to perform 
this is due to the need to evaluate the underlying cause of the trends observed  and may include the gathering or assembling of data not previously available 
it may also include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes 
as a result  there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the company s estimated claim liabilities 
the final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data  adjusted to reflect any new actionable information 
discussion of product lines the following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line 
there are many additional risk factors that may impact ultimate claim costs 
each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves 
also  risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves 
for example  in workers compensation  the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster  thereby lowering indemnity costs 
thus  in almost all cases  it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation 
in order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line  the historical changes in year end loss reserves over a one year period are provided for the us product lines 
this information is provided for both the company and the industry for the nine most recent years  and is based on the most recent publicly available data for the reported line s that most closely match the individual product line being discussed 
these changes were calculated  net of reinsurance  from statutory annual statement data found in schedule p of those statements  and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning of the year claim liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities  all accident years combined  excluding non defense related claim adjustment expense 
data presented for the company includes history for the entire travelers group us companies only  whether or not the individual subsidiaries were originally part of spc or tpc 
this treatment is required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated by state regulatory authorities for schedule p 
comparable data for non us companies is not available 
general liability general liability is generally considered a long tail line  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year 
the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided  the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self insured retentions 
there are numerous components underlying the general liability product line 
some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within to years  while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims eg  a reporting lag of a decade or more for construction defect claims 
while the majority of general liability coverages are written on an occurrence basis  certain general liability coverages such as those covering directors and officers or professional liability are typically insured on a claims made basis 
general liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components primary and excess umbrella  with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property damage 
bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder s legal obligation arising from non intentional acts such as negligence  subject to the insurance policy provisions 
in some cases the damages can include future wage loss which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation and future medical treatment costs 
property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant s private property arising from the policyholder s legal obligation for non intentional acts 
in most cases  property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date  or soon thereafter 
in addition  sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately  such as asbestos  environmental  other mass torts  construction defect  medical malpractice and large unique accounts that would otherwise distort the analysis 
these unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on traditional actuarial methods 
defense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant  sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims 
for some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the amount of policy limit available to pay the claim 
such defense within the limits policies are most common for claims made products 
when defense costs are outside of the limits  amounts paid for defense costs do not erode the policy limits 
this line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the united states excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk 
major contributors to this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag ie  the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim  the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action  whether the event triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods  the potential dollars involved in the individual claim actions  whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written ie  coverage dispute potential  and the potential for mass claim actions 
claims with longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk 
this is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature  particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years  hence involving multiple defendants and their insurers and reinsurers and multiple policies thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity 
claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag  ie  the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and or latent claim exposure 
the amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line 
the components in this product line with the longest latency  longest reporting lags  largest potential dollars involved  and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental 
components that include latency  reporting lag and or complexity issues  but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental  include construction defect  medical malpractice  and other mass tort actions 
many components of general liability are not subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components 
in general  policies providing coverage with shorter reporting lags  fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations  only one policy potentially triggered per claim  fewer potential settlement dollars  reasonably foreseeable and stable potential hazards claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than policies without those characteristics 
besides the traditional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section  the company utilizes various report year development methods and s curves for the construction defect components of this product line 
the construction defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for ibnr claim counts 
for components with greater lags in claim reporting  such as excess and umbrella components of this product line  the company utilizes the bf method more heavily than paid and case incurred development

as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for general liability excluding asbestos and environmental  a increase decrease in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a increase decrease in loss reserves 
historically  the one year change in the reserve estimate for this product line  excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts  over the last nine years has varied from to averaging for the company and to averaging for the industry overall 
the company s year to year changes are driven by and are based on observed events during the year 
because the high end of the company s range of historical adverse development came from certain business that has since been exited  the company believes that the industry s range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one year changes in reserve estimates for this product line 
general liability reserves excluding asbestos and environmental represent approximately of the company s total loss reserves 
the company s change in reserve estimate for this product line  excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts  was for  for and for the change was driven by better than expected loss development for recent accident years attributable to several factors  including improved legal and judicial environments  as well as enhanced risk control  underwriting and claim process initiatives 
the change largely resulted from directors and officers and errors and omissions adjustments due to worse than expected large loss activity and additional information from detailed claim reviews  primarily associated with accident years and the change was the net result of numerous adjustments for various components with no individual item being a primary driver 
property property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability coverages  and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process except for more complex business interruption claims 
it is generally viewed as a moderate frequency  low to moderate severity line  except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties 
the claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer 
overall  the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk  except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims 
property reserves are typically analyzed in two components  one for catastrophic or other large single events  and another for all other events 
examples of common risk factors  or perceptions thereof  that could change and  thus  affect the required property reserves beyond those included in the general discussion section include property risk factors physical concentration of policyholders availability and cost of local contractors for the more severe catastrophic events  demand surge inflation  which refers to significant short term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services local building codes amount of time to return property to full usage for business interruption claims court interpretation of policy provisions such as occurrence definition  or wind versus flooding lags in reporting claims eg  winter damage to summer homes  hidden damage after an earthquake court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations property book of business risk factors policy provisions mix eg  deductibles  policy limits  endorsements changes in underwriting standards unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves

because the high end of the company s range of historical adverse development came from certain business that has since been exited  the company believes that the industry s range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one year changes in reserve estimates for this product line 
property reserves represent approximately of the company s total loss reserves 
while property is considered a short tail coverage  the one year change can be more volatile than the longer tail product lines 
this is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve relates to the most recent accident year  which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines 
this recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property due to weather related events which tend to be concentrated in the last half of the year and generally do not clearly resolve until the following year 
the company s change in reserve estimate for this product line was for  for and for the change was due to fewer than expected late reported claims related to non catastrophe weather events that occurred late in as well as better than expected frequency and severity due in part to changes in the marketplace  such as higher deductibles and lower policy limits 
in addition  the property product line experienced better than expected large loss outcomes which were partially attributable to favorable litigation resolutions 
the change primarily reflected less demand surge inflation than originally estimated for accident year non catastrophe and catastrophe losses 
the change was primarily due to better than expected results from changes in policy provisions as well as underwriting and pricing criteria 
the reserve estimates for this product line are also potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for unprecedented significant catastrophes such as the events of september  and hurricane katrina 
such material changes did not materialize in  or commercial multi peril commercial multi peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and  therefore  includes both short and long tail coverages 
for property coverage  it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims  while for the other coverages  generally for the liability coverages  it takes a longer period of time to close claims 
the reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product  except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses 
the reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer 
commercial multi peril is generally sold to smaller sized accounts  while the customer profile for general liability and property include larger customers 
see property risk factors and general liability risk factors  discussed above  with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi peril 
unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves

commercial multi peril reserves excluding asbestos and environmental reserves represent approximately of the company s total loss reserves 
as discussed above  this line combines general liability and property coverages and it has been impacted in the past by many of the same events as those two lines 
the company s change in reserve estimate for this product line was for  for and for the and changes were attributable to better than expected results due to  among other factors  increasingly favorable legal and judicial environments as well as enhanced risk control  underwriting and claim process initiatives 
the change was the result of increasingly favorable legal and judicial environments  coupled with better than expected results from changes in policy provisions as well as underwriting and pricing criteria 
commercial automobile the commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and  therefore  includes both short and long tail coverages 
the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage property claims and property damage liability claims 
the payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims 
in general  claim reporting lags are minor  claim complexity is not a major issue  and the line is viewed as high frequency  low to moderate severity 
overall  the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk 
commercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components  bodily injury liability  property damage liability  collision claims and comprehensive claims 
these last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and  accordingly  separate risk factors are not presented 
the company utilizes the traditional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion above in estimating claim liabilities for this line 
this is supplemented with detailed custom analyses where needed 
examples of common risk factors  or perceptions thereof  that could change and  thus  affect the required commercial automobile reserves beyond those included in the general discussion section include bodily injury and property damage liability risk factors trends in jury awards changes in the underlying court system changes in case law litigation trends frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits change in average severity of accidents  or proportion of severe accidents changes in auto safety technology subrogation opportunities changes in claim handling philosophies frequency of visits to health providers number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers types of health providers used types of medical treatments received changes in cost of medical treatments degree of patient responsiveness to treatment commercial automobile book of business risk factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  policy limits  endorsements  etc

the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one year changes in reserve estimates for this product line 
commercial automobile reserves represent approximately of the company s total loss reserves 
the company s change in reserve estimate for this product line was for  for and for the change was due to better than expected loss development  for recent accident years  as a result of more favorable legal and judicial environments  claim handling initiatives and improvements in auto safety technology 
the change was due to better than expected loss development  primarily for accident years through  which was attributable to favorable legal and judicial environments  claim handling initiatives and improvements in auto safety technology 
the change was due to the effect of increasingly favorable legal and judicial environments as well as better than expected results from changes in policy provisions as well as underwriting and pricing criteria  especially for accident year workers compensation workers compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year 
while certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly  some other payments are made over the course of several years  such as awards for permanent partial injuries 
in addition  some payments can run as long as the injured worker s life  such as permanent disability benefits and on going medical care 
despite the possibility of long payment tails  the reporting lags are generally short  settlements are generally not complex  and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity 
the largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency  high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker s injury 
overall  the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk 
workers compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components indemnity losses  medical losses and claim adjustment expenses 
examples of common risk factors  or perceptions thereof  that could change and  thus  affect the required workers compensation reserves beyond those included in the general discussion section include indemnity risk factors time required to recover from the injury degree of available transitional jobs degree of legal involvement changes in the interpretations and processes of the workers compensation commissions oversight of claims future wage inflation for states that index benefits changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds medical risk factors changes in the cost of medical treatments including prescription drugs and underlying fee schedules inflation frequency of visits to health providers number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers types of health providers used type of medical treatments received use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices availability of new medical processes and equipment changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs degree of patient responsiveness to treatment general workers compensation risk factors frequency of claim reopenings on claims previously closed mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment degree of cost shifting between workers compensation and health insurance workers compensation book of business risk factors product mix injury type mix changes in underwriting standards unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves

duties include the determination of whether a given injury arose out of the scope of employment  or the determination of the degree of injury where disputes exist 
fidelity and surety fidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage 
it takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle fidelity claims 
the volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured  the size and complexity of the insured s business operations  amount of policy limit and attachment point of coverage 
the uncertainty surrounding reserves for small  commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions 
the high frequency  low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates whereas  the low frequency  high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider range of ultimate loss outcomes 
actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency  high severity policies 
surety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags  although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can result in a long settlement tail  based on the length and complexity of the construction project or commercial transaction being insured 
large construction projects can take many years to complete 
the frequency of losses in surety correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability to perform financially 
the volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the insured  the type of bonded obligation  the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses  such as unbilled contract funds  collateral  first and third party indemnity  and other security positions of an insured s assets 
certain classes of surety claims are very high severity  low frequency in nature 
these can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large  complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures 
other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured eg  salvage and subrogation efforts and the results of financial restructuring of an insured 
examples of common risk factors  or perceptions thereof  that could change and  thus  affect the required fidelity and surety reserves beyond those included in the general discussion section include fidelity risk factors type of business of insured policy limit and attachment points third party claims coverage litigation complexity of claims growth in insureds operations surety risk factors economic trends  including the general level of construction activity concentration of reserves in a relatively few large claims type of business insured type of obligation insured cumulative limits of liability for insured assets available to mitigate loss defective workmanship latent defects financial strategy of insured changes in statutory obligations geographic spread of business fidelity and surety book of business risk factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  limits  endorsements changes in underwriting standards unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves

personal automobile personal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages 
the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage property claims and property damage liability claims 
the payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims 
reporting lags are relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products 
it is generally viewed as a high frequency  low to moderate severity product line 
overall  the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk 
personal automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components bodily injury liability  property damage liability  no fault losses  collision claims and comprehensive claims

the company s change in reserve estimate for this product line was for  for and for the decreases in  and were primarily due to better than expected results from changes in claim handling practices as well as initiatives to fight fraud 
homeowners and personal lines other homeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage 
most payments are related to the property portion of the policy  where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer 
claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs  although delays of several months are not unusual 
the claim is settled when the two parties agree on the amount due in accordance with the policy contract language and the appropriate payment is made or alternatively  the property replacement repair is performed by the insurer 
the resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term  although exceptions do exist 
the liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation  but with generally small reporting lags 
in addition  reserves related to umbrella coverages have greater uncertainty since umbrella liability payments are often made far into the future 
overall  the line is generally high frequency  low to moderate severity except for catastrophes  with simple to moderate claim complexity 
homeowners reserves are typically analyzed in two components non catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments 
examples of common risk factors  or perceptions thereof  that could change and  thus  affect the required homeowners reserves beyond those included in the general discussion section include non catastrophe risk factors salvage opportunities amount of time to return property to residential use changes in weather patterns local building codes litigation trends trends in jury awards catastrophe risk factors physical concentration of policyholders availability and cost of local contractors local building codes quality of construction of damaged homes amount of time to return property to residential use for the more severe catastrophic events  demand surge inflation  which refers to significant short term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services homeowners book of business risk factors policy provisions mix eg  deductibles  policy limits  endorsements  etc

the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one year changes in reserve estimates for this product line 
homeowners and personal lines other reserves represent approximately of the company s total loss reserves 
this line combines both liability and property coverages  however the majority of the reserves relate to property 
while property is considered a short tail coverage  the one year change can be more volatile than the longer tail product lines 
this is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve relates to the most recent accident year  which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines 
this recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property due to weather related events which tend to be concentrated in the last half of the year and generally do not clearly resolve until the following year 
the company s change in reserve estimate for this product line was for  for and for the change was due to fewer than expected late reported claims related to non catastrophe weather events that occurred in the fourth quarter of in addition  a portion of the change was attributable to a decrease in the number of claims due to changes in the marketplace  including higher deductibles and fewer small dollar claims 
the change was due to lower than expected additional living expenses related to hurricane katrina as well as better than expected non catastrophe related frequency and severity  due in part to changes in the marketplace  such as higher deductibles and fewer small dollar claims  and continued evidence of a less than expected impact from demand surge 
the change was driven by additional loss development from the florida hurricanes 
international and other international and other includes products written by international and other products not discussed above 
the principal component of other claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess of loss basis  which may include reinsurance of non us exposures  and is primarily runoff business 
international and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages  currencies and jurisdictions countries 
the common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the individual component  and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the us statutory reporting framework 
due to changes in the business mix for this line over time  the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively short term due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved  eg  the republic of ireland and the united kingdom  while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely long tail eg  eg excess liabilities reinsured through the london market  and several underwriting pools in runoff 
the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided  the jurisdiction  the distribution system eg  underwriting pool versus direct  and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard eg  insured and insurer located in different countries 
in particular  liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags  settlement lags and claim complexity  due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co insurers through a broker or lead insurer for claim settlement purposes 
international and other reserves are generally analyzed by program pool  country and general coverage category eg  eg liability excess of loss reinsurance  or general liability municipalities by country 
the business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage jurisdiction 
where the underlying insured hazard is outside the united states  the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the general liability and automobile discussion above  but under a different legal system 
where the underlying hazard is within the us  the coverage involved is typically that of general liability  but on an excess or excess of loss reinsurance basis 
excess exposure requires the insured to prove not only claims under the policy  but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess policy s attachment point 
examples of common risk factors  or perceptions thereof  that could change and  thus  affect the required international and other reserves beyond those included in the general discussion section include international and other risk factors changes in claim handling procedures  including those of the primary carriers changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision new theories of liability trends in jury awards changes in the propensity to sue changes in statutes of limitations changes in the underlying court system distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues changes in tort law changes in claim adjuster office structure causing distortions in the data international and other book of business risk factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  policy limits  endorsements  claims made language changes in underwriting standards product mix eg  size of account  industries insured  jurisdiction mix unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves 
as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for international and other excluding asbestos and environmental  a increase decrease in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a increase decrease in loss reserves 
international and other reserves excluding asbestos and environmental represent approximately of the company s total loss reserves 
international and other represents a combination of different product lines  some of which are in runoff 
comparative historical information is not available for international product lines as insurers domiciled outside of the us do not file us statutory reports 
comparative historical information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible one year changes in the reserve estimate for this mix of runoff business 
accordingly  the company has not included comparative analyses for international and other 
reinsurance recoverables amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability 
the company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  the company becomes involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers 
some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the company s rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements 
the company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes 
the company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables 
the allowance is based upon the company s ongoing review of amounts outstanding  length of collection periods  changes in reinsurer credit standing  disputes  applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors 
accordingly  the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates 
from time to time  the company considers the commutation of reinsurance contracts 
changes in estimated reinsurance recoverables and commutation activity could result in additional income statement charges 
total reinsurance recoverables at december  declined by billion from the same date in  primarily reflecting significant collections on reinsurance recoverables  including those related to prior year hurricane losses  operations in runoff primarily gulf and various commutation agreements 
the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance at december  declined by million from the same date in  generally due to settlement activity and commutations 
recoverables attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims  for which the company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities 
recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate primarily to workers compensation service business and have the obligation of the participating insurance companies on a joint and several basis supporting these cessions

the pricing service utilizes market quotations for securities eg  public common and preferred and certain eg treasuries that have quoted prices in active markets 
since many fixed maturities do not trade on a daily basis  the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications which include available relevant market information  benchmark curves  benchmarking of like securities  sector groupings  and matrix pricing 
additionally  the pricing service uses an option adjusted spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios 
the pricing service evaluates each asset class on its own based on relevant market information  relevant credit information  perceived market movements and sector news 
the market inputs utilized in the pricing evaluation  listed in the approximate order of priority  include benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers  reference data  and industry and economic events 
the extent of the use of each market input depends on the asset class and the market conditions 
depending on the security  the priority of use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant 
additionally  for some securities additional inputs may be necessary 
the nationally recognized pricing service utilized by the company has indicated that they will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation 
if the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment  the company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service  but would have to make assumptions for market based inputs that are unavailable due to market conditions 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable  unrelated willing parties 
as such  the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold immediately 
additionally  valuation of fixed income investments is more subjective when the markets are illiquid due to the lack of market based inputs  which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value ie  the carrying amount of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur 
real estate fair value is established at the time of acquisition by internal analysis or external appraisers  using discounted cash flow analyses and other acceptable techniques 
the company had no real estate held for sale at december  or other investments the company s investment portfolio includes non publicly traded investments  such as venture capital investments as discussed below  private equity limited partnerships  joint ventures  other limited partnerships  certain fixed income and equity securities  and stock purchase warrants of a publicly traded company 
the company uses the equity method of accounting for joint ventures and limited partnerships 
certain other private equity investments  including venture capital investments  are reported at estimated fair value 
these non publicly traded securities are valued based on factors such as recent financial information  available market data  and management judgment 
venture capital investments in may  the company completed the bundled sale of a substantial portion of its venture capital portfolio 
prior to the sale  these venture capital investments were consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the company s venture capital investments are generally non publicly traded instruments in early stage companies and  historically  have a holding period of four to seven years 
these investments are primarily in the health care  software and computer services  and networking and information technologies infrastructures industries 
certain venture capital investments that are controlled by the company are consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the underlying investments of these venture capital investments are reported at estimated fair value 
the fair value of the venture capital investments is based on an estimate determined by the external fund manager and reviewed by the company for investments in which there is no public market 
the external fund manager reviews such factors as recent filings  operating results  balance sheet stability  growth  and other business and market sector fundamental statistics in estimating fair values of specific investments 
with respect to the company s valuation of such non publicly traded venture capital investments  on a quarterly basis  the company s portfolio managers and the external fund manager review and consider a variety of factors in determining the valuation of the investments and the potential for other than temporary impairments 
factors considered include the following the investee s most recent financing events  an analysis of whether a fundamental deterioration or improvement has occurred  whether the investee s progress has been substantially more or less than expected  whether or not the valuations have improved or declined significantly in the investee s market sector  whether or not the external fund manager and the company believe it is probable that the investee will need financing within six months at a lower price than our carrying value  and whether or not the company has the ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery  enabling it to receive value equal to or greater than our cost 
the quarterly valuation procedures described above are in addition to the portfolio managers ongoing responsibility to frequently monitor developments affecting those invested assets  paying particular attention to events that might give rise to impairment write downs 
investment impairments the company recognizes an impairment loss when an invested asset s value declines below cost  adjusted for accretion  amortization and previous other than temporary impairments new cost basis  and the change is deemed to be other than temporary  or if it is determined that the company will not be able to recover all amounts due pursuant to the issuers contractual obligations prior to sale or maturity 
when the company determines that an invested asset is other than temporarily impaired  the invested asset is written down to fair value  and the amount of the impairment is included in earnings as a realized investment loss 
the fair value then becomes the new cost basis of the investment  and any subsequent recoveries in fair value are recognized at disposition 
the company recognizes a realized loss when impairment is deemed to be other than temporary even if a decision to sell an invested asset has not been made 
when the company has decided to sell a temporarily impaired available for sale invested asset and the company does not expect the fair value of the invested asset to fully recover prior to the expected time of sale  the invested asset is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired in the period in which the decision to sell is made 
factors considered in determining whether a decline is other than temporary include the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been below cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery 
the company s process for reviewing invested assets for impairments during any quarter includes the following identification and evaluation of investments that have possible indications of other than temporary impairment  which includes an analysis of investments with gross unrealized investment losses that have fair values less than of cost for six consecutive months or more  review of portfolio manager s recommendations for other than temporary impairments based on the investee s current financial condition  liquidity  near term recovery prospects and other factors  consideration of evidential matter  including an evaluation of factors or triggers that may cause individual investments to qualify as having other than temporary impairments  and determination of the status of each analyzed investment as other than temporary or not  with documentation of the rationale for the decision 
sales of temporarily impaired invested assets the company may  from time to time  sell invested assets subsequent to the balance sheet date that were considered temporarily impaired at the balance sheet date 
such sales are generally due to events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date that result in a change in the company s intent or ability to hold an invested asset 
the types of events that may result in a sale include significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances related to the invested asset  significant unforeseen changes in the company s liquidity needs  or changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment 
fixed maturities and equity securities an investment in a fixed maturity or equity security which is available for sale is impaired if its fair value falls below its cost or new cost basis  and the decline is considered to be other than temporary 
a fixed maturity security is other than temporarily impaired if it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due under the security s contractual terms or where the company does not have the intent to hold the security 
equity securities are other than temporarily impaired when it becomes apparent that the company will not recover its cost over the expected holding period 
further  for securities expected to be sold  an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized if the company does not expect the fair value of a security to recover prior to the expected date of sale 
additionally  for certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows including asset backed securities  the company periodically updates its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security 
if management determines that the fair value of a securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  then an other than temporary impairment is recognized 
real estate investments the carrying value of a real estate property is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the review for impairment includes an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the real estate property 
an impairment loss is recognized if the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the real estate property 
the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value 
other investments mortgage loans a mortgage loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect principal and interest amounts due 
for mortgage loans that are determined to be impaired  a reserve is established for the difference between the amortized cost and fair market value of the underlying collateral 
in estimating fair value  the company uses interest rates reflecting the current real estate financing market returns 
impaired loans were not material at december  and venture capital investments and non publicly traded investments venture capital investments and non publicly traded investments are reviewed quarterly for other than temporary impairment by the external fund manager and the company s portfolio managers 
an impairment loss is recognized if  based on the specific facts and circumstances  it is probable that the company will not be able to recover all of the cost of an individual holding 
other investments excluding venture capital investments included in other investments are partnership investments and investments in limited liability companies together partnerships that generally report investments on their balance sheet at fair value 
the partnership investments include private equity investments and investments in hedge funds 
the managers general partners of the private equity partnerships provide financial information quarterly which is generally available to investors  including the company  within three to six months following the date of the reporting period 
the hedge funds provide financial information monthly which is available to investors within one month following the date of the reporting period 
the company reviews these investments for impairment no less frequently than quarterly and monitors the performance throughout the year through discussions with the managers general partners 
if the company becomes aware of an other than temporary impairment of a partnership investment at the balance sheet date prior to receiving financial information  it will record an impairment charge consistent with the company s impairment policy 
intangible impairments the company performs a review on at least an annual basis  of goodwill held by its reporting units  which are the company s three operating and reportable segments business insurance  financial  professional international insurance and personal insurance 
the impairment test of goodwill is a two step process 
the first step is to identify any potential impairment using a multiple of earnings approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the fair values of the reporting units are then compared to their carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying amounts of the reporting units exceed their fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the company s review did not result in an impairment of goodwill for the years ended december   and other indefinite lived intangible assets held by the company are also reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
the classification of the asset as indefinite lived is reassessed and an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company s review did not result in an impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets for the years ended december   and other uncertainties for a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impact the company s results of operations or financial position  see note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements and item a risk factors 
future application of accounting standards see note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
the company is currently required to prepare its financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
during  the securities and exchange commission sec issued a proposed release for comment that would allow us domestic companies the option to prepare their financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs  as promulgated by the international accounting standards board iasb  instead of in accordance with gaap 
the sec is considering comments it has received and may make a further proposal during the sec has also indicated that it is considering whether to require us domestic companies to prepare their financial statements in accordance with ifrs  however  the company would not expect any such requirement to take effect for at least a number of years 
the iasb is currently evaluating ifrs as it applies to insurance companies 
among other things  the iasb is considering methodologies for valuing insurance contract liabilities that may be significantly different from the methodologies required by gaap 
the fasb and the iasb are also embarked on a long term project to converge gaap and ifrs 
the company is not able to predict whether it will choose to  or be required to  adopt ifrs or how the adoption of ifrs or the convergence of gaap and ifrs may impact the company s financial statements in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are managed as of december  the company s market risk sensitive instruments  including derivatives  are primarily entered into for purposes other than trading 
the carrying value of the company s investment portfolio as of december  and was billion and billion  respectively  of which was invested in fixed maturity securities at both dates 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s invested assets were denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s exposure to equity price risk is not significant 
the company has no direct commodity risk 
the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  included asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations backed by alternative documentation mortgages with a collective market value of million comprising approximately of the company s total fixed maturity investments 
the company defines sub prime mortgage backed securities as investments which contain loans to borrowers that exhibit one or more of the following characteristics low fico scores  above prime interest rates  high loan to value ratios  high debt to income ratios  low loan documentation eg  limited or no verification of income and assets  or other characteristics that are inconsistent with conventional underwriting standards employed by government sponsored mortgage entities 
alternative documentation mortgages are mortgage loans with low loan documentation as described above 
the average credit rating on all of these securities and obligations held by the company was aaa at december  no securities in the residential mortgage portfolio were downgraded in the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  included securities issued by numerous municipalities with a total carrying value of billion 
approximately billion  or  of the securities were enhanced by third party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default 
such insurance generally results in a rating of aaa being assigned by independent ratings agencies to those securities 
the downgrade of credit ratings of insurers of these securities could result in a corresponding downgrade in the ratings of the securities from aaa to the underlying rating of the respective security without giving effect to the benefit of insurance 
of the total billion of insured municipal securities in the company s investment portfolio  approximately were rated at a or above  and approximately were rated at aa or above  without the benefit of insurance 
the company believes that a loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities  as well as the company s ability and intent to hold the securities 
the primary market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
the portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through cash market transactions and treasury futures transactions 
the primary market risk for all of the company s debt is interest rate risk at the time of refinancing 
the company monitors the interest rate environment and evaluates refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach 
for additional information regarding the company s debt see note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements as well as the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis 
the company s foreign exchange market risk exposure is concentrated in the company s invested assets and insurance reserves denominated in foreign currencies 
cash flows from the company s foreign operations are the primary source of funds for the purchase of investments denominated in foreign currencies 
the company purchases these investments primarily to fund insurance reserves and other liabilities denominated in the same currency  effectively reducing its foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
invested assets denominated in the british pound sterling comprised approximately and of the total invested assets at december  and  respectively 
no other individual foreign currency accounted for more than of the company s invested assets at december  or there were no other significant changes in the company s primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in the company s sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
interest rate risk in this sensitivity analysis model  the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes the following financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading fixed maturities  non redeemable preferred stocks  mortgage loans  short term securities  debt and derivative financial instruments 
the primary market risk to the company s market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
for invested assets with primary exposure to interest rate risk  estimates of portfolio duration and convexity are used to model the loss of fair value that would be expected to result from a parallel increase in interest rates 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put and interest rate reset features 
durations on tax exempt securities are adjusted for the fact that the yields on such securities do not normally move in lockstep with changes in the us treasury curve 
fixed maturity portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  including accrued interest  using holdings as of december  and for debt  the change in fair value is determined by calculating hypothetical december  and ending prices based on yields adjusted to reflect a basis point change  comparing such hypothetical ending prices to actual ending prices  and multiplying the difference by the par or securities outstanding 
the sensitivity analysis model used by the company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately billion and billion based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  and  respectively 
the loss estimates do not take into account the impact of possible interventions that the company might reasonably undertake in order to mitigate or avoid losses that would result from emerging interest rate trends 
in addition  the loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
as a result  the loss value excludes a significant portion of the company s consolidated balance sheet  primarily claims and claim adjustment expense reserves  which if included in the sensitivity analysis model  would mitigate the impact of the loss in fair value associated with a basis point increase in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company uses fair values of investment securities to measure its potential loss from foreign denominated investments 
a hypothetical reduction in value of foreign denominated investments is used to estimate the impact on the market value of the foreign denominated holdings 
the potential loss is reduced by foreign currency forward transactions that are used to hedge a portion of the company s exposure to foreign currencies 
the company s analysis indicates that a hypothetical reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively
