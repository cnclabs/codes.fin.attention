item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview our business is to alleviate pain  promote healing and restore function by developing innovative osteobiologic solutions for regenerative medicine 
our goal is to utilize our current and future technology platforms to develop tissue forms and products to create procedure specific solutions to repair and replace bone loss caused by trauma or disease states  augment prosthetic implant procedures  facilitate spinal fusion and replace and or repair damaged ligaments and tendons 
we provide our osteobiologic solutions to orthopedic  spinal  neurosurgical and oral maxillofacial surgeons for use in the various surgical procedures designed to facilitate the repair of the musculoskeletal system 
we generate the majority of our revenues from fees charged for our products  which are distributed to hospitals and surgeons 
when we distribute our products directly to surgeons and hospitals  we charge a service fee to the hospital based upon our published end user list price or  in certain instances  based upon a negotiated discount to our end user list price 
we generally charge a contracted service fee for each product provided to stocking distributors 
we also generate revenues by processing allograft bone tissue for partner companies or clients  primarily mtf  into traditional allograft bone tissue grafts  grafton dbm or private label dbm products  which we return to our partners and clients and they distribute to hospitals and surgeons 
when we process allograft bone tissue for clients or process private label dbm products  we generate revenues by charging our customers a fee for our services 
throughout  we continued to influence favorably our gross margins by accelerating the development of new products  increasing our inventory velocity by re aligning our work in process and finished goods tissue inventories  reducing costs  and increasing processing efficiencies by reducing lead times  improving tissue yields and reducing our obsolescence exposure 
we expect to continue these efforts in future periods 
we remained profitable in increasing net income to million or 
diluted earnings per share from net income million or 
diluted earnings per share in we realized revenue of million  a gain over revenues and improved gross margin to in from in we generated positive cash flow of million in increasing our available cash position to million at december  in  we anticipate additional improvements in profitability on increased revenue while maintaining our current gross margin levels 
we intend to invest in operational improvements  plant expansion for our new products and a new computer software system in  and continue to improve our cash available reserves from cash flow generated from operations

diluted earnings per share and resulted from increased revenue and improved gross margins which was partially offset by higher operating expenses as compared to our investment in distribution effectiveness initiatives  the costs associated with the settlement of certain litigation  and the non cash compensation costs related to grants of equity awards contributed to the increase in operating expenses 
net income for the year ended december  was million or 
diluted earnings per share and resulted primarily from improved gross margins and reductions in operating expenses as compared to the same respective period in we incurred a net loss in of million or diluted loss per share due primarily to costs incurred to implement our strategic initiatives to re align our work in process and finished goods tissue inventories  which negatively impacted our gross margins  increased operating expenses including charges for the retirement and resignation of three former 
table of contents executive officers  foreign currency translation losses on intercompany debt and an income tax benefit on our operating loss at an effective tax rate substantially lower than the statutory rate 
revenue for the year ended december   revenue increased to million as compared to revenue of million 
revenue increased principally from increased unit sales volume in our dbm  hybrid synthetic and traditional tissue product lines 
we recognized revenue declines from the distribution of our graftech bio implants and from fees associated with our processing of donors for mtf 
revenue increased in to million as compared to revenue of million principally from increased unit sales volume in our dbm and traditional tissue segments 
the following table details the components of our revenues for the years presented percent change year ended december  vs 
vs 
in thousands dbm segment traditional tissue segment spinal allograft segment hybrid synthetic segment client services segment other product lines compared to the products in the dbm and hybrid synthetic segments compose our core products and are designated as such because they are the focus of our research and development initiatives and we believe they offer us the highest potential for revenue growth and profitability improvement 
we anticipate that our strategic efforts will be focused on expanding domestic and international markets for our current core products as well as the new products we are and will be developing 
dbm segment revenue  which consists of grafton dbm revenue  revenue from the xpanse bone inserts and revenue from the processing of two private label dbms  increased in as compared to primarily as a result of increased unit volumes 
revenue from grafton dbm  private label dbm tissue forms and xpanse bone inserts increased  and  respectively  in compared to revenue in the hybrid synthetic segment represented sales of our plexur p biocomposite and graftcage spacers 
the plexur p biocomposite contributed million to revenue growth for the year ended december  revenue from the graftcage spacers was 
million in and we do not anticipate revenue from the distribution of the graftcage spacers to be a significant contributor to our future revenue streams 

table of contents traditional tissue segment revenue from the worldwide distribution of allograft bone tissue grafts increased in the year ended december  from the prior year 
the increase in traditional tissue revenues resulted from increases in domestic and international unit sales partially offset by declines in domestic pricing 
in  we expect to continue to expand our international traditional tissue business over levels  but expect our domestic traditional tissue revenue to remain relatively flat 
revenue in the spinal allograft segment declined in the year ended december  compared to the same periods in primarily due to a decrease in unit sales volume 
we anticipate that our annual graftech bio implant revenue will decline slightly in from the levels realized in client service segment revenue generated by the processing of allograft bone tissue for our clients  mainly mtf  declined for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
we anticipate revenues in the client services segment will decline as we process fewer donors for mtf 
our contractual agreements with mtf will expire at the end of and  thereafter  we expect revenues in this segment to be an insignificant part of our revenue in compared to dbm segment revenue  which consists primarily of domestic and international grafton dbm revenue  revenue from the xpanse bone inserts and revenue from the processing of two private label dbms  increased in as compared to grafton dbm revenue increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  as a result of an increase in world wide unit sales volume  partially offset by a decline in average selling prices  principally in the domestic market  due to competitive pressures 
revenue from the shipment of private label dbm tissue forms increased in compared to  primarily due to increased unit volumes based on our partners sales levels to end users 
a portion of the increase in revenue was related to introduction of the xpanse bone insert in late  which contributed million to the revenue growth 
traditional tissue segment revenue from the world wide distribution of allograft bone tissue grafts increased in compared to the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in unit sales volume in all markets in which we distribute 
revenue in the spinal allograft segment is primarily driven by our domestic distribution of graftech bio implants 
our graftech bio implant business has been declining over the last several years due to increased competition and surgeon use of polymer based spinal interbody fusion devices 
in  revenue in the hybrid synthetic segment of million represented sales of our graftcage spacers  which were introduced in client service segment revenue generated by the processing of allograft bone tissue for our clients declined in as compared to primarily due to processing fewer donors for mtf 
other revenue  which primarily represent sales of xenograft tissue products processed at our facility in france  were relatively flat in compared to 
table of contents major customers in  and  mtf accounted for million  million and million of revenue  or  and  respectively  of consolidated revenue 
gross margin year ended december  in thousands gross profit gross margin in both and  gross margin increased over gross margin levels in the prior years  primarily due to the improvement in production volume to support the increase in unit sales volumes and our production initiatives  which has resulted in improved efficiencies and better utilization of allograft bone tissue 
in  we recognized charges of million related to reserves and write offs for excess  obsolete and expiring tissue inventories  primarily in the graftech bio implant product line  as a result of our standard inventory policies and procedures and to address our tissue inventory strategic intiatives 
operating expenses percent change year ended december  vs 
vs 
in thousands marketing  selling and general and administrative research development total in  marketing  selling and general and administrative expenses increased when compared to  principally due to our investment in improving worldwide distribution effectiveness  the costs associated with the settlement of certain litigation  the non cash compensation costs associated with our equity award programs and professional fees 
compensation expense related to our equity awards program was 
million and 
million in and  respectively 
we expect that marketing  selling and general and administrative expenses in will be slightly higher than such expense levels in due to continued distribution effectiveness initiatives and non cash compensation costs for our equity award programs 
research and development expenses in increased  primarily due to our focus on the development of new technologies and products 
we anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase in as we continue our current program efforts 
in  marketing  selling and general and administrative expenses declined when compared to  principally due to certain expense incurred in which did not recur in  and due to our efforts to control our operating costs  partially offset by accruals for management and employee bonuses 
in  we made certain investments of million to strengthen and diversify our domestic tissue sources  incurred severance and retirement costs of million associated with the retirement of our former chief executive officer and chief financial officer  the resignation of our former chief science officer and certain other employees terminated in the fourth quarter of  and incurred professional fees  including the

in  product segment operating income  as a percent of revenue  increased to compared to in costs and expenses associated with corporate increased in from the prior year  mainly due to non cash compensation costs for our equity award programs and higher professional fees 
we focused our efforts in  and will continue to do so in the future  on the core products in the dbm and hybrid synthetic segments 
in doing so  more resources are being allocated to these segments resulting in increased costs and expenses  which we anticipate will be offset by revenue increases as a result of our strategies and initiatives 
a portion of these costs and expenses had been reflected in the traditional tissue and client services segments in as a result of this reallocation of resources  costs and expenses in the traditional tissue and client services segments have declined 
we generated total product segment operating income of million in compared to million in  representing and of revenue  respectively 
the improvement in resulted from improved gross margins and a reduction in selling and marketing expenses as a result of reconfiguring the commission program 
costs and expenses related to corporate declined in the year ended december  when compared to as a result of various cost containment efforts

million  principally on intercompany debt  and  a 
million gain from a final contingent consideration payment related to the sale in of a foreign subsidiary 
other expense in of

million on invested cash balances  foreign currency translation gains of 
million  primarily related to intercompany debt  and a 
million gain from a contingent consideration payment related to the sale in of a foreign subsidiary 
in  other expense of million primarily represents interest expense of million related to long term debt  which was repaid in full in august  and the capital lease obligation  which arose in the sale and leaseback of our principal processing facility in august  and foreign currency translation losses of 
million primarily related to intercompany debt 
other expense was partially offset by interest income on available cash balance of 
million in in july  the board of directors declared million of intercompany indebtedness between the domestic company and its french subsidiary ost developpement sa ost to be permanent debt  requiring no principal repayments on such indebtedness 
the board of directors decision was based  in part  upon the need to provide ost with working capital to allow for the expansion of our international operations 
beginning in late and progressing through much of  we reorganized our international operations  which reduced ost s need for working capital support 
as a result  effective november   the board of directors declared that this million of intercompany debt would need to be repaid 
at december   all intercompany debt  in a net amount of million  is subject to the recognition of variations in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
it is anticipated that a significant portion of the aggregate amount of outstanding intercompany debt will be settled in future translation gains and losses may have a material impact on our results of operations in the event of significant changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  although the impact of such gains and losses should not have any impact on consolidated cash flows 
income tax provision in  after the application of available net operating loss carryforwards  we provided for federal income taxes based on the alternative minimum tax method  as well as provided a provision for certain state and foreign taxes 
the carryforwards utilized for federal  state and foreign purposes carried full valuation allowances 
our state income tax benefit was primarily due to the reversal of certain domestic state tax reserves and the filing for a state tax refund related to a prior year  partially offset by a provision for minimum state taxes in certain jurisdictions 
we have evaluated the continuing need for our valuation allowances for our domestic and foreign deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of the financial 
table of contents accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  and we have determined based on our assessment that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of such valuation allowances 
as in and  we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of such valuation allowances 
we will continue to assess the need to maintain existing valuation allowances or to record additional valuation allowances based on facts and circumstances in each future period 
in  we provided an income tax benefit primarily due to the reversal of certain domestic state tax reserves  which were no longer required  partially offset by provisions for minimum state income taxes 
no provision for federal or foreign taxes has been recorded due to the availability of prior year net operating loss carryforwards  which carry a full valuation allowance  or due to recognizing a current year taxable loss for which any tax benefits or assets would be fully offset by the establishment of valuation allowances 
in  we provided a benefit for income taxes primarily for our ability to carryback our current year losses to prior tax years and obtain refunds and a non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance for all domestic and foreign deferred tax assets 
we file us  state  and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations 
the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal  foreign and most state authorities including  but not limited to  the united states  france  bulgaria and new jersey 
our through federal tax returns are currently under examination by the internal revenue service irs 
the irs has notified us that it is questioning certain tax deductions taken in related to the shutdown and abandonment of our former processing environment and challenging the depreciable life of certain assets 
we disagree with and intend to oppose the irs s proposed adjustments 
we do not expect there to be any material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
if we do not prevail on the matters challenged by the irs  our available net operating loss carryforwards  which are subject to full valuation allowances  would be reduced by approximately million 
based on the nature of the items challenged by the irs  such items would be deductible in future periods 
upon our adoption of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  effective january   we had no material liability for unrecognized tax benefits utbs 
the components of our utbs are substantially comprised of deferred tax assets which are subject to a full valuation allowance 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which either a receivable or a liability for a utb has been established  or are required to pay an amount or utilize nols to settle a tax liability  or estimates regarding a utb change  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial reporting period may be affected 
as a result of changes in utbs during the year  at december   we had gross utbs of million 
at december   the reduction in net federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets by million as a result of utbs was offset by a similar change in the related valuation allowance 
we expect that the amount will change in the next twelve months due to our filing of amended federal and state tax returns  which could result in refunds of approximately 
million  
table of contents and expiring statutes of limitation and audit activity 
however  we do not anticipate the change to be significant 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  working capital increased to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the operating cash flow was generated from free cash flow net income plus non cash items  partially offset by changes in working capital 
net cash of million used in investing activities in was principally used to fund capital expenditures and intellectual property 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  which is principally used to fund capital expenditures 
we anticipate that capital expenditures and patent development funding to be approximately million 
in  net cash provided by financing activities of 
million resulted from proceeds of million generated from the issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options partially offset by principal payments of 
million on our capital lease obligation 
net cash used in financing activities of 
million in resulted from principal payments on our capital lease obligation of 
million offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 
million 
in february   we entered into a million line of credit with a banking institution 
we did not borrow any amounts under this facility and did not seek renewal of the line of credit at its expiration in february at december   we had aggregate federal net operating loss carryforwards and federal research and development and alternative minimum tax credits of million and 
million  respectively  which expire in varying amounts beginning in through at december   we had state net operating loss carryforwards of million 
state net operating loss carryforwards  which primarily offset new jersey taxable income  expire in varying amounts beginning in through in addition  we had state research and development  manufacturing and other credits of 
million primarily to offset new jersey income taxes  which expire in varying amounts beginning in through foreign net operating loss carryforwards aggregate million and expire in varying amounts beginning in in  the we wrote off certain of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million related to our inactive subsidiaries in the netherlands 
these foreign net operating loss carryforwards carried a full valuation allowance 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
less than years years after in thousands total one year years capital lease obligation non cancelable operating lease obligations retirement and severance payments asset retirement obligation shrewsbury facility asset retirement obligation eatontown facility reimbursement under tissue supply agreements represents the future value of the eatontown asset retirement obligation as of december  this asset retirement obligation will be accreted from its current value as of december  of million to its future value over the next eighteen years 
represents the minimum reimbursement to be made under our agreements with mtf  cts and lifenet for their services of donor recovery and donor eligibility related to the allograft bone tissue to be supplied to us over the current term of the related agreements 
based on our current projections and estimates  we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and anticipated future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our forecasted cash needs in our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our product development programs and the need and associated costs relating to regulatory approvals  if any  which may be needed to commercialize some of our products under development  and the resources we devote to the development  manufacture and marketing of our services and products 
we may seek additional funding to meet the needs of our long term strategic plans 
we can provide no assurance that such additional funds will be available or  if available  that such funds will be available on favorable terms 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we have not participated in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the 
table of contents estimates and may adjust them based upon the latest information available 
these estimates generally include those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories including purchase commitments  deferred processing costs including reserves for rework  excess and obsolescence  long lived assets  asset retirement obligations  income taxes  stock based compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated returns based upon historical experience 
if future returns are less than historical experience  reduction in estimated reserves would increase revenue 
alternatively  should returns exceed historical experience  additional allowances would be required  which would reduce revenue 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
changes in estimates of collection risk related to accounts receivable can result in decreases or increases in current period operating costs 
we write down inventory and deferred processing costs for estimated excess  obsolescence or unmarketable tissue grafts and products equal to the lower of cost or market value 
excess and obsolescence could occur from numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the competitive nature of the market  technological change  expiration and changes in surgeon preference 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required  including provisions to reduce inventory and deferred processing costs to net realizable value 
in each period  we also assess its production activity in relationship to historical experience and normal capacity  and evaluate the need to reflect processing costs as either period costs or as a component of deferred processing costs 
in periods where our actually process activities are less than historical experience  we charge an appropriate portion of our processing costs directly to cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we provide reserves  if any  for the difference between its contractual purchase commitments and its projected purchasing patterns based upon maintenance of adequate inventory levels and forecasted revenues 
if actual revenue is less favorable than those forecasted by management  additional reserves may be required  alternatively  if revenue is stronger than forecasted by management  such reserves would be reduced 
we record an asset retirement obligation when an obligation to retire an asset is determined 
the asset retirement obligation is accrued at its estimated fair value with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset  if appropriate 
we determine the amount of the asset retirement obligation based upon a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment and make adjustments to the asset retirement obligation recorded based on the passage of time or revisions to either the timing or the amount of the undiscounted cost estimate to retire the asset 

table of contents we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income  in the event that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we accrue current and future tax liabilities based upon levels of taxable income  tax planning strategies  and assessments of the timing of taxability of the tax attributes 
we provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected 
we measure stock based compensation cost at the date of grant  based on the fair value of the award  which is recognized as an expense generally on a straight line basis over the employee s or consultant s requisite service period with an equal amount recorded as additional paid in capital  net of income tax benefit  if any  until such time as the fair value has been fully recognized 
we account for forfeitures using an estimated rate when determining the fair value of the award 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and management is unable to predict the outcome of the pending litigation 
when we are reasonably able to determine the probable minimum or ultimate liability  if any  which may result from any of the pending litigation  we will record a provision for our best estimate of such liability  and if appropriate  will record a benefit for the amounts covered by insurance 
if the outcome or resolution of the pending litigation is for amounts greater than accrued  an expense will be recorded in the period the determination is made 
alternatively  should the outcome or resolution be for less than accrued  we would reduce the expense in the period the determination is made

impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of operations for the periods discussed have not been materially affected by inflation 
we are subject to foreign currency fluctuations for material changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
as our foreign source revenue continues to grow and represent a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues and profits  foreign currency translation adjustments may impact our operating results to a greater extent 
the exchange rate as of december  was us dollars to one euro compared to an exchange rate of us dollars to one euro as of december  the average exchange rate for the year ended december  was us dollars to one euro compared to an average exchange rate for the year ended december  of us dollars to one euro
