item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have restated our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended april  and  as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item note details the impact of the restatement on our previously reported unaudited quarterly financial data for interim periods in and all affected amounts and period to period comparisons described herein have been restated accordingly 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k 
our md a includes the following major sections executive summary results of operations 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies and estimates recently issued accounting pronouncements factors affecting future operating results executive summary our objective is to deliver profitable dynamic growth by providing technologically advanced waterjet cutting and cleaning systems to our customers 
to achieve this objective  we offer versatile waterjet cutting and industrial cleaning systems and we strive to expand market share in our current markets  continue to identify and penetrate new markets  capitalize on the our customer relationships and business competencies  develop and market innovative products and applications  and continue to improve operating margins by focusing on operational improvements 
our ability to fully implement our strategies and achieve our objective may be influenced by a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
refer to discussion under item a risk factors 
certain factors may cause our results to vary year over year 
for the three years ended april   we have identified such factors as follows introduction of new products in fiscal year  we introduced the  psi intensifier pump at the bi annual international manufacturing technology show imts in september in fiscal year  we introduced the nanojet tm system 
this system was used in the semiconductor industry to cut flash memory chips and contributed to  and of sales in the asia waterjet segment sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our  psi husky pump used in cleaning applications and our stonecrafter tm machine were also introduced in fiscal year intercompany transfer pricing policy we updated our intercompany transfer pricing policy effective august  to ensure that transactions among our various subsidiaries involved in various aspects of our business were made on arm s length terms 
while the application of our new intercompany transfer pricing policy did not change our revenue or operating performance on a consolidated basis  it impacted the allocation of operating profit amongst our segments 
the impact of the new transfer pricing methodology on segment revenues and operating performance will be discussed in the comparative discussion of fiscal year to fiscal year results of operations 
allocation of corporate management fees during fiscal year  we have allocated corporate management fees in total of million from north america waterjet to the company s other operating segments which is part of the reports evaluated by the chief operating decision maker during the current fiscal year 
fiscal year has been recast to reflect this methodology 
we have not recast the results of operations of fiscal year as doing so would not be practical 

table of contents exit or disposal activities in april  we decided to sell our cis technical solutions division cis division  which was previously reported as part of our applications segment 
accordingly  we have recast all periods presented to reflect the results of operating this division in discontinued operations 
operating income for this division totaled   and  for the years ended april   and  respectively 
on june   we committed to a plan to establish a single facility for designing and building our advanced waterjet systems at our jeffersonville  indiana facility and to close our manufacturing facility in burlington  ontario  canada 
we estimate that the costs associated with the closure of the burlington facility and the costs associated with moving production to our jeffersonville facility will range from million to million in fiscal  including from million to million for severance and termination benefits and million to million for facility closure and relocation costs 
based on our plans to close our burlington  ontario manufacturing facility we recorded an impairment charge of  related to the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
results of operations summary consolidated results for fiscal years   and year ended april  change change versus versus in thousands  except per share amounts sales operating income year ended april  change change versus versus in thousands  except per share amounts sales systems consumable parts total sales fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales growth of million or was primarily driven by increased adoption of waterjet cutting and cleaning technology in the global markets and increased sales of  psi systems 
the strengthening of the brazilian real versus the us dollar improved our competitive position in latin america markets 
excluding the impact of foreign currency changes  sales increased million or in total system sales were up million or

com has been deployed in europe for approximately two years 
operating income growth was primarily driven by the higher sales discussed above along with lower operating expenses related to the timing of new product launches 
in the prior year  we incurred expenses related to new core product development such as stonecrafter tm  the  psi pump and the  psi husky 
additionally  there were lower professional fees for legal  audit  and consulting fees for assistance with sarbanes oxley compliance during the current fiscal year 

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales growth was due to management s focus on the core of our business ultrahigh pressure water pumps and the applications that integrate these pumps to cut and clean material 
improved global awareness of the benefits of waterjet cutting and cleaning technology over other traditional methods has resulted in increased global adoption of waterjet cutting and cleaning technology across multiple industries 
operating income in fiscal year was negatively impacted by increased material and warranty costs  and the compensation expense incurred to amend the former ceo s employment contract 
additionally  fiscal year operating expenses included legal  consulting fees  and losses totaling million related to the asia investigations which were discussed in previous filings 
these investigations related to irregularities discovered in our taiwan and korean operations 
in response to the investigations findings  we developed a remediation plan which has been implemented by senior management with the advice and counsel of the audit committee and its advisors 
the remediation plan involved rebuilding the flow asia organization  including actions to assure clear and comprehensive policies  establish and communicate behavior standards and assure appropriate tone at the top

a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the period in which the tax benefit will be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the tax benefit will be realized 
in determining the realizability of these assets  we considered numerous factors  including historical profitability  estimated future taxable income and the industry in which we operate 
based on the cumulative results of operations in the united states for the fiscal years ended april    and and anticipated future profit levels  we believe that certain of our deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized

critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our assumptions  estimates  and judgment on historical experience  current trends and other factors which management believes to be relevant and appropriate at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates  and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly 
however  because future events cannot be determined with certainty  actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note the company and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the following accounting estimates require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for sales of ultrahigh pressure waterjet pumps  consumables  services  and billing for freight charges  in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements and eitf issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  because flowmaster tm software  our pc based waterjet control  is essential to the functionality of our waterjet systems  we recognize revenue on sales of waterjet systems in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
specifically  the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured  or probable in the case of sale of waterjet systems 
generally  sales revenue is recognized at the time of shipment  receipt by customer  or  if applicable  upon completion of customer acceptance provisions 
unearned revenue is recorded for products or services that have not been provided but have been invoiced under contractual agreements or paid for by a customer  or when products or services have been provided but all the criteria for revenue recognition have not been met 
for those arrangements with multiple elements  the arrangement is divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is vendor specific objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
for contract arrangements that combine deliverables such as systems with embedded software  and installation  each deliverable is generally considered a separate unit of accounting or element 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
the amount 
table of contents allocable to a delivered item is limited to the amount that we are entitled to bill and collect and is not contingent upon the delivery performance of additional items 
in cases where there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item in an arrangement but no such evidence for the delivered item  the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
for complex aerospace and automation systems designed and manufactured to buyers specification  the company recognizes revenues using the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
typical lead times can range from two to months 
sales and profits on such contracts are recorded based on the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to the total estimated costs for each contract the cost to cost method 
losses on contracts are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
the impact of revisions of contract estimates is recognized as a cumulative change in estimate in the period in which the revisions are made 
the complexity of the estimation process and judgments related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization  changes to specification and testing requirements and collectibility of unbilled receivables 
significant management judgments and estimates are made in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
we must assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable  whether or not collection is probable  whether vsoe exists for all elements of a transaction or multiple element arrangement and the related revenue recognition impact of this and  for fixed price contracts  make estimates of costs to complete 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of revenues for any period if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
valuation of obsolete excess inventory we currently write down obsolete or excess parts and equipment inventory that is no longer used due to design changes to our products or lack of customer demand 
we regularly monitor our inventory levels and  if we identify an excess condition based on our usage  we record a corresponding inventory reserve which establishes a new cost basis for our inventory 
subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis 
the amount of inventory write down requires the use of management judgment regarding technological obsolescence and forecasted customer demand 
if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step is only addressed if step has been satisfied 
under step  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement 
as used in fin  the term more likely than not means that the likelihood of an occurrence is greater than 
we adopted fin as of may  to the extent that we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefits have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our unrecognized tax benefits  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require the use of our cash and would result in an increase to 
table of contents our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
our annual effective tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating tax positions 
tax positions are reviewed quarterly and balances are adjusted as new information becomes available 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
these assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
future tax benefits of tax losses and credit carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
as of april   we had approximately million of domestic net operating loss and million of state net operating loss carryforwards to offset certain earnings for federal and state income tax purposes 
these net operating loss carryforwards expire between fiscal year and fiscal year net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions amount to million 
most of the foreign net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely  with certain amounts expiring between fiscal years and the federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards per the income tax returns filed include uncertain tax positions taken in prior years 
due to the application of fin  the net operating loss carryforwards per the income tax returns are larger than the net operating loss deferred tax asset recognized for consolidated financial statement purposes 
we also have a capital loss carryover of million which expires in utilization of net operating losses may be subject to limitation due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
if such a limitation applies  the net operating loss may expire before full utilization 
our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our filing tax positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
long lived assets and goodwill goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
our annual testing date is april we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  an implied fair value for goodwill is estimated  based on the fair value of the operations  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
in determining fair value of long lived assets and whether impairment has occurred  we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values 
key assumptions we use in developing these estimates include probability of alternative outcomes  product pricing  product sales  and discount rate 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of long lived assets and goodwill 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
stock based compensation we have a stock based compensation plan  which provides for the grant of stock options and restricted stock units 
refer to note the company and summary of significant accounting policies  and 
table of contents note stock based compensation of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
we determine the fair value of our stock option awards at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
we determine cumulative expense related to performance based nonvested awards based on our actual consolidated financial results to date and estimated future performance as of period end 
legal contingencies at any time  we may be involved in certain legal proceedings 
our policy is to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience 
we record reserves related to certain legal matters for which it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be estimated 
with respect to other matters  management has concluded that a loss is only reasonably possible or remote and  therefore  no liability is recorded 
management discloses the facts regarding material matters assessed as reasonably possible and potential exposure  if determinable 
costs incurred with defending claims are expensed as incurred 
as of april   we have accrued our estimate of the probable liabilities for the settlement of these claims 
refer to note commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters  we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates 
such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements is in note recently issued accounting pronouncements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting future operating results looking forward to fiscal year  we believe we are well positioned for continued success and profitable growth especially as our  psi product line continues to be positively received by the market 
however  this positive market reception will be negatively impacted by the economic slowdown in north america which could also impact other markets around the world 
the anticipated continued strength of foreign currencies against the us dollar  particularly the euro and real  is expected to positively impact our business 
recent contract awards for large aerospace programs are also expected to positively impact our sales to the aerospace industry over the next two years 
our manufacturing operations are prepared to take advantage of volume leverage and opportunities for cost reduction 
on june   we committed to a plan to establish a single facility for designing and building our advanced waterjet systems at our jeffersonville  indiana facility and to close our manufacturing facility in burlington  ontario  canada 
we estimate that the costs associated with the closure of the burlington facility and the costs associated with moving production to its jeffersonville facility will range from million to million in fiscal year  including from million to million for severance and termination benefits and million to million for facility closure and relocation costs 
in fiscal year and beyond  we intend to remain focused on our strategies of increasing market awareness of waterjet technology to drive increased market penetration and to improve our operational efficiency 
we expect that these strategies and actions taken will help us achieve our long term goals of compound annual revenue growth rate of and operating income annual growth rate of at least 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exists in our financial instruments related to an increase in interest rates  adverse changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar  as well as financial risk management and derivatives 
these exposures are related to our daily operations 
interest rate exposure at april   we had million in interest bearing debt and notes payable 
of this amount  million was variable rate debt with an interest rate of per annum as of april  and million was related to notes payable at fixed interest rates ranging from to as of april  see note long term obligations and notes payable of the consolidated financial statements for additional contractual information on our long term obligations and notes payable 
market risk is estimated as the potential for interest rates to increase on the variable rate debt 
a change in variable interest rates would impact the interest expense in fiscal by approximately  based on the debt balance and interest rate as of april  at april   we had no derivative instruments to offset the risk of interest rate changes 
we may choose to use derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage the risk associated with interest rate changes in future periods 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in a number of countries around the world and as a result are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
costs in some countries are incurred  in part  in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 
our non us operations account for approximately of consolidated revenue 
based on our results for the year ended april  for our foreign subsidiaries  and based on the net position of foreign assets less liabilities  a hypothetical near term appreciation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies in the countries in which we operate in could positively impact operating income expense and other income expense by  and  respectively 
conversely  a hypothetical devaluation of the us dollar against all foreign currencies in the countries in which we operate in could negatively impact operating income expense and other income expense by  and  respectively 
our consolidated financial position and cash flows could be similarly impacted 
we selectively utilize forward exchange rate contracts which we have not designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the adverse effect exchange rate fluctuations may have on foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable both trade and inter company 
at april   we marked these forward contracts to market  recording a net loss of approximately  as a component of net income for the year ended april  we may continue to utilize forward exchange rate contracts and other derivative instruments in the future to manage the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes
