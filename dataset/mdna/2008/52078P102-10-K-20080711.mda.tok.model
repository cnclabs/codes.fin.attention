other trademarks and trade names appearing in this document are the property of their respective holders 
intellectual property and product liability we regard certain aspects of our internal operations  software and documentation as proprietary  and rely on a combination of contract  copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws and other measures  including confidentiality agreements  to protect our proprietary information 
existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
we believe that  because of the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry  trade secret and copyright protection is less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of our employees  frequent software product enhancements  and the timeliness and quality of support services 
we cannot guarantee that these protections will be adequate  or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
historically  we have provided our customers source code for many of our products 
we may elect to distribute only object code in the future 
in either case  we will permit customers to obtain access to our other source code through a source code escrow arrangement 
access to our source code may increase the likelihood of misappropriation or other misuse of our intellectual property 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our software products are  or may be licensed  do not protect our software products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and sweden 
software companies have increasingly applied for  and relied on  the protection of patents 
to date  we hold two united states patents and have filed several patent applications 
these applications may not result in issued patents and  even if issued will not provide assurance of a competitive advantage 
we do not believe our software products  third party software products we offer under sublicense agreements  our trademarks  or other lawson proprietary rights infringe the property rights of third parties 
however  we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us with respect to current or future software products or that any such assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
under the license agreements with our customers  we agree to indemnify our customers for third party claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of those third parties 
we are also exposed to product liability risks under applicable country and state laws 
we generally attempt to limit our exposure to product liability claims with customers as part of our license agreements 
however  local laws or unfavorable judicial decisions might diminish or invalidate the scope of these limitations 
employees as of may   we had approximately  employees  including approximately in sales and marketing  approximately in research and development  approximately  in services and customer support and approximately in administration 
none of our employees in the us are represented by a labor union  however  in certain international subsidiaries workers councils represent our employees

risk factors factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous uncertainties and risks 
investors evaluating our company and our business should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report on form k 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report 
any of the following factors could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition and or negatively affect our stock price 
additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may make forward looking statements from time to time  both written and oral 
we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements based on circumstances or events which occur in the future 
the actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this report 
the enterprise software business is highly competitive 
we compete with oracle corporation  sap ag  infor global solutions  inc  microsoft corporation  mckesson corporation and other larger software companies that have advantages over us due to their larger customer bases  greater name recognition  long operating and product development history  greater international presence and substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
if customers or prospects want to reduce the number of their software vendors  they may elect to purchase competing products from oracle  sap  infor or microsoft since those larger vendors offer a wider range of products 
furthermore  oracle is capable of bundling its software with its database applications  which underlie a significant portion of our installed applications 
we also compete with a variety of more specialized software and services vendors  including single industry software vendors  human resource management software vendors  financial management software vendors  manufacturing software vendors  merchandising software vendors  services automation software vendors  software integrators and outsourced services providers  and internet on demand software vendors 
we believe that oracle  sap and other competitors are discounting their products and services on an increasing basis to attempt to gain market share in the markets where we compete 
some competitors are also increasingly aggressive with offering payment terms  contractual warranties  implementation terms or guarantees that are more favorable to customers and prospects 
competitors may entice our customers and prospects to switch software vendors by offering those customers or prospects free or heavily discounted products or services  and other more favorable contract terms 
we may be unable to continue to compete successfully with new and existing competitors without lowering prices or offering other favorable terms to customers that lower our margins and increase our risks 
we expect competition to persist and intensify  which could negatively impact our operating results and market share 
economic  political and market conditions  can adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results 
our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for enterprise software and related maintenance and services  particularly in the industries and geographies in which we sell our products and services 
demand for enterprise software and demand for our solutions are affected by general economic conditions  competition  product acceptance and technology lifecycles 
regional and global changes in the economy  governmental budget deficits and political instability in certain geographic areas have resulted in businesses  government agencies and educational institutions reducing their spending for technology projects generally and delaying or reconsidering potential purchases of our products and related services 
the uncertainty posed by the long term effects of escalating oil prices  the global economic slowdown  continuation of the global credit crisis  the war in the middle east  terrorist activities  potential pandemics  natural disasters and related uncertainties and risks and other geopolitical issues may impact the purchasing decisions of current or potential customers 
because of these factors  we believe the level of demand for our products and services  and projections of future revenue and operating results  will continue to be difficult to predict 
these geopolitical risks could also impede employee travel and our business operations in any affected regions 
our revenues  and in particular our software license revenues  vary each quarter and are difficult to predict 
revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our licensing activity with new and existing customers  and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter under our revenue recognition policies 
if we do not continue to develop or acquire new products  licensing activity with existing customers will decline 
licensing activity for our products drives maintenance and services revenues because we sell maintenance and services for only our products 
a decrease in licensing activity will typically lead to a decrease in services revenue in the same or subsequent quarters 
if we do not have sufficient licensing activity with new customers each year  our maintenance revenue for the following year will decline because new customers are needed to offset the percentage of existing customers who scale back their businesses  reduce licenses and maintenance contracts  are acquired  or otherwise choose not to renew annual maintenance 
our sales force and marketing team must continue to generate sales leads among existing customers and prospective customers 
when we qualify a lead  that lead becomes part of our sales pipeline 
if our pipeline does not continue to grow in our different markets and geographies  our revenues will eventually decline 
the rate at which we convert our pipeline into actual sales can vary greatly from year to year for the following reasons the period between initial customer contact and a purchase by a customer may vary and can be more than one year 
during the sales cycle  prospective customers may decide not to purchase or may scale down purchases because of competing offers  budgetary constraints or changes in the prospect s management  strategy  business or industry 
increasingly  customer or prospect organizations are taking more steps to approve the purchase of our products and services 
often times  we must wait for a customer or prospect s board of directors to approve a purchase 
these added approval requirements can delay the sales cycle and jeopardize the likelihood of completing the sale 
a substantial number of our existing and prospective customers make their purchase decision within the last few weeks or days of each quarter 
a delay or deferral in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause our quarterly license revenue to fall significantly short of our predictions 
prospective customers may decline or defer the purchase of new products if we do not have sufficient customer references for those products 
new products or technologies  software industry mergers and other software industry news may create uncertainty and cause customers and prospective customers to cancel  postpone or reduce capital spending for our products 
because a substantial portion of our software license revenue contracts are completed in the latter part of a quarter  and our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term  unexpected revenue shortfalls and deferrals have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability 
we may not retain or attract customers if we do not develop new products and enhance our current products in response to technological changes and competing products 
the enterprise software market is faced with rapid technological change  evolving standards in computer hardware  software development and communications and security infrastructure  and changing needs and expectations of customers 
building new products and service offerings requires significant investment in development 
a substantial portion of our research and development resources are devoted to regulatory and maintenance requirements and product upgrades that address new technology support 
these demands put significant constraints on our resources available for new product development 
we also face uncertainty when we develop or acquire new products because there is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop for those products 
we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments  and any acquisitions and investments we do complete may create business difficulties or dilute earnings 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions in the future 
we may be unable to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates 
even if we identify suitable candidates  we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms 
if we acquire a company  we may incur losses in the operations of that company and we may have difficulty integrating its products  personnel and or operations into our business 
in addition  its key personnel may decide not to work for us 
these difficulties could disrupt our on going business  distract our management and workforce  increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results 
we may also incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business 
furthermore  we may incur significant debt or issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments 
the issuance of equity securities may be dilutive to our stockholders 
if the products of an acquired company are not successful  those remaining assets could become impaired  which may result in an impairment loss that could materially adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
a significant portion of our future revenue is dependent upon our existing installed base of customers continuing to license additional products  as well as purchasing consulting services and renewing their annual maintenance agreements 
if our existing customers fail to renew their maintenance agreements or elect not to purchase new products or additional services from us at historical levels  our revenues and results of operations could be materially impacted 
competitors may take advantage of our limited intellectual property protection 
we consider certain aspects of our internal operations  software and documentation to be proprietary  and rely on a combination of contract  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect this information 
in addition  we currently hold two patents in the u 
s 
and have filed several patent applications 
outstanding applications may not result in issued patents and  even if issued  the patents may not provide any competitive advantage 
copyright laws afford only limited protection because those laws do not protect product ideas 
in addition  when we license our products to customers  we provide source code for many of our products 
customers may also access source code through a source code escrow arrangement 
access to our source code could provide an opportunity for companies to offer competing maintenance and product modification services to our customers 
defending our intellectual property rights is time consuming and costly 
deterioration in our relationships with resellers  systems integrators and other third parties that market and sell our products could reduce our revenues 
our revenue growth will depend  in part  on adding new partners to expand our sales channels  as well as leveraging our relationships with existing partners 
if our relationships with these resellers  system integrators and strategic and technology partners deteriorate or terminate  we may lose sales and marketing opportunities 
some current and potential customers rely on third party systems integrators to implement and manage new and existing applications 
these systems integrators may increase their promotion of competing enterprise software applications  or may otherwise discontinue their relationships with us 
we also license third party software products that we incorporate into  or resell with  our own software products 
for example  we incorporate micro focus international  inc s software in many of our products and have reseller and alliance relationships with ibm  business software incorporated  business objects and other businesses that allow us to resell their offerings with our products and services 
these relationships and other technology licenses are subject to periodic renewal and may include minimum sales requirements 
a failure to renew or early termination of these relationships or other technology licenses could adversely impact our business 
charges to earnings resulting from past acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results 
under purchase accounting  we allocate the total purchase price to an acquired company s net tangible assets  intangible assets and in process research and development based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition and record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain 
going forward  the following factors could result in material charges that would adversely affect our results impairment of goodwill or intangible assets  identification of assumed contingent liabilities subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation  charges to income to eliminate certain lawson pre merger activities that duplicate those of the acquired company or to reduce our cost structure  or international sales and operations subject us to risks that can adversely affect our operating results 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues  and have significant operations  outside of the us our international operations include software development  sales  customer support and administration 
we face challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries  which can entail longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  overlapping tax regimes  difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
we must comply with a variety of international laws and regulations  including trade restrictions  local labor ordinances  and import and export requirements 
we may experience foreign currency gains and losses 
we conduct a significant portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
our revenues and operating results are affected when the dollar strengthens or weakens relative to other 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies  particularly the euro  swedish krona and british pound relative to the us dollar can significantly affect our revenues and operating results 
recognized balance sheet exposures are partially offset by forward currency contracts 
net foreign currency transaction gains and losses  resulting primarily from recognized balance sheet exposures  are recorded within earnings in the period incurred 
litigation may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business and industry throughout the world 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and the risk of litigation by employees  customers  suppliers  stockholders or others through private actions  class actions  administrative proceedings or other litigation 
litigation can be lengthy  expensive  and disruptive to our operations and results cannot be predicted with certainty 
there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation  regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 
as a result  litigation may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
others may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
many participants in the technology industry have an increasing number of patents and have frequently demonstrated a readiness to take legal action based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement 
these types of claims are time consuming and costly to defend 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
our products are deployed in large and complex systems and may contain defects or security flaws 
because our products are deployed in large and complex systems  they can only be fully tested for reliability when deployed in networks for long periods of time 
our software programs may contain undetected defects when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our customers might encounter difficulties with the implementation of our products  discover defects in our products  experience corruption of their data or encounter performance or scaling problems only after our software programs have been deployed 
as a consequence  from time to time we have received customer complaints or been sued 
in addition  our products are combined with products from other vendors 
as a result  should problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
software and data security are becoming increasingly important because of regulatory restrictions on data privacy and the significant legal exposures and business disruptions stemming from computer viruses and other unauthorized entry or use of computer systems 
we may not be able to avoid or limit liability for disputes relating to product performance  software security or the provision of services 
product defects and security flaws could expose us to product liability and warranty claims and harm our reputation  which could impact our future sales of products and services 
open source software may diminish our license fees and impair the ownership of our products 
the open source community is comprised of many different formal and informal groups of companies  software developers and individuals who have created a wide variety of software and have made that software available for use  distribution and modification  often free of charge 
open source software  such as the linux operating system  has been gaining in popularity among business users 
if developers contribute enterprise application software to the open source community  and that software has competitive features and scale to business users in our markets  we will need to change our product pricing and distribution strategy to compete 
if one of our developers embedded open source components into one of our products  without our knowledge or authorization  our ownership and licensing of that product could be in jeopardy 
depending on the open source license terms  the use of an open source component could mean that all products delivered with that open source component become part of the open source community 
in that case  we would not own those delivered products and could not charge license fees for those products 
we currently take steps to train our developers and monitor the content of products in development  but there is no assurance that these steps will always be effective 
our profit margin for consulting services is lower than margins related to the other aspects of our business 
the consulting part of our business is highly competitive  is less proprietary  and industry wide carries a much lower gross margin than the other aspects of our business 
for fiscal  consulting services represented approximately of our total revenues 
since our acquisition of intentia in april  we have taken measures to improve our profit margin for consulting services  including improving utilization of services personnel and moving portions of our consulting services to our lower cost operations in manila  philippines 
we have experienced margin improvements over the past two fiscal years and expect to make continued improvements going forward 
however  our consulting services business is highly sensitive to customer demands  competitive pressures and other external and internal forces 
our actions to improve our consulting services margin may be offset by these forces which could negatively impact our operating results 
we have started to deliver our strategic human capital management solution through software as a service saas  which may adversely affect our operating profit margins because the saas license and delivery model differs substantially from our traditional business practices 
traditionally  we have licensed and delivered our products to customers under a perpetual license  with the customer being responsible for obtaining and operating the computer hardware for that software 
we have begun to offer our strategic human capital management solution through saas  and might add additional saas offerings in the future 
for each saas offering  we license the software under a term license and are responsible for the hosting and maintenance of that software on the computer hardware 
the customer accesses  on a remote basis  the saas software from our data center administered by a third party firm 
selling  servicing and supporting saas customers is substantially different than our traditional perpetual licenses  which can increase our costs and fulfillment risks 
we have recently completed the remediation of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of that was reported from the first quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal however  situations could arise in the future that could result in the assessment of a future material weakness 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the lack of a sufficient number of qualified accounting personnel with the required proficiency to apply our accounting policies in accordance with us gaap 
this material weakness became evident pursuant to our acquisition and integration of intentia 
through hiring and training efforts we have significantly improved our internal control over financial reporting including an increase in the number of qualified accounting personnel with the required proficiency to apply our accounting policies in accordance with us gaap 
as a result  we have remediated the previously reported material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of may  situations could arise in the future including but not limited to a a significant acquisition s  b a major system implementation  or c significant turnover of key finance and or accounting personnel which could result in the occurrence of internal control deficiencies that may be determined to be a material weakness 
the existence of a material weakness could increase the risk that our consolidated financial statements may not fairly present  in all material respects  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented and may lead to delays in our ability to complete our financial reporting on a timely basis 
we must attract and retain account executives in our sales organization to achieve our revenue goals 
revenue growth  and in particular software license revenue growth  requires that we have a sufficient number of trained account executives in our sales organization to develop leads and call on prospective customers 
competition in our industry for experienced account executives is intense 
competitors and other software companies may lure away our account executives through signing bonuses and other special incentives 
the failure to attract and retain account executives will negatively impact our revenue growth 
when we hire a new account executive  the time period required for that person to become productive will vary  depending on their experience and training and the customer pipeline and length of sales cycle 
if we are unable to attract and retain senior management  software developers  services consultants  finance and accounting specialists  and other qualified personnel  we will be unable to develop new products and increase our revenue and profitability 
we also rely on the continued service of our senior management  software developers  services consultants  finance and accounting specialists  and other key employees 
in the software industry  there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business  product development  technical  financial and other personnel 
the failure to attract  train  retain and effectively manage employees could negatively impact our development and efforts and cause a degradation of our customer service 
if we are unable to attract and retain finance and accounting personnel who have experience with the software industry and u 
s 
accounting requirements  we will have to continue to rely on more costly contractors to fill the roles necessary for us to meet our governance and regulatory requirements 
we are required to delay revenue recognition into future periods for portions of our license fee activity 
our entire worldwide business is subject to united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
under those rules  we are required to defer revenue recognition for license fees in situations that include the following the customer agreement includes products that are under development or has other undelivered elements  the customer agreement includes essential services  including significant modifications  customization or complex interfaces this is more prevalent with our m products  the customer agreement includes acceptance criteria  the customer agreement includes extended or contingent payment terms or fees  a third party vendor  whose technology is incorporated into our products  delays delivery of its product to the customer  the customer agreement includes a fixed fee service arrangement for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  or we are not able to establish historical pricing and maintenance renewal rates to meet the vsoe requirements of these accounting rules 
we expect that we will continue to defer recognition of portions of our license fee activity in each period because of these factors  with deferrals more likely for a our m products because of product customization often required due to the nature of the manufacturing and distribution industries that is frequently included with new sales  b sales to governmental entities because those often include fixed fee arrangements for which we do not have vsoe of fair value  and c sales of large license fee contracts because it is more difficult to use standard contract terms 
the amount of license fees deferred may be significant and will vary each quarter  depending on the mix of products sold in each market and geography  and the actual contract terms 
we may take additional restructuring actions that result in financial charges in the period taken 
since our acquisition of intentia in april  we have been integrating our two companies and executing on our business plan 
we have consolidated lawson and intentia facilities and taken other restructuring actions to reduce combined company costs 
we have continued to expand our operations in the philippines  reducing certain higher cost employee positions in the united states and europe 
if we decide to take additional restructuring actions to improve our operational efficiencies  we may be required to incur financial charges in the period when we make such decisions  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for that period 
we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities 
as a multinational organization  we are subject to income taxes as well as non income based taxes  in both the us as well as in various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we are also subject to non income taxes  such as payroll  sales  use  value added  net worth  property and goods and services taxes  both in the us and various foreign jurisdictions 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non income taxes and may have additional exposure to additional non income tax liabilities 
our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate  which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 
we have had an unusually high effective tax rate and are taking steps to bring our effective tax rate more in line with our industry 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful because our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control  including changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates  changing tax laws  regulations  and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  changes to the financial accounting rules for income taxes  unanticipated changes in tax rates  changes in accounting and tax treatment of stock based compensation  the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods  changes to the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets  or the assessments  or any related tax interest or penalties  could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place 
we report our results of operations based on our determinations of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
periodically  we receive notices that a tax authority to which we are subject has determined that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority  and we regularly engage in discussions  and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities 
we are engaged in disputes of this nature from time to time 
if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for  our operating results  cash flows  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of lawson or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  our stockholder rights plan and delaware law could make it more difficult for other businesses to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain the following provisions  among others  which may inhibit an acquisition of our company by a third party advance notification procedures for matters to be brought before stockholder meetings  a limitation on who may call stockholder meetings  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent  and the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without a stockholder vote 
the issuance of stock under our stockholder rights plan could delay  deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder  meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder unless various conditions are met  such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors 
any of these restrictions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
control by existing shareholders could significantly influence matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of may   our executive officers  directors  and affiliated entities  in the aggregate  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
from time to time  hedge fund investors have accumulated large positions in our stock 
groups of stockholders  if acting together  would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations 
sale of a portion of these shares in the public market  or the perception that such sales are likely to occur  could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities

revenues for fiscal grew in all geographic regions as compared to fiscal the americas continue to represent approximately half of our total revenues for the year at 
the emea region accounted for of total revenues in the year and the remaining was in the asia pacific region including australia and new zealand 
revenues for fiscal reflected increases in nearly every product line 
gross margins were higher than last year reflecting the benefit of higher license revenues and improved consulting margins 
reduced operating expenses  as a percent of revenues  continue to contribute to our improved profitability 
increased sales and marketing expenses reflect our continued investment in new and existing customers and our commitment to growth 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to our investments in auction rate securities associated with the uncertainty in the credit markets and these investments exposure to the financial condition of bond insurance companies 
on july   we sold these securities for million  the carrying value as of may  the us dollar continued to weaken relative to other major international currencies in fiscal  when compared with rates in fiscal  contributing approximately million of the million year over year revenue growth  or of the total revenue growth 
the currency fluctuations also had the effect of increasing costs of revenues and expenses  as reported in us dollars  by approximately million in fiscal acquisitions we account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their estimated fair values at the effective date of the acquisitions and the results of operations have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition dates 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill recorded as a result of these acquisitions is subject to an annual impairment test and is not amortized 
these acquisitions are intended to enhance our focus on targeted vertical markets and to provide additional value added products and services to our customers 
see note  business combinations  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional information 
on april   we completed the acquisition of intentia 
we believe that the combination provides opportunities to leverage sales channels and sell expanded product lines across the combined business customer base 
the acquisition was accomplished through lawson s offer to exchange intentia s shares and warrants for newly issued shares of lawson common stock 
the total purchase price was million  which consisted of million for the fair value of our common stock issued in exchange for shares and warrants in intentia  million for the cash purchase of the remaining common stock of intentia  and million in cash for transaction costs 
in allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair values  we recorded approximately million of goodwill  million of identifiable intangible assets and million of deferred revenue 
these amounts and the net liabilities assumed of million as well as cash acquired of million equal the total purchase price of million 
we also completed a reorganization in connection with the combination 
on july   we acquired all of the outstanding equity of competency assessment solutions cas for million in cash 
the acquisition was completed to augment our human capital management solutions 
on december   we entered into a purchase agreement with sigma enterprise applications ab sigma whereby we acquired sigma s business pertaining to the maintenance and servicing of lawson s products for approximately million in cash  million of assumed liabilities and an additional contingent payment of million 
the acquisition was completed to augment sales of our s products in the nordic region 
on march   we acquired all the outstanding stock of visual advance systems technology vastech  a provider of workforce management software and services based in annapolis  maryland for million 
with this acquisition  we are now offering our customers  primarily in the healthcare and hospitality industries  an advanced workforce management staffing and scheduling solution to complement our lawson human capital management offerings 
on march   we acquired the product lifecycle management plm software division of san francisco based freeborders for million 
the addition of plm capabilities to our portfolio of enterprise software offerings will help our customers in the fashion industry establish processes that will enable them to cut the lead time from product concept to production to actual delivery to the retail store shelf 
outlook lawson s focus for fiscal is to deliver revenue and earnings growth over fiscal levels 
we expect to achieve overall revenue growth through continued increases in the productivity of our sales force combined with an anticipated increase in the number of quota carrying sales representatives by the end of the year 
within this overall revenue growth rate  we anticipate slowing the growth of our consulting services revenues to low single digits 
the reduction in the rate of services growth reflects management s plan to increase the amount of lawson implementation and consulting engagements performed by lawson partners and our team in manila 
we have largely completed the initial investment in our manila facility 
in fiscal  we will continue to make capital and expense investments in our it and financial system infrastructure 
these infrastructure investments will lead to marginally higher general and administrative expenses in fiscal overall  however  we expect to improve our gross and operating margins and improve our earnings per share in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented  as well as our disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  fair value of investments  fair value of stock based compensation  fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment  income taxes  restructuring obligations and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and assumptions on our historical experience and on various other information available to us at the time that these estimates and assumptions are made 
we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for our making judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies and reflect those areas that require more significant judgments  and use of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition rules for software businesses are very complex 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded 
however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from year to year 
the significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether collectability can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable 
in addition  our transactions often consist of multiple element arrangements  which typically include license fees  maintenance and support fees and consulting service fees 
these multiple element arrangements must be analyzed to determine the relative fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the aicpa  and in accordance with the sec accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide related consulting services  including training  and implementation services  as well as on going customer support and maintenance 
when our consulting  training and implementation services are not considered essential to the functionality of our software products  are sold separately and also are available from a number of third party service providers  our revenues from these services are generally recorded separately from license fees and recognized as the services are performed 
license fees within software arrangements including services that do not meet any one or a combination of the three criteria listed above  are recognized in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  using contract accounting and the percentage of completion methodology based on labor hours input 
software arrangements which include certain fixed fee service components are usually recognized as the services are performed while corresponding costs to provide these services are expensed as incurred 
from time to time  we enter into software arrangements that include software license  maintenance  and consulting services which are considered essential to the functionality of the software 
in these instances  we recognize revenue for the three revenue streams under two units of accounting  which are the i software license bundled together with consulting services and ii maintenance 
for purposes of displaying revenues  we present applicable license fees  maintenance and consulting revenues in our condensed consolidated statements of operations using vsoe or  if unavailable  other objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements and assigning the remainder of the arrangement fee to the license 
the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements may vary  due to the amount of judgment required to address significant assumptions  risks and uncertainties in applying the application of the percentage of completion methodology 
our specific revenue recognition policies are as follows software license fees license fee revenues from end users are recognized when the software product has been shipped  provided a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is considered probable 
provided the above criteria are met  license fee revenues from resellers are recognized when there is a sell through by a reseller to an end user 
a sell through is determined when we receive an order form from a reseller for a specific end user sale 
we do not generally offer rights of return  acceptance clauses or price protection to our customers 
in situations where software license contracts include rights of return or acceptance clauses  revenue is deferred until the clause expires 
typically  our software license fees are due within a month period from the date of shipment 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  or includes payment terms greater than twelve months from shipment  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple delivered elements such as software products or specified upgrades and undelivered elements such as support or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee according to the fair value of each element using vsoe 
vsoe of fair value is determined using the price charged when that element is sold separately 
in software arrangements in which we have fair value of all undelivered elements but not of a delivered element  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element and is recognized as revenue 
in software arrangements in which we do not have vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements  revenue is deferred until fair value is determined or all elements for which we do not have vsoe of fair value  have been delivered 
maintenance and support revenues from customer maintenance and support contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
revenues for maintenance and support that are bundled with license fees are deferred based on the vsoe of fair value of the bundled maintenance and support and recognized over the term of the agreement 
vsoe of fair value is based on the renewal rate for continued maintenance and support arrangements 
consulting services revenues from consulting services including training and implementation services are recognized as services are provided to customers 
revenues for consulting services that are bundled with license fees are deferred based on the vsoe of fair value of the bundled services and recognized when the services are performed 
vsoe of fair value is based on the price charged when training and consulting services are sold separately 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  the need for specific customer reserves and the aging of our receivables 
this provision is included in operating expenses as a general and administrative expense 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors 
if the factors utilized in determining the allowance do not reflect future performance  then a change in the allowance would be necessary in the period such determination is made which would affect future results of operations 
sales returns and allowances 
we do not generally provide a contractual right of return 
however  in the course of arriving at practical business solutions to various warranty and other claims  we have allowed sales returns and allowances 
we record a provision against revenue for estimated sales returns and allowances on licenses and consulting in the same period the related revenues are recorded or when current information indicates additional amounts are required 
these estimates are based on historical experience determined by analysis of return activities  specifically identified customers and other known factors 
if the historical data we utilize does not reflect expected future performance  a change in the allowances would be recorded in the period such determination is made affecting future results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
the majority of our intangible assets and goodwill resulted from our april acquisition of intentia 
we review identifiable intangible and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or a significant adverse change in the business climate in which we operate 
if such events or changes in circumstances are present  the undiscounted cash flows method is used to determine whether the long lived or intangible asset is impaired 
cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset  the asset is considered impaired  and the impairment is measured by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value using the discounted cash flows method 
the discount rate utilized is based on management s best estimate of the related risks and return at the time the impairment assessment is made 
on an annual basis or if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable  we review our recorded goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we operate as one reporting unit and therefore compare the carrying amount of our goodwill to our market value 
market value is determined utilizing our market capitalization plus a control premium 
if our market value exceeds our carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if our carrying amount exceeds our market value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is the new accounting basis 
a subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed and the loss has been recognized 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal  state  and foreign income taxes 
we operate in an international environment with significant operations in various locations outside of the united states 
accordingly  our consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in various locations and the applicable rates 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the provision for income tax take into account forecasted earnings  current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with preparing our global tax provision  we must assess temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of specific items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
as part of this process  we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and  based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance  if required 
the determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions  judgments  and estimates  including historical operating results  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period  except as discussed below for pre acquisition deferred tax assets that had a pre acquisition valuation allowance  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and related interpretations  future period reductions to the valuation allowance related to intentia s deferred tax assets that existed as of the date of the acquisition of intentia are first credited against goodwill  then to the other identifiable assets existing at the date of acquisition  and then  once these assets have been reduced to zero  credited to our income tax provision 
a provision benefit will not be realized for amounts credited against goodwill and other identifiable assets 
contingencies 
we may  from time to time  have unresolved regulatory  legal  tax or other matters see note  commitments and contingencies 
we provide for contingent liabilities in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies as amended sfas 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas  a loss contingency is charged to income when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure in the notes to the financial statements is required for loss contingencies that do not meet both conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
we expense all legal costs incurred to resolve regulatory  legal  tax  or other matters in the period incurred 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter to assess our potential financial exposure 
if a potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated as defined by sfas  we reflect the estimated loss in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available to us at that time 
further  estimates of this nature are highly subjective  and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates accordingly 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
litigation reserves 
the establishment of litigation reserves requires significant judgments concerning the ultimate outcome of pending litigation against us and our subsidiaries 
reserves established in the normal course of business are based on the application of sfas  which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an adverse outcome is probable and we are able to make a reasonable estimation of the probable loss 
reserves established in purchase accounting are based on fair value under sfas no 
 business combinations sfas so long as fair value can be determined within the purchase price allocation period  otherwise these are determined under sfas all such reserves exclude legal costs which are treated as period expenses when incurred 
litigation by its nature is uncertain and the determination of whether any particular case involves a probable loss and quantifying the amount of loss for purposes of establishing or adjusting applicable reserves requires us to exercise considerable judgment  which is applied as of a certain date 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new matters  developments in existing matters or if we determine to change our strategy with respect to the resolution of any particular matter 
see note  business combinations  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional information 
stock based compensation 
effective june   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which replaced sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and superseded accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under sfas r  stock based employee compensation cost is recognized using the fair value based method for all new awards granted after june  and unvested awards outstanding at june  compensation costs for unvested stock options and non vested awards that were outstanding at june   are being recognized over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of those options and awards as previously calculated under sfas for pro forma disclosures  using a straight line method 
we elected the modified prospective method in adopting sfas r  under which prior periods are not retroactively restated 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we use the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of significant assumptions including an estimate of the average period of time employees will retain vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited before completing vesting requirements and the risk free interest rate 
changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related expense recognized 
the assumptions we use in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent our best estimates  which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our equity based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
see note  stock based compensation  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional information 
marketable securities and other investments 
as of may   we held a total of million in marketable securities and million in investments in auction rate securities 
we account for marketable securities and other investments in accordance with provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
sfas addresses the accounting and reporting for investments in fixed maturity securities and for equity securities with readily determinable fair values 
management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date 
as of may   all marketable securities we held were classified as available for sale and our entire auction rate securities portfolio was classified as short term investments 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value as determined by market prices quotes  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our investments in auction rate securities are carried at estimated fair value with any related impairment being classified as either temporary and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity or as other than temporary and recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
the cost basis of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income 
in the absence of a liquid market or negotiated sales transaction  we estimate the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities based on information available to us including various valuation models which include numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of each security  expected cash flows  discount rates  credit ratings  workout periods  and overall capital market liquidity 
these assumptions  assessments and the interpretations of relevant market data are subject to uncertainties  are difficult to predict and require significant judgment 
the use of different assumptions  applying different judgment to inherently subjective matters could result in significantly different estimates of fair value 
we review impairments in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf and fsp sfas and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is viewed as temporary 
unrealized losses are recognized in net income when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
we review our investments on an ongoing basis for indications of possible impairment and proper classification of any impairment once identified 
determination of whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary requires significant judgment 
the primary factors that we consider in classifying the impairment include the extent and time the fair value of each investment has been below cost  the expected holding or recovery period for each investment  and our intent and ability to hold each investment until recovery

during these periods the businesses were in the process of integrating 
we have provided these separate metrics in the areas where we could reasonably calculate an impact 
all references to the effect of the distinction between legacy lawson and intentia are therefore approximate 
although we operate as one business segment  due to the size of the intentia acquisition on lawson s historical operations  we believe this distinction  while not exact  provides relevant insight into the changes in results of operations for fiscal compared to separate identification between legacy lawson and intentia data has become increasingly difficult as our integration efforts have continued through fiscal and is therefore generally not included in our discussion of changes in results of operations from fiscal to the discussion that follows relating to our results of operations for the comparable fiscal years ended may   and  should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financials statements and notes and with the information presented in the above table

we generate revenues from licensing software  providing maintenance on licensed products and providing consulting services 
we generally utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products  maintenance and consulting services are sold to our customers 
as our maintenance and consulting services are primarily attributable to our licensed products  growth in our maintenance and consulting services is generally tied to the level of our license contracting activity 
fiscal total revenues increased to million as compared to million in fiscal year to date increases were experienced in all our revenue streams  with maintenance representing the largest dollar increase at million and license fees representing the largest percentage increase at 
the growth in total revenues in fiscal over fiscal was primarily attributable to the addition of the intentia business 
a total of million  or  of this increase was attributable to the intentia revenue streams and the remaining million  or  was attributable to growth in the legacy lawson revenue streams 
license fees 
our license fees primarily consist of fees resulting from products licensed to customers on a perpetual basis 
product license fees result from a customer s licensing of a given software product for the first time or with a customer s licensing of additional users for previously licensed products 
license fee revenues for fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal the growth in license fee revenues was primarily driven by a net increase of million in new software licenses and an increase in the recognition of deferred license revenues of million 
the increase in deferred license revenue recognized included the effect of a purchase accounting adjustment made in connection with our acquisition of intentia 
this adjustment reduced intentia s deferred revenue balance and reduced the amount of deferred revenue recognized in fiscal these increases in license revenues were partially offset by a million increase in revenues currently deferred which was primarily due to a decrease in our average conversion rate of approximately five percentage points 
the decrease in our average conversion rate was primarily related to the deferral of certain significant contracts entered into during the second half of fiscal the total number of licensing transactions decreased by to  in fiscal as compared to  last year primarily due to a reduction in the number of lawson system foundation lsf transactions in the current year 
the number of licensing transactions with new customers increased slightly to in fiscal compared to in fiscal our total licensing transactions greater than million also remained flat at however  our average selling price related to licensing transactions increased over last year

excluding intentia s license revenues  license fees for legacy lawson slightly decreased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to total license revenues 
in fiscal  deals greater than million decreased to seven from ten in fiscal  which led to lower contracted license amounts  which in turn led to lower license fee revenues 
an increase in the amount of revenue that was deferred  including the full deferral of certain contracts  also attributed to the lower license fee revenues for s products 
the number of licensing transactions with new customers decreased to in fiscal down from in fiscal despite the slight decrease in license fee revenues  from a product perspective  our lsf product line experienced growth of approximately million 
license fee revenues as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal  and was  and  respectively 
maintenance 
our maintenance revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll and renew licensed products in our maintenance program 
this program entitles our customers to product enhancements  technical support services  and on going compatibility with third party operating systems  databases and hardware 
these fees are typically charged annually and are based on the license fees initially paid by the customer 
maintenance revenues can fluctuate based on the number and timing of new license contracts  renewal rates and price increases 
maintenance revenues for fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal this increase was primarily driven by the migration of our customers  primarily in our emea region  to lawson total care agreements 
lawson total care is our comprehensive customer care program which includes among other things software upgrades  updates  corrections  as well as various levels of support 
fiscal also benefited as compared to last year as a result of the million fair value purchase accounting adjustment reflected in fiscal maintenance revenues  which was partially offset by a similar million fair value adjustment in fiscal  both adjustments reduced maintenance revenues in the respective periods 
in addition  price increases and maintenance agreements associated with new customers also contributed to the increase in maintenance revenues 
fiscal renewal rates were stable through the year 
maintenance revenues increased by million  or  for fiscal due mostly to maintenance revenues of million  or  added with the purchase of intentia that was not included within our maintenance revenues in fiscal maintenance revenues for the m product line from intentia continued to be adversely impacted by the fair value purchase accounting adjustments as a result of the acquisition 
this fair value purchase accounting adjustment had the expected effect of lowering the maintenance revenues from m maintenance services by million for fiscal the remaining million of the total increase was due to our legacy lawson maintenance revenue increases 
the higher maintenance revenues were influenced by an increase in renewal rates from in to in price increases and maintenance agreements associated with new customers also contributed to the higher maintenance revenues

see note  restructuring  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional information 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
amortization of acquired intangibles for fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal this increase is related to the on going amortization of intangibles acquired in the intentia merger primarily due to certain intangibles being amortized based on estimated cash flows as compared to a straight line basis  resulting in higher amortization expense in the current fiscal year

in addition  during fiscal  we recorded income tax benefits of million for tax deductions in excess of historical book deductions related to employee stock option exercises  as compared to million in fiscal these tax benefits  which decreased current income taxes payable and increased additional paid in capital by equal amounts  had no effect on our provision for income taxes  however  it did result in a significant decrease in the amount of our cash tax outlay 
beginning in fiscal  with the adoption of sfas r  stock compensation and the related tax deductions were included in our consolidated statement of operations 
our global provision for income taxes for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in the global provision was related to the mix of income in the various jurisdictions where we operate and continual losses in certain jurisdictions where valuation allowances are required 
furthermore  in we increased our tax reserves for uncertain tax matters while in our increases to global tax reserves were largely offset due to the favorable resolution of certain issues 
our global effective income tax rate for fiscal was not meaningful due to our overall pre tax consolidated book loss 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was 
in april  the company acquired intentia 
as of the date of the acquisition  many of the intentia legal entities had net operating loss carryforwards with full valuation allowances applied against them

the million decrease in cash received from accounts receivable was primarily due to a million reduction of intentia receivable that was partially offset by an increase in legacy lawson receivable resulting from strong fourth quarter sales 
the million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets is largely due to the collection of an income tax refund

the facility is secured by a corporate letter of guaranty by lawson software  inc as of may   under million was outstanding under the guarantee line and approximately million was available for use 
senior convertible notes in april  we issued million of senior convertible notes with net proceeds  after expenses  of approximately million 
the notes mature on april  the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum payable semi annually in arrears  on april and october of each year  beginning october  the notes do not contain any restrictive financial covenants 
the notes are convertible  at the holder s option  into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share which reflects a conversion premium based on the closing sale price of per share of lawson common stock as reported by nasdaq on april  
we effectively raised the conversion price to approximately per share which reflects a premium when compared to the closing sale price of per share by simultaneously entering into separate agreements to purchase call options and sell warrants 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the notes 
on august   we filed the shelf registration statement  which became effective on that date 
see note  long term debt and credit facilities  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional information 
restricted cash we had million held as restricted cash as of may  this balance relates to various guarantees of our properties worldwide and million and million have been classified as current and non current assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheet 
the million balance as of may  included approximately million related to collateral to secure a bank guarantee for the settlement of the purchase of the remaining shares of intentia 
the arbitration process associated with the settlement of the untendered shares of intentia required us to maintain a specified amount as security for a bank guaranty to secure lawson s obligation should additional amounts be due to the holders 
on october   the arbitration panel ruled that no such additional amounts were due and the matter was closed 
as a result  the bank lifted the restriction on the remaining balance and we repatriated the funds 
this transfer was reflected in the second quarter of fiscal auction rate securities as of may   we held a total of million in short term investments in auction rate securities reflecting an million impairment from their original par value of approximately million 
these investments are governed by our investment policy  the objective of which is to provide as high a level of current income as is consistent with preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity 
approved investments include us government securities and investments in corporations and municipalities rated aa or higher  including investments in auction rate securities 
the uncertainties in the credit markets have had a significant affect on our holdings in auction rate securities 
our investments in auction rate securities represent interests in collateralized debt obligations and are supported primarily by high grade  short term commercial paper 
auction rate securities are structured to provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined calendar intervals  generally every days 
this mechanism has historically allowed existing investors either to rollover their holdings  whereby they would continue to own their respective securities  or liquidate their holdings by selling such securities at par 
this auction process has historically provided a liquid market for these securities 
since early august  these auctions have not had sufficient buyers to cover investors sell orders  resulting in unsuccessful auctions 
when an auction is unsuccessful  the interest rate is re set to a level pre determined by the loan documents and remains in effect until the next auction date  at which time the process repeats 
during fiscal  auctions related to our investments in auction rate securities became unsuccessful 
since the auction rate securities market began experiencing failed auctions  we have closely monitored our portfolio and the conditions in the credit and capital markets 
all scheduled interest payments were made during the year however  uncertainties in the credit markets and liquidity issues relating to these investments resulted in a decline in the fair value of our portfolio of auction rate securities 
given the complexity of auction rate securities and the lack of readily observable market quotes related to these investments  we previously used various models to assist in our analysis and assessment of the fair value of our portfolio 
however  on july   we sold our auction rate securities portfolio for million in cash  the carrying value as of may  in light of this transaction  the million of impairment losses previously recorded in the second and third quarters of fiscal and determined to be temporary and reflected in a separate component of stockholders equity were reclassified as other than temporary and included in our results of operations for fiscal as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million for fiscal which was included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  we reclassified the presentation of our auction rate securities to short term investments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
repurchase of common shares in november of  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program of up to million of common stock  which was subsequently increased to million by the board of directors in april the share repurchases are funded using our existing cash balance and future cash flows and occur through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions and or transactions structured through investment banking institutions as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements 
market conditions influence the timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased 
from inception of the repurchase program through may   we used million to repurchase million shares at an average price of per share 
the repurchased shares are recorded as treasury stock and result in a reduction to our stockholders equity 
the shares will be used for general corporate purposes 
as of may   the maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under this program was million 
on july   our board of directors increased the maximum authorized for repurchase purposes by an additional million  to million  increasing the maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the program to million 
included in the repurchases in fiscal were million shares purchased from the lawson family investment company  ltd  an entity affiliated with h

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency 
our market risk includes the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenue was denominated in a foreign currency 
we manage foreign currency market risk  from time to time  using forward contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are expected to be offset by gains or losses on forward contracts 
this is expected to mitigate the possibility of significant foreign currency transaction gains or losses in future periods 
for the fiscal  our foreign currency exposures were primarily related to non functional currency intercompany loans and advances to from our international subsidiaries 
as of july   we changed the operating structure of our european subsidiaries whereby our non functional currency exposure increased significantly for other balance sheet accounts  particularly accounts receivable  accounts payable and certain accrual accounts 
therefore  the volume of our hedging activities increased during fiscal we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short term in nature  maturing within days or less 
we mark to market all contracts at the end of each reporting period and unrealized gains and losses are included in the consolidated statement of operations for that period 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
the net fair value of foreign currency forward contracts was a million net asset as of may  and was included in prepaid expenses and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
the corresponding net million unrealized gain was included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as of may  interest rates 
our short term investments consist of financial instruments  primarily money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  and the u 
s 
government and agencies 
as of may    these investments were primarily denominated in us dollars 
investments with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents 
as of may   the average maturity of our investment securities was less than three months and all investment securities had maturities less than months 
as of may   we consider the reported amounts of these investments to be reasonable approximations of fair values 
we do not consider changes in the market interest rates related to these investments to be a significant risk 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our senior convertible notes due april  the fair value of our convertible senior notes may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
our senior convertible notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per year 
as of may   the carrying value of our convertible senior notes was million  including million of deferred debt issuance costs and the fair value was approximately million
