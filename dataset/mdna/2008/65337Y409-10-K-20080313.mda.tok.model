at december   we have accrued for million in additional purchase consideration payable to the selling shareholders of ipwireless as a result of the achievement of certain revenue milestones in as specified in the acquisition agreement 
of the total amount accrued  million is expected to be paid in cash and million is expected to be paid through the issuance of shares of our common stock 
the actual number of shares to be issued will be based on the average closing price of our common stock for the consecutive trading days ending with the third trading day immediately preceding the actual payment date 
we anticipate that the substantial majority of the amount due will be paid in march additional purchase consideration of up to million may be paid to the selling shareholders of ipwireless based upon the achievement of certain revenue milestones in and  inclusive  as specified in the acquisition agreement  with potential payments of up to million in and up to million in if earned  up to million of such additional consideration will be payable in cash or shares of common stock at our election  up to million of such amounts will be payable in cash or shares of common stock at the election of the representative of ipwireless shareholders and up to million is required to be paid in cash 
additional purchase consideration of up to million and million may be paid to the selling shareholders of go networks in shares of our common stock and cash  respectively  subject to the achievement of certain operational milestones in february and august we expect to complete our analysis of the february milestone measurement by march  during the  we also consummated transactions to acquire licensed wireless spectrum rights totaling million  which includes the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of canada inc  a canadian company whose assets are comprised almost entirely of wireless spectrum  for million in cash  and the acquisitions of spectrum in other locations  including switzerland  texas and illinois  for a total of million in cash and million in future lease obligations 
in november  we entered into definitive agreements to lease wireless spectrum located in california for initial payments aggregating million  plus annual lease payments approximating million through the leases expire on various dates through and each provides for three consecutive year renewals 
capital expenditures totaled million during and were primarily related to our acquisition of a build to suit office building in las vegas  nevada  interior improvements to our leased facilities in san diego  california and expansions of our lab facilities and semiconductor test equipment assets 
significant financing activities in on march   we issued and sold  shares of our series a senior convertible preferred stock the series a preferred stock at a price of  per share resulting in net proceeds of million 
costs incurred to issue the shares totaled million 
the net proceeds are used to fund operations  accelerate the development of new wireless technologies  expand our business  and enable future strategic acquisitions 
holders of the series a preferred stock are entitled to receive quarterly dividends on the liquidation preference at a rate of per annum 
until march  we can elect whether to declare dividends in cash or to not declare and pay dividends  in which case the per share dividend amount will be added to the liquidation preference 
from and after march  we must declare dividends in cash each quarter  subject to applicable law 
we accrued for million in undeclared dividends during we will be required to redeem all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock  if any  on march   at a price equal to the liquidation preference plus unpaid dividends 
if we elect to convert the series a preferred stock after our common stock price has reached the qualifying threshold  we must redeem the shares of holders of series a preferred stock who elect not to convert into common stock at a price equal to of the liquidation preference 
during  we paid million in interest on our senior secured notes due we are obligated to pay interest of per annum semi annually in january and july each year  or million per year 
the purchase agreement for the senior secured notes contains representations and warranties  affirmative and negative covenants including  without limitation  our obligation to not become liable to any additional indebtedness  subject to certain exceptions including the ability to enter into spectrum leases or to incur million of acquired company debt or purchase money indebtedness 
as of december   we have become liable for additional indebtedness totaling million  and were in compliance with all note covenants 
during  we paid million in cash distributions that were accrued for in to the former nextwave wireless llc membership holders 
looking forward as of december   we had million of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and million in restricted cash required to be reserved under our senior secured notes 
on march   we amended the original purchase agreement for the notes 
under the amended purchase agreement  we may withdraw up to the full amount of the million cash reserve account for use in funding our business plan  subject to the payment of a consent fee of million per million withdrawn 
the amended purchase agreement also permits us to incur an additional million of indebtedness to fund a working capital line of credit subject to specified subordination terms  and an additional million of second lien indebtedness our ability incur the second lien indebtedness remains subject to negotiation of intercreditor terms that are reasonably satisfactory to the holders of at least two thirds in aggregate principal amount of the notes and the provider of such funding must be reasonably satisfactory to the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
in addition  the amended purchase agreement restricts the types of investments that can be held in the cash reserve account to exclude auction rate or similar securities 
as of december   million of our marketable securities were invested in auction rate securities ars 
none of the auctions involving our ars holdings had failed as of december  through march   auctions for eight ars  including certain municipalities and education auction rate securities  with principal amounts aggregating million  were not successful due to recent weakness in the auction markets 
the unsuccessful securities are district of columbia savrs freedom forum a insured by mbia  houston tex util sys rev adj rfdg comb insured by ambac  education loan trust insured by ffelp  utah state board of rgts insured by ffelp  indiana transportation finance authority insured by cifg  indiana secondary market education loans insured by ffelp  illinois student assist comm backed by student loan  and kentucky higher education insured by ffelp 
the interest rates on these securities at the date of the failed auction range from to  with a weighted average rate of 
as a result  we continue to hold these securities and the issuers are required pay interest on the securities at the maximum contractual rates 
we reduced our total ars investments principally by investing in other short term marketable securities  as individual ars reset periods came due 
unsuccessful auctions have caused us to hold these securities beyond their scheduled auction reset dates  limiting the short term liquidity of these investments 
such developments may result in the classification of some or all of these securities as long term in our consolidated balance sheets in or future periods 
in addition  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may  in the future  be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments which would result in a charge to our consolidated statement of operations 
based on current market conditions  there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining ars in our investment portfolio will be successful 
unsuccessful auctions will cause us to hold securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates and limit the short term liquidity of these investments 
while these failures in the auction process have affected our ability to access these funds in the near term  we do not believe that the underlying securities or collateral have been affected 
we believe that the higher reset rates on failed auctions provide sufficient incentive for the security issuers to address this lack of liquidity 
however  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining ars in the near term may be limited 
these developments may result in the classification of some or all of these securities as long term in our consolidated financial statements in or future periods 
in addition  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may  in the future  be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an impairment charge 
excluding ars  at february   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
in february  we executed a loan agreement with hughes systique corporation  our equity method investee  for senior secured convertible notes  whereby we have committed to make available up to million in funding 
the commitment expires in february and all principal and interest is due three years from the date of the advance 
at the maturity date or upon a default event  we have the option to convert any unpaid amounts into shares of preferred stock of hughes systique 
we anticipate that our businesses  other than the multimedia software business of our packetvideo subsidiary  will require further substantial investment before our revenues are sufficient to fund our expenses and generate earnings our wireless broadband products  services and technologies  which are in the semiconductor segment  are in the pre commercialization stage of development and will require a substantial investment before they may become commercially viable 
although we currently anticipate that our second generation wimax semiconductor technologies designed for high volume commercial production will initially be available in the first half of  we are currently unable to project when our chipsets  network components and related technology licensing agreements based on wimax and wi fi technologies will be commercially deployed 
go networks  inc  acquired in february  which is in the networks segment  develops high performance mobile wi fi products and services for commercial and municipal service providers 
go networks will continue to require working capital funding through to invest in establishing worldwide sales and distribution channels  along with high volume manufacturing capabilities and related administrative and information technology products and services to support anticipated unit volume growth 
ipwireless  inc  acquired in may  which is in the networks segment  is a leading supplier of td cdma based mobile broadband network equipment and subscriber terminals 
we expect increased investment through in augmenting sales and distribution channels  working capital  capital equipment and research and development with respect to the commercialization of tdtv  wimax  and additional public safety products 
inquam broadband and wimax telecom  which are in the strategic initiatives segment  are strategic investments in european wireless spectrum and wireless broadband network operations and we are presently exploring alternative plans in order to further enhance these investments in if these plans are successful  we do expect further working capital investments will be needed to expand these businesses 
if we are unable to liquidate our ars when we need such liquidity for business purposes  we may need to change or postpone such business purposes or find alternative financing for such business purposes  if available 
if funding is insufficient at any time in the future  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products or services  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could harm our business 
based on the operating plan for the year ended december  approved by our board of directors  management believes our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  the release of the million of restricted cash and cash forecasted to be generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our estimated working capital and capital expenditures requirements through at least march if events or circumstances occur such that we do not meet our operating plan as expected  we may be required to seek additional capital and or to reduce certain discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
our long term operating success will depend on our ability to develop  introduce and market enhancements to our existing products and services  to introduce new products and services in a timely manner  which meet customer requirements and to respond to competitive pressures and technological advances 
in order for us to achieve positive operating results and positive cash flows  we will need to achieve a substantial increase in the level of revenues and achieve sufficient gross margins to cover our ongoing operating expenses and debt service costs 
we may also require additional cash resources for other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may pursue  such as investments or acquisitions of other business or technologies 
to augment our existing working capital resources in order to satisfy our cash requirements  we may seek to sell debt securities or additional equity securities or to obtain a credit facility 
our senior secured notes and our series a senior convertible preferred stock prohibit our incurrence of additional indebtedness  subject to certain premitted baskets 
the sale of equity securities or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in additional debt service obligations and could impose operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we have been approached by a number of wireless carriers with preliminary indications of interest in acquiring certain of our wireless spectrum licenses 
we plan to entertain such offers to the extent we deem the terms to be attractive and have met with a nationally recognized investment banking firm to discuss our plans for a disposition of spectrum 
there can be no assurance that any spectrum disposition will be consummated 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of intangible assets and investments  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
our accounting policies are described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from contracts to provide embedded multimedia software products for mobile devices and related royalties through our packetvideo subsidiary 
in  we also began to derive revenues from sales of wireless broadband and mobile broadcast network products and services by our newly acquired subsidiaries  ipwireless and go networks 
the wireless broadband and mobile broadcast network products and services sold by ipwireless and go networks generally include embedded software 
we also recognize revenue from customer subscriptions for the wimax network operated by our wimax telecom subsidiary 
for arrangements that do not contain software or embedded software that is more than incidental to the arrangement  we recognize revenue in accordance with the basic principles in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  that is  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for software arrangements  or in cases where the software is considered more than incidental and is essential to the functionality of the hardware products  revenue is recognized pursuant to american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and sop no 
 a modification of sop software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 applicability of sop to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
in the case of loss contracts  we also consider the provisions of sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we evaluate each deliverable in the arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting 
if objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe for all units of accounting in the arrangement  revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting or element based on those relative fair values 
if vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  but not for delivered elements  the residual method would be used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
to date  we have not been able to establish vsoe for any of the elements included in our revenue arrangements  as the software or hardware products or services have not yet been sold separately  nor has a standard price list been established 
as a result  once the software or technology is delivered and the only undelivered element is services  the entire non contingent contract value is recognized ratably over the remaining service period 
costs directly attributable to providing these services are also deferred and amortized over the remaining service period of the respective revenues 
for arrangements in which customers pay one contracted amount for multiple products and services  or a combination of products and services  we also consider eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our software arrangements can include a software or technology license  non recurring engineering nre services and post contract support pcs 
our sales of hardware can include pcs on the embedded software 
if elements cannot be treated as separate units of accounting  they are combined into a single unit of accounting and the associated revenue is deferred until all combined elements have been delivered or  until there is only one remaining element to be delivered 
services sold separately are generally billed on a time and materials basis at agreed upon billing rates  and revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
we earn royalty revenues on licensed embedded multimedia products sold by our licensees 
generally  royalties are paid by licensees on a per unit or contingent usage basis 
the licensees generally report and pay the royalty in the quarter subsequent to the period of delivery or usage 
we recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees 
if we receive non refundable advanced payments from licensees that are allocable to future contracts periods or could be creditable against other obligations of the licensee to us  the recognition of the related revenue is deferred until such future periods or until such creditable obligations lapse 
when royalty arrangements also provide for ongoing pcs that does not meet the criteria to be accrued on delivery of the software  the royalty is recognized ratably from the date the royalty report is received through the stated remaining term of the pcs arrangement 
in limited situations  we have determined that pcs revenue can be recognized upon delivery of the hardware or software 
in these situations  we have determined that if pcs is for one year or less  the estimated cost of providing pcs during the arrangement is insignificant and unspecified upgrades or enhancements offered for the particular pcs arrangement historically has been and are expected to continue to be minimal and infrequently provided 
in these limited situations  we have accrued all the estimated costs of providing the services  which to date have been insignificant 
arrangements generally do not allow for product returns and we have no history of product returns 
accordingly  no allowance for returns has been provided 
in instances where we have noted extended payment terms revenue is recognized in the period the payment becomes due 
if an arrangement includes specified upgrade rights  revenue is deferred until the specified upgrade has been delivered 
the timing and amount of revenue recognition depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable 
wireless spectrum licenses we capitalize as intangible assets wireless spectrum licenses that we acquire from third parties or through government auctions 
for wireless spectrum licenses purchased directly from third parties or through spectrum auctions  the cost basis of the wireless spectrum asset includes the purchase price paid for the license at the time of acquisition plus legal costs incurred to acquire the license 
for wireless spectrum licenses acquired through a business combination or through the acquisition of a business where the assets of the business are comprised almost entirely of wireless spectrum  the cost basis of the wireless spectrum asset is determined through an allocation of the total purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired business or asset s and includes any deferred tax liabilities determined in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for acquired temporary differences in certain purchase transactions that are not accounted for as business combinations 
for leased wireless spectrum rights  the asset and related liability are recorded at the net present value of future cash outflows using our incremental borrowing rate at the time of acquisition 
we have determined that certain of our wireless spectrum licenses meet the definition of indefinite lived intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  because the licenses are either perpetual or may be renewed periodically for a nominal fee  provided that we continue to meet the service and geographic coverage provisions 
moreover  we have determined that there are currently no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of these wireless spectrum licenses 
as of december   indefinite lived wireless spectrum licenses that are not subject to amortization totaled million 
wireless spectrum licenses for which we have acquired lease rights from third parties are considered to have finite lives 
the wireless license asset is then amortized over the contractual life of the lease 
we have also acquired the rights to wireless spectrum licenses in europe where the renewal terms are not yet well established 
we amortize these assets on a straight line basis over the initial license period 
amortization expense on wireless spectrum licenses is charged to general and administrative expense 
as of december   amortized wireless spectrum licenses  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million 
valuation of goodwill at december   the aggregate carrying value of our goodwill was million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we do not amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual review for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we test goodwill for impairment annually at a reporting unit level using a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we determined that our reporting units  as that term is defined in sfas no 
 are one level below our identified operating segments because discrete financial information is available 
at december   our goodwill resides in three reporting units 
we primarily utilize an income approach that includes the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of our goodwill 
the discounted cash flow method determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period 
both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows 
a weighted average cost of capital is determined for each reporting unit to be used as the discount rate 
the residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period 
alternatively  the present value of the residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period 
for the goodwill impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of  the discounted cash flows used to estimate fair value were based on discrete financial forecasts of five years for each of the reporting units 
these forecasts were developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond these periods were estimated using terminal value calculations 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value using discount rates ranging from to and terminal growth rates ranging from to 
based on the analysis  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
we cannot assure you that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows will materialize as estimated 
for example  if our projections of future customer order growth do not materialize  the fair value of our goodwill may fall below its carrying value 
therefore  we cannot assure you that when we complete our future reviews of our goodwill for impairment that a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
a variance in the discount rate or in management s forecasts would have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and consequently the amount of identified goodwill impairment  if any 
valuation of indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 we do not amortize indefinite lived intangible assets 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual review for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
indefinite lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
we test indefinite lived intangible assets by making a determination of the fair value of the intangible asset 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we also evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not subject to amortization on an annual basis to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life  that asset is tested for impairment 
after recognition of the impairment  if any  the asset is amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
at december   the aggregate carrying value of our indefinite lived wireless spectrum licenses was million 
for our indefinite lived wireless spectrum licenses  we primarily utilize a market approach which determines fair value based on observed prices paid for equivalent licenses in the market 
there are established primary and secondary markets for our wireless spectrum licenses which provide sufficient data upon which to estimate fair market values 
we also considered other factors  such as trends in spectrum prices in general and evolving technology  consumer market and regulatory issues  that may potentially affect the value of our spectrum 
we believe the market approach provides a more accurate estimate of the fair value of our indefinite lived wireless spectrum licenses as compared to an income approach 
for purposes of performing our annual impairment assessment of indefinite lived wireless spectrum licenses  we have segregated our indefinite lived intangible wireless spectrum licenses into five separate units of accounting using the guidance provided by eitf issue no 
 unit of accounting for testing of impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  based on the type of spectrum and location 
based on this analysis  we concluded that our indefinite lived wireless spectrum licenses were not impaired 
at december   the aggregate carrying value of our other indefinite lived intangible assets  which primarily consist of purchased tradenames and trademarks  was million 
for our other indefinite lived intangible assets  we primarily utilize an income approach that includes the discounted cash flow method to determine fair value 
the discounted cash flow method determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period 
both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows 
a weighted average cost of capital is determined for each reporting unit to be used as the discount rate 
the residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period 
alternatively  the present value of the residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period 
for the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of  the discounted cash flows used to estimate fair value were based on discrete financial forecasts of five years for each of the reporting units 
these forecasts were developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond these periods were estimated using terminal value calculations 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of and a terminal growth rate of 
based on this analysis  we concluded that our indefinite lived intangible assets were not impaired 
we cannot assure you that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows will materialize as estimated 
for example  if our projections of future customer order growth do not materialize  the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets may fall below their carrying value 
therefore  we cannot assure you that when we complete our future reviews of our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment that a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
a variance in the discount rate or in management s forecasts would have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and consequently the amount of identified indefinite lived intangible asset impairment  if any 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets to be held and used  including acquired intangible assets subject to amortization and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used  the loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends or the presence of other indicators that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable 
a long lived asset is considered to be impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s undiscounted future cash flows  we utilize our internal forecast of our future operating results and cash flows  our strategic business plans and anticipated future economic and market conditions 
there are inherent estimates and assumptions underlying this information and management s judgment is required in the application of this information to the determination of an asset s undiscounted future cash flows 
no assurance can be given that the underlying estimates and assumptions utilized in our determination of an asset s undiscounted future cash flows will materialize as anticipated 
during  we did not identify any conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment of our long lived assets 
valuation of share based awards we account for the grant of employee share based awards under provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payments sfas no 
r 
accordingly  we estimate the fair value of our share based stock awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain input variables  as follows expected volatility 
volatility is a measure of the amount the stock price will fluctuate during the expected life of an award 
we determine expected volatility based on an average of the historical stock price volatilities of certain of our peer companies due to lack of trading history of our common stock 
risk free interest rate 
our assumption of the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us constant rate treasury securities in effect at the time of the grant with remaining terms equivalent to the respective expected terms of the share based award 
expected dividend yield 
because we have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  we assume a dividend yield of zero 
expected award life 
as none of the plans have sufficient history for estimating the term from grant date to full exercise of the option  we consider expected terms applied  in part  by certain of our peer companies to determine the expected life of each grant 
under sfas no 
r  we are also required to estimate at the grant date the likelihood that the award will ultimately vest the pre vesting forfeiture rate  and revise the estimate  if necessary  in future periods if the actual forfeiture rate differs 
we determine the pre vesting forfeiture rate of an award based on industry and employee turnover data as well as an historical pre vesting forfeitures occurring over the previous year 
under the true up provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize additional share based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated and a recovery of previously recognized share based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than estimated 
we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under sfas no 
r 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  in our opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes option pricing model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with sfas no 
r and the sab no 
 share based payment  using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer and willing seller market transaction 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods than those currently applied  the share based compensation expense that we recognize in the future may differ significantly from what we have reported historically 
purchased in process research and development costs the values allocated to purchased in process research and development costs were based on projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses and were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry 
these costs were expensed at the respective dates of acquisition 
the fair values assigned to purchased in process research and development projects were determined by applying the income approach using the excess earnings methodology which involves estimating the future discounted cash flows to be derived from the currently existing technologies 
the following table summarizes our significant assumptions at the acquisition dates underlying the valuations of in process research and development for our acquisitions completed in  and dollars in millions project weighted average estimated percent complete average estimated time to complete estimated cost to complete risk adjusted discount rate estimated fair value acquisitions ipwireless soc wireless device chip sdc video and audio software for handsets acquisitions cygnus e base station and low power asic products acquisition packetvideo music on demand software  reference design platform and internet signaling protocol additionally  we acquired tusonic s server and database applications for delivering music related content using web services development project which was determined to have an estimated fair value of million using a risk adjusted discount rate of 
at december   the soc wireless device chip development project at ipwireless was still in process 
all other acquired in process research and development projects were substantially completed 
actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the respective acquisitions 
the assumptions consist primarily of expected completion dates for the in process research and development projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections for the products once they have entered the market 
litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results  liquidity or financial position  we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with our legal proceedings based on our belief that a liability  while possible  is not probable 
further  any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
income taxes we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  effective december   the beginning of our fiscal year 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
requires that we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
the initial application of fin no 
to our tax positions had no impact on stockholders equity

recent accounting pronouncements in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
sfas no 
r also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect sfas no 
r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 
we are still assessing the impact of this standard on our future consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements and amendment of arb no 
the provisions of sfas no 
establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interests of a subsidiary 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for us on in fiscal year and will be applied prospectively  except for the presentation of the noncontrolling interests  which for all periods would be reclassified to equity in the consolidated balance sheet and adjusted out of net income in the consolidated statements of operations 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of sfas no 
on our future consolidated financial statements 
in june the fasb ratified eitf no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf requires non refundable advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities to be recorded as an asset and the payments to be expensed when the research and development activities are performed 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no

under sfas no 
 the decision to measure items at fair value is made at specified election dates on an irrevocable instrument by instrument basis 
entities electing the fair value option would be required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings and to expense upfront cost and fees associated with the item for which the fair value option is elected 
entities electing the fair value option are required to distinguish on the face of the statement of financial position  the fair value of assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and similar assets and liabilities measured using another measurement attribute 
if elected  sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year that begins on december   with earlier adoption permitted provided that the entity also early adopts all of the requirements of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   our investment portfolios included unrestricted and restricted investment securities with fair values of million and million  respectively 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
interest income earned on our investments is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
these income streams are generally not hedged 
as of december   million of our marketable securities were invested in auction rate securities ars 
through march   we had reduced our total investments in ars to million  principally by investing in other short term marketable securities as individual ars reset periods came due and the securities were once again subject to the auction process 
through march   auctions for eight of these securities  with principal amounts aggregating million  were unsuccessful due to recent weakness in the auction markets 
as a result  we continued to hold these securities and earn interest at the maximum contractual rate 
based on current market conditions  there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining ars in our investment portfolio will be successful 
unsuccessful auctions will cause us to hold securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates and limit the short term liquidity of these investments 
while these failures in the auction process have affected our ability to access these funds in the near term  we do not believe that the underlying securities or collateral have been affected 
we believe that the higher reset rates on failed auctions provide sufficient incentive for the security issuers to address this lack of liquidity 
however  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining ars in the near term may be limited 
these developments may result in the classification of some or all of these securities as long term in our consolidated financial statements in or future periods 
in addition  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may  in the future  be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an impairment charge 
due to the relatively short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate ten percent change in interest rates eg to would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency risk in addition to our us operations  we conduct business through subsidiaries in europe  israel  asia pacific  canada and south america 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly fluctuations in the pound sterling  euro  israeli shekel and swiss franc exchange rates 
additionally  a portion of our sales to customers located in foreign countries  specifically certain sales by our ipwireless subsidiary  are denominated in euros  which subjects us to foreign currency risks related to those transactions 
we analyze our exposure to currency fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to reduce the effect of these potential fluctuations 
we do not currently have hedging contracts in effect
