item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a 
general the primary objective of this financial review is to provide an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of the wilber corporation and its subsidiaries for each of the years in the three year period ended december  this discussion and tabular presentations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes presented in part ii  item  of this document 
our financial performance is heavily dependent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividend income earned on our loans and investment securities less the interest paid on our deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses  investment securities gains losses  service charges on deposit accounts  trust and investment service fees  insurance commission income  the net gain on sale of loans  the increase on the cash surrender value on bank owned life insurance  other service fees and other income 
our non interest expenses consist of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  computer service fees  advertising and marketing  professional fees  other miscellaneous expenses and taxes 
results of operations are also influenced by general economic conditions particularly changes in interest rates  competitive conditions  government policies  changes in federal or state tax law  and the actions of our regulatory authorities 
k 
index critical accounting policies 
management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
while management s current evaluation of the allowance for loan losses indicates that the allowance is adequate  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  the allowance would need to be increased 
for example  if historical loan loss experience significantly worsened or if current economic conditions significantly deteriorated  additional provisions for loan losses would be required to increase the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  the assumptions and estimates used in the internal reviews of the company s non performing loans and potential problem loans have a significant impact on the overall analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management has concluded that the evaluation of collateral values was reasonable under the circumstances for each of the reported periods  if collateral valuations were significantly lowered  the company s allowance for loan losses would also require an additional provision for loan losses 
our policy on the allowance for loan losses is disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
a more detailed description of the allowance for loan losses is included in part ii  item ci  of this document 
all accounting policies are important  and as such  we encourage the reader to review each of the policies included in note of the consolidated financial statements provided in part ii  item  of this document to obtain a better understanding of how our financial performance is reported 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas r 
sfas r retains the fundamental requirements of sfas no 
that the acquisition method of accounting formerly the purchase method be used for all business combinations  that an acquirer be identified for each business combination  and that intangible assets be identified and recognized separately from goodwill 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
additionally  sfas no r changes the requirements for recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies and recognizing and measuring contingent consideration 
sfas no r also enhances the disclosure requirements for business combinations 
sfas no r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  and may not be applied before that date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 sfas 
sfas amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
among other things  sfas clarifies that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements and requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the non controlling interest 
sfas also amends sfas  earnings per share  so that earnings per share calculations in consolidated financial statements will continue to be based on amounts attributable to the parent 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  and is applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which are to be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings sab 
sab provides views on the accounting for written loan commitments recorded at fair value under gaap 
sab no 
supersedes sab  application of accounting principles to loan commitments 
specifically  sab states that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan should be included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings 
the provisions of sab are applicable on a prospective basis to written loan commitments recorded at fair value under gaap that are issued or modified in fiscal quarters beginning after december  sab is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in february  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption was permitted  however  we did not elect early adoption and therefore adopted the k 
index standard on january  upon adoption  we did not elect the fair value option for any eligible items that existed at january  
in september  fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements eitf 
eitf will require that the postretirement aspects of an endorsement type split dollar life insurance arrangement be recognized as a liability by the employer and that the obligation is not effectively settled by the purchase of life insurance 
companies adopting eitf will be able to choose between retrospective application to all prior periods or treating the application of eitf as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings or to other components of equity or net assets in the statement of condition 
eitf will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have split dollar life insurance arrangements with current and former executives of the bank that are subject to eitf we adopted eitf effective for the fiscal year that began on january   at which time we recorded a thousand liability and an equal and offsetting reduction to our beginning retained earnings 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and for interim periods within those years 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands the related disclosure requirements 
the expanded disclosures include a requirement to disclose fair value measurements according to a hierarchy  segregating measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities  significant other observable inputs  and significant unobservable inputs 
sfas no 
will affect certain of our fair value disclosures  but is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the portion of our assets and liabilities with fair values based on unobservable inputs is not significant

performance overview for the year ended december  during several of our key performance measures improved  as compared to net income  earnings per share  return on assets  and return on equity all increased in specifically  net income increased from million in to million in  a thousand or increase 
earnings per share  return on assets  and return on equity increased from   and  respectively  in  to   and  respectively  in during  there was an increase in total non interest income  a reduction in the provision for loan losses and a reduction in income taxes 
these improvements were offset by a decrease in net interest income and an increase in total non interest expense 
although most of our performance measures improved during  the improvement was largely due to a thousand decrease in the provision for loan losses and three unusual events that largely impacted non interest income 
first  during the first quarter of we recorded a thousand gain on the disposal of fixed assets due to the recognition of a deferred gain on the sale of our norwich town  new york chenango county branch building and contents 
second  in may a senior executive of the bank unexpectedly passed away 
as a result  in the second quarter of we recorded a thousand non taxable gain on life insurance coverage maintained by the bank on the senior executive 
and finally  due to a regional flood in the second quarter of  we recorded approximately thousand in losses and expenses due to the disposal impairment of fixed assets for two of our branch office buildings and their contents and subsequent business resumption costs 
we applied for various flood relief grants from various new york state agencies due to the flood and were awarded thousand of grant funding  thousand of which was recorded in the combined positive impact on net income from these events for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  was approximately million 
the improvement in net income due to these three unusual events was offset  in part  by a decrease in net interest income and an increase in non interest expense 
during  we generally operated in a flat or inverted interest rate climate  which resulted in a thousand decrease in net interest income between the periods 
non interest expense increased by thousand or between and largely due to increases in salaries and employee benefits expense

index asset composition our assets are comprised of earning and non earning assets 
earning assets include our investment securities  loans  interest bearing deposits at other banks and federal funds sold 
non earning assets include our real estate and other assets acquired as the result of foreclosure  facilities  equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  non interest bearing deposits at other banks and cash 
we generally maintain approximately to of our total assets in earning assets 
during the composition of our assets changed modestly 
the total loans to total assets ratio was at december   as compared to at december  total assets during  total assets increased from million at december  to million at december   a million or increase 
the growth in total assets was principally funded by an increase in deposit liabilities 
during  deposit liabilities increased million or  from million at december  to million at december  throughout most of  opportunities to increase borrowings were limited due to an unfavorable flat or inverted yield curve  thereby curbing potential growth in funding  and  in turn  total asset growth 
investment securities our investment securities portfolio consists of trading  available for sale  and held to maturity securities 
the following table summarizes our trading  available for sale  and held to maturity investment securities portfolio for the periods indicated 
summary of investment securities at december amortized cost estimated fair value amortized cost estimated fair value amortized cost estimated fair value in thousands trading available for sale us treasuries obligations of us government corporations and agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions municipal bonds mortgage backed securities corporate securities equity securities total available for sale held to maturity obligations of states and political subdivisions municipal bonds mortgage backed securities total held to maturity these securities are held by the company for its non qualified executive deferred compensation plan 
certain figures have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation 
between december  and december   our total investment securities portfolio including trading  available for sale  and held to maturity decreased million or 
during we received proceeds from sales and maturities of securities totaling million  versus new purchases of million 
proceeds from the sale or maturity of the investment securities portfolio were generally used to purchase new investment securities  since most of our loan growth was funded by new deposit liabilities 
k 
index during we continued to maintain a concentration in mortgage backed securities 
these included both mortgage pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
at the end of  our mortgage backed securities portfolio comprised of the carrying value of our investment securities portfolio 
this compares to and at the end of and  respectively 
approximately of our mortgage backed securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government through a ginnie mae guarantee 
the remaining are guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac  which are government sponsored enterprises 
although our mortgage backed securities are guaranteed by us government agencies  they are susceptible to prepayment risk 
for example  if residential mortgage interest rates were to drop significantly  the yield on our mortgage backed securities would also decline 
when mortgage rates are low  homeowners often refinance their existing mortgage loans or purchase new homes 
this increases the amount of principal payments we receive on our mortgage backed securities  which  in turn  increases the amount of net amortization expense we record as an offset to interest income  thereby decreasing the yield on the securities 
the estimated fair value of the investment portfolio is largely dependent upon the interest rate environment at the time the market price is determined 
as interest rates decline  the estimated fair value of bonds generally increases  and conversely  as interest rates increase  the estimated fair value of bonds generally decreases 
at december   the net unrealized loss on the available for sale investment securities portfolio was million 
by comparison  at december   the net unrealized loss on the available for sale investment securities portfolio was million 
the general level of interest rates was lower at december   as compared to the general level of interest rates at december   which caused a general decrease in the net unrealized loss on the available for sale investment securities portfolio between the periods 
the net unrealized loss on the available for sale investment securities portfolio as a percent of the amortized cost was at december   versus at december  the following table sets forth information regarding the carrying value  weighted average yields and anticipated principal repayments of the bank s investment securities portfolio as of december  all amortizing security principal payments  including collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage pass through securities  are included based on their expected average lives 
callable securities  primarily callable agency securities  and municipal bonds are assumed to mature on their maturity date 
available for sale securities are shown at fair value 
held to maturity securities are shown at their amortized cost 
the yields on debt securities shown in the table below are calculated by dividing annual interest  including accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums  by the amortized cost of the securities at december  yields on obligations of states and municipalities exempt from federal taxation were not tax effected

these estimates were provided by a third party investment securities analyst and are used to provide comparisons with other companies in the banking industry 
the k 
index estimates were based upon the projected cash flows to the most likely call date of our investment securities portfolio taking into consideration the unique characteristics of the individual securities held by us 
our estimate may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to our concentration in mortgage backed securities 
the credit quality of our debt securities is strong 
at december   of the securities held in our available for sale and held to maturity investment securities portfolio were rated a or better by moody s credit rating services  were rated aaa 
this compares to and  respectively  for the period ended december  the following table summarizes the insured and uninsured status of the bank s municipal securities portfolio excluding notes issued directly by the bank to local municipalities at december  the values and percentages presented are based on the par value of municipal securities portfolio at december  obligations of states and political subdivisions municipal bonds credit quality table dollars in thousands aaa aa a not rated uninsured un enhanced insured enhanced uninsured un enhanced insured enhanced un enhanced un enhanced total total aaa total aa moody s ratings we purchase our municipal securities based on the underlying creditworthiness of the issuing municipality and have not relied on the insurance enhancement attached to the security 
at december   the equity securities in our available for sale portfolio had a fair value of thousand 
these securities are held by the company and were comprised of common stocks of other banking institutions 
by comparison  the market value of this portfolio was thousand at december  other investments at december  we held million of non marketable equity securities including million in fhlbny stock  a million equity interest in a small business investment company  meridian venture partners ii  l 
p  thousand of federal reserve bank of new york stock  thousand in new york business development corporation stock  and thousand in small title insurance agency 
by comparison  at december   the estimated fair value of our non marketable equity securities totaled million  a thousand or net increase between the periods 
during  we contributed thousand of additional capital toward our small business investment company to fund additional equity investments 
federal funds sold and time deposits with other banks in the normal course of business  we sell and purchase federal funds to and from other banks to meet our daily liquidity needs 
we generally target our federal funds sold position to be between million and million 
we believe these levels provide us ample levels of short term liquidity to meet loan funding needs and other working capital requirements 
because these funds are generally an unsecured obligation of the counter party  we only sell federal funds to well capitalized banks that carry strong credit ratings 
we also limit our total federal funds sold position to of the bank s equity capital or million at december  given the significant daily fluctuation in our federal funds sold position throughout the year  it is appropriate to compare the annual average federal funds sold positions rather than the positions at the end of the periods 
during our average federal funds sold position was million 
by comparison  during our average federal funds sold position was million 
on occasion we invest short term liquid funds in time deposits with other banks to improve the yield on our liquid investments 
at december   we did not hold any deposits with other banks  as compared to thousand at december  loan portfolio general 
the total loan portfolio increased million or during total loans outstanding at december   were million  as compared to million at december  during  we continued to expand our geographic market for loans 
in particular  we established a representative loan production office in clifton k 
index park  new york saratoga county and acquired provantage 
we also continued to aggressively market our small business  consumer  and residential mortgage loans in both our core rural markets and more densely populated markets including johnson city  new york broome county  syracuse  new york onondaga county  and kingston  new york ulster county 
due to these efforts  all categories of loans increased during the following table summarizes the composition of our loan portfolio over the prior five year period

at december   commercial real estate loans comprised or million of our total loan portfolio 
this compares to or million at december  throughout the five year period covered in the table above  we concentrated our efforts on opening new offices and hiring commercial lenders in large  more densely populated markets 
these efforts contributed to the increase in the outstanding balances in our commercial loan portfolio  as well 
at december   commercial loan balances outstanding totaled million 
this compares to million at december  in the first quarter of  we acquired provantage  a new york state licensed mortgage banker with four offices located throughout the capital district of new york  namely saratoga  schenectady and albany counties 
we acquired provantage to improve our residential mortgage lending capabilities and increase the outstanding balances of our residential mortgage portfolio 
at december   the outstanding balance of our residential mortgage portfolio was million 
this compares to million at december   a million or increase between the periods 
during  we competitively priced and marketed our consumer loan products  principally installment type automobile loans  which increased the consumer loan portfolio to million at december  this represents a million or increase over the december  consumer loan portfolio balance totaling million 
at december   our indirect automobile loan portfolio was comprised of  accounts  totaling million 
this compares to  accounts and million at december   a net increase in accounts and a net increase in indirect automobile loans outstanding

standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including bond financing and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing standby and commercial letters of credit are essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers 
since most of the standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
at december  and december  standby and commercial letters of credit totaled million and million  respectively 
at december  and december  the fair value of the bank s standby letters of credit was not significant 
the following table summarizes the expirations of our standby and commercial letters of credit as of december  standby and commercial letters of credit expiration table commitment expiration of standby and commercial letters of credit dollars in thousands within one year after one but within three years after three but within five years five years or greater total k 
index in addition to standby letters of credit  we have issued lines of credit and other commitments to lend to our customers 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan agreement 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
these include home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans  commercial letters of credit  and other personal and commercial lines of credit 
at december  and december   we had outstanding unfunded loan commitments of million and million  respectively  representing a million or increase period over period 
the increase in the unfunded loan commitments was primarily due to growth in the unused portion of commercial lines of credit 
asset quality and risk elements general 
one of our key objectives is to maintain strong credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio 
the following narrative provides summary information and our experience regarding the quality and risk elements of our loan portfolio 
delinquent loans 
at december   we had million of loans that were to days past due excluding non performing loans 
this equaled of total loans outstanding 
by comparison  at december  we had million of loans that were to days past due excluding non performing loans 
this equaled of total loans outstanding 
the decrease in delinquent loans between the periods was principally due to a decrease in delinquency on a few large commercial real estate loans 
we considered the level of delinquent loans at december  to be manageable and well within management s targeted guideline of less than of loans outstanding 
non accrual  past due and restructured loans 
the following chart sets forth information regarding non performing assets for the periods stated 
table of non performing assets at december  dollars in thousands loans in non accrual status residential real estate commercial real estate commercial consumer total non accruing loans loans contractually past due days or more and still accruing interest troubled debt restructured loans total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets total non performing assets as a percentage of total assets total non performing loans as a percentage of total loans includes loans secured by family residential dwellings  family residential dwellings  home equity loans and residential construction loans 
includes commercial and industrial loans  agricultural loans and obligations other than securities and leases of states and political subdivisions in the united states total non performing loans  including non accruing loans  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest  and troubled debt restructured loans increased million between december  and december   from million to million 
non performing loans as a percentage of total loans outstanding were at december   as compared to at december   a basis point increase 
during  we transferred twenty two loans from performing to non performing status 
these loans were distributed among seventeen borrowers with one borrower s indebtedness representing or million of the net increase 
the non performing loans were not concentrated to any single industry or closely related group of industries 
k 
index impaired loans 
the following table provides information on impaired loans for the periods presented as of and for the year ended december  dollars in thousands impaired loans allowance for impaired loans average recorded investment in impaired loans at december   million of the impaired loans had a specific reserve allocation of million  compared to million of impaired loans at december  with a related reserve allocation of thousand 
other real estate owned and repossessed assets 
other real estate owned oreo consists of properties formerly pledged as collateral on loans  which have been acquired by us through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
oreo is carried at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or the fair value of the real estate  less estimated costs to sell 
at both december  and december  we held modest amounts of oreo property totaling thousand and thousand  respectively 
potential problem loans 
potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing  but where known information about possible credit problems of the related borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans as non performing at some time in the future 
potential problem loans are typically loans classified by our loan rating system as substandard 
potential problem loans may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to a rating upgrade of loans previously classified as substandard or a rating downgrade of loans previously carried in a higher credit classification 
in addition  we hold an amount of commercial and commercial real estate loans with balances in excess of million 
we have identified through normal credit review procedures potential problem loans totaling million or of total loans outstanding at december  by comparison  at december   potential problem loans totaled million or of total loans outstanding 
this represents a million decrease in potential problem loans between december  and december  the decrease in potential problem loans from the period ended december  to the period ended december   was due to several factors including  repayment by some borrowers  a rating upgrade of loans previously classified as substandard  and the transfer of a significant number of loans to non performing status 
management cannot predict economic conditions or other factors that may impact each potential problem loan 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other loans will not become days or more past due  be placed on non accrual status  become restructured  or require increased allowance coverage and provision for loan losses 
loan concentrations 
we classify our loan portfolio by call report code and industry to determine and monitor the level of our loan concentrations 
we generally consider industry concentrations when the total loan obligations outstanding loans and unfunded commitments to the industry exceed of the bank s tier ii capital 
the bank s tier ii capital at december  was million  which established our industry concentration threshold at million 
we also review the geographic concentration and economic trends within each industry concentration to further segment and analyze the risk 
the following narrative summarizes our concentrations of credit 
at december  we had million in total loan obligations or of the bank s tier ii capital secured by commercial real estate cre properties or to commercial real estate developers property managers 
the office of the comptroller of the currency has set concentrations of cre loans non owner occupied at of the bank s tier ii capital 
based upon our analysis  as of december   the bank had approximately million or of the bank s tier ii capital in non owner occupied cre loans secured by the real estate and another million or to non owner occupied cre developers property managers that is either secured by collateral other than commercial real estate or is unsecured 
at december   there were cre loans with an aggregate balance of million that have been identified as either non performing or potential problem loans 
at december   we had loans with million in total loan obligations or of the bank s tier ii capital to borrowers who operate in the hotel motel industry  including lodges  bed and breakfast inns  and a limited number of campgrounds 
at december   of the bank s largest hotel motel borrowers had loan obligations totaling million 
in addition  there were another hotel motel borrowers who had aggregate loan obligations of between million and million 
the hotel motel properties that we finance are geographically dispersed throughout our market area and the broader statewide region 
however  of the hotels motels bed breakfast inns we finance are located in the core market areas of cooperstown otsego county  oneonta otsego county  sidney delaware county  k 
index cobleskill schoharie county  and norwich chenango county  new york  with total loan obligations of approximately million 
many of these hotels inns are highly dependent upon tourism and have a seasonality that peaks in july and august 
at december   these loans were deemed to be of acceptable risk pass rated by our management  with no delinquency noted 
two loans in the hotel motel sector with an outstanding balance of million were risk rated as substandard at december  due to insufficient cash flow generated by the operations of the motels 
at december   loan obligations to the healthcare industry  including hospitals  medical practices  and residential and independent care facilities  totaled million or of the bank s tier ii capital 
this portfolio was comprised of approximately loans with an average size of thousand 
this portfolio presently contains of the largest borrowers in the bank with loan obligations totaling million 
all of these loans were pass rated at december  and were performing in compliance with contractual terms 
only loan obligation in this portfolio was identified as substandard at december  the borrower is a small hospital with an unused line of credit totaling thousand 
at december  we had loans with million of total loan obligations to borrowers who operate in the automotive and other vehicle dealership industry 
the total loan obligations to this industry sector represents of the bank s tier ii capital and consists of borrowers whose primary revenue is derived from the retail sale and service of new and used motor vehicles  motor cycles  and or recreational vehicles 
loans to this industry consist of commercial real estate mortgages  equipment financing  working capital lines of credit  and inventory lines dealer floor plans 
we maintain dealer floor plan lines within this portfolio totaling million  million of which was outstanding at december  due to the significant risk posed by dealer floor plan lending  management monitors the dealer floor plan loans by conducting inventory reviews on a monthly basis 
at december   there were three borrowers within this area of industry concentration with million in aggregate loan obligations outstanding that were classified as substandard 
the substantial majority of our loan obligations for this area of concentration were made to dealerships that primarily sell american automobiles 
in  american automobile manufacturers lost substantial market share to foreign automobile retailers 
at december   we had million in total loan obligations or of the bank s tier ii capital secured by residential rental properties  including family units  family units  and mobile home parks 
at december   the portfolio consisted of approximately loans with an average loan size of thousand 
the geographic location and types of properties securing this portfolio were fairly diverse 
five of the loans in this portfolio totaling thousand were classified as substandard at december  at december   we had borrowers whose total loan obligations were equal to or exceeded million 
in aggregate  these borrowers total loan obligations were million 
although these large relationships were dispersed among borrowers who operate in various industries  the decline in the financial condition of one of our large borrowers could significantly impact the credit quality of our loan portfolio 
at december   one of our large borrowers  with total loan obligations of million  was classified as substandard

the improvement in these credit quality measures were offset  in part  by an increase in non performing loans 
management and the board of directors deemed the allowance for loan losses as adequate at december  and december  allocation of the allowance for loan losses 
we allocate our allowance for loan losses among the loan categories indicated in the following table 
although we estimate and allocate probable losses by category of loan  this allocation should not be interpreted as the precise amount of future charge offs or a proportional distribution of future charge offs among loan categories 
additionally  since management regards the allowance for loan losses as a general balance  the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future charge offs that might occur within the designated categories

in order to operate the bank on a daily basis  it is necessary for us to maintain a limited amount of cash at our teller stations and within our vaults and atms to meet customers demands 
in addition  we always maintain an amount of check and other presentment items in the process of collection or float 
we are also required to maintain a clearing reserve balance at the federal reserve bank of new york and minimum target balances at our correspondent banks 
at december   we maintained million or of total assets in these categories of non earning assets

in may of  a senior executive of the bank unexpectedly passed away 
the bank held life insurance policies on the senior executive and received the full cash surrender value of these policies totaling thousand following his death 
this reduction in the cash surrender value of the bank owned life insurance was offset  in part  by an increase in the cash surrender value on the remaining policies and the senior executive s policies preceding his death totaling thousand 
the policies are issued by five life insurance companies who all carry strong financial strength ratings 
at december   the bank held policies on former and current members of the bank s senior management  all of whom participate in the bank s amended and restated split dollar life insurance plan as furnished in exhibit of this document

index pension asset 
on december   we adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  an accounting standard which requires employers to i recognize the over funded or under funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans  which is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation  as an asset or liability on its balance sheet  ii recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income  and iii measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of its year end balance sheet 
although we froze our defined pension plan on february   as the plan sponsor we maintain a requirement to fund the plan and comply with sfas no 
at december   our pension plan remained in an over funded status due to improved plan performance 
the pension asset at december  was million

several factors contributed to the net decrease in other assets between the periods including decreases in deferred taxes on investment securities  deferred tax asset on the pension plan and other assets  offset  in part  by increases in rejected check items  deferred federal income tax  software  prepaid dealer reserve and other real estate owned 
composition of liabilities deposits 
deposits are our primary funding source 
at december  and december  deposits represented approximately of our total liabilities 
total deposits at december  were million 
this compares to million at december   a million or increase 
the increase in total deposits between december  and december  was attributable to significant increases in money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit over and under thousand totaling million  offset  by decreases in savings accounts  now accounts  demand deposits and other deposits totaling million 
during  our depositors continued to transfer their funds to higher yield deposit accounts as interest rates on savings and now accounts remained low relative to money market and certificate of deposit interest rates

total borrowed funds consist of short term and long term borrowings 
short term borrowings include treasury  tax  and loan notes held for the benefit of the us treasury department  and securities sold under agreements to repurchase with our customers and other third parties 
long term borrowings consist of monies we borrowed from the fhlbny for various asset funding requirements and wholesale funding strategies 
total borrowed funds were million or of total liabilities at december   as compared to million or of total liabilities at december   a million or decrease between the periods 
short term borrowings decreased from million at december  to million at december   a million or decrease 
the decrease was principally due to a reduction in customer repurchase agreement balances 
during we repaid million of our long term borrowings at fhlbny as they amortized  matured or were called throughout the year 
these borrowings were replaced by new long term borrowings totaling million  which were used to fund newly originated and existing earning assets 
management did not increase long term borrowings during as loan growth was principally funded by a growth in deposits 
throughout most of  deposits were a less k 
index expensive funding source than long term borrowings 
in addition  due to a poor interest rate environment  in particular a flat or inverted yield curve  management did not execute any new wholesale leverage transactions during see note of the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item  of this document for additional detail on our borrowed funds

these improvements were offset by a thousand decrease in net interest income and an thousand increase in total non interest expense 
earnings per share improved from in to in  a or improvement 
throughout we operated in a difficult interest rate environment

these improvements were offset  in part  by decreases in commission income  net investment securities gains and other service fees 
during  we recorded a thousand deferred gain on the sale of the bank s norwich town branch building and contents and thousand in flood recovery grants 
during  non interest expense increased thousand or  from million in to million in most of the increase was due to an increase in our salaries and employee benefits totaling thousand 
during  we increased our full time equivalent employees by  from at december  to at december  due to our expansion efforts and the acquisition of provantage 
in addition  we provided merit based wage increases to most of our employees and increased commission and bonus payments to our sales force for increases in loan and deposit balances outstanding

average loans include loans held for sale  net deferred loan fees and costs  non accrual loans and excludes the allowance for loan losses 
net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest earning assets and the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin  also known as the net yield on average interest earning assets  represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
we recorded million of net interest income during this compares to million of net interest income during the thousand or decrease in net interest income between comparable periods was principally due to a significant increase in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities principally deposit funding  offset  in part  by increases in interest income on earning assets principally loans 
k 
index the level of our net interest income is dependent on several factors including  but not limited to our ability to attract and retain deposits  our ability to generate and retain loans  regional and local economic conditions  regional competition  capital market conditions  the national interest rate environment  as well as our tolerance for risk 
throughout and  our net interest income was affected by all of these factors  the most significant of which has been the general persistence of a flat or inverted yield curve 
a flat to inverted interest rate environment generally diminishes our ability to maintain or improve net interest margin because a portion of our net interest margin has historically been derived from mismatching long term earning assets with short term interest bearing liabilities 
between and  total interest and dividend income increased million or  from million during to million during the weighted average yield on loans  investment securities and interest bearing deposits at other banks increased between and during the first three quarters of  maturing earning assets were generally replaced with new assets originated at higher rates of interest 
in addition  during the first three quarters of most variable rate earning assets reset at higher rates of interest due to an increase in the index interest rate between periodic re pricing dates 
the average yield on federal funds sold decreased between and  due principally to a basis point drop in the federal funds target rate during the last four months of the average yield on loans  our largest earning asset portfolio  increased five basis points between and  from in to in although the prime rate remained unchanged at throughout most of  the average yield on our loans increased 
a significant portion of our variable rate loans are indexed to the prime rate or other market interest rate  but only reset on a pre determined periodic basis such as the anniversary date of the loan 
this condition delays the impact interest rate changes have on our loan portfolio yield 
for this reason  the prime rate increases experienced in the first two quarters of did not fully impact loan yields until subsequent quarters 
the increase in loan yields  coupled with an increase in the average volume of loans outstanding between comparable periods  resulted in a million increase in interest income on loans 
interest income on loans totaled million in  as compared to million in the average loans outstanding increased from million in to million in the average yield on loans began to decline during the fourth quarter of  as the prime interest rate decreased basis points between september  and december  the prime rate at december  decreased to 
this compares to on september  the average yield on the securities portfolio increased basis points between and  from in to in during  the proceeds of maturing  sold  or called investment securities were reinvested in higher yield instruments 
although this activity helped improve interest income between comparable years  it was offset  in part  by a reduction in the average volume of securities we maintained in our investment portfolio 
between and  we maintained an increased level of federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits at other banks to help manage interest rate and liquidity risk and were successful in increasing average loans outstanding 
the basis point increase in the average yield on the investment securities portfolio  offset by a reduction in the average outstanding balance of the portfolio  resulted in a net increase in interest income on securities of thousand between and interest income on securities increased from million in to million in to manage interest rate risk and liquidity risk  we increased our average outstanding balance in federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits at other banks between and in particular  the average volume of federal funds sold increased million  from million in to million in the average yield on the federal funds sold portfolio decreased basis points between comparable periods due principally to a basis point decrease in the target federal funds rate during the fourth quarter of the increase in the volume of federal funds sold  offset  in part by a decrease in the yield on federal funds sold resulted in a thousand improvement in interest income on federal funds sold between and interest income recorded on federal funds sold during was thousand  as compared to thousand during we recorded thousand of interest income on interest bearing deposits during  as compared to thousand during  a thousand increase 
we increased the volume of interest bearing deposits between comparable periods to mitigate interest rate risk and liquidity risk 
in addition  the yield on this portfolio increased from during to during due to higher market interest rates 
interest expense increased million  or  between and we recorded total interest expense of million in  as compared to million during the increase in interest expense between the periods was due to two primary factors 
first  between comparable periods  a significant portion of the certificate of deposit portfolio matured 
these funds  along with funds from new depositors  were often reinvested in new certificates of deposit  generally at higher rates of interest 
this increased interest expense on time and other deposit accounts from million to million in  a million or increase 
second  we recorded million of interest expense on our money market deposit accounts during this compares to million during  a k 
index million or increase between the periods 
throughout and we offered and promoted to customers our wealth management money market deposit account 
the account provided depositors with a interest rate throughout and most of it was offered to remain competitive with other financial institutions in our market 
as expected  our existing deposit customers and new deposit customers transferred their funds into this account  raising the average balance in our money market deposit accounts from million in to million in  a million or increase 
at december   the treasury yield curve was modestly sloped with a slight inversion in the year and year maturity timeframe 
the day treasury bill  the year treasury note and the year treasury note were yielding  and  respectively 
this interest rate environment inhibits our ability to earn net interest income  since we typically earn a portion of our net interest income by procuring short term to mid term deposits and borrowings and investing those proceeds in longer term loans and investments 
this practice  which is sometimes referred to as mismatching assets and liabilities  typically allows banks to enhance their interest spread  which generates net interest income 
since december   the federal open market committee decreased the target federal funds rate an additional basis points to 
this prompted banks  including us  to correspondingly lower their prime rate of interest to 
in addition  the treasury yield curve generally decreased to basis points due to concerns about general weakness in the national economy 
this interest environment will continue to make it difficult for us to improve net interest spread for several quarters prospectively since much of our loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate and our federal funds sold position generally exceeds million

interest income increased million between the and  due to both a net increase in the rate and volume of earning assets 
the yield on interest bearing deposits  securities and loans all increased between and  while the yield on federal funds sold decreased 
similarly  the volume of federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits and loans increased between comparable periods  while the average volume of investment securities decreased 
on a combined basis  the rate improvement on earning assets contributed an additional thousand of interest income between comparable years  while the net increase in the volume of earning assets contributed million of additional interest income 
of the million increase in interest income between and  million or of the total increase was due to an increase in interest income on loans 
between comparable periods  the average volume of loans outstanding increased million  due principally to loan growth in our newer markets 
the growth in the volume of loans between comparable years contributed million of the million improvement in interest income on loans 
in addition  between the comparable periods  existing variable rate loans generally re priced at higher rates of interest  helping to increase the yield on loans by basis points from in to in the increase in the rate on loans between comparable periods contributed thousand of the million increase in interest income on loans between comparable periods 
due to the increasing interest rate risk associated with building the loan portfolio  particularly longer term fixed rate loans  an increase in the volatility of deposit funding  and the persistence of a flat or inverted yield curve throughout most of  we increased our average outstanding balance in federal funds sold between comparable years 
during  we maintained an average federal funds sold position of million 
this compares to million in the increase in the volume of federal funds sold between and contributed additional interest income totaling thousand 
during the fourth quarter of  the average yield on federal funds dropped significantly as the federal open market committee dropped the target federal funds rate to provide stimulus to the national economy 
the action of the federal open market committee helped drive down our average yield on federal funds sold to for this compares to in  a basis point decrease 
the decrease in the average yield on federal funds reduced interest income thousand between comparable periods 
interest income on the securities portfolio increased thousand between and to help fund loan growth  an increased federal funds sold position  and a higher interest bearing deposits position  we reduced the size of our investment securities portfolio between comparable periods 
during  the average outstanding balance of the investment securities portfolio was million 
this compares to million during  a million or k 
index decrease 
the decrease in the average outstanding balance of investment securities between periods negatively impacted interest income by thousand 
this was offset  however  by an increase in interest income on securities due to rate totaling thousand 
the million increase in interest income between and was negated by a million increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  million of which was due to the increase in rate and million of which was due to the increase in the volume of interest bearing liabilities 
the interest expense recorded on our most interest sensitive liabilities  including time and other deposit accounts and money market accounts  increased due to both an increase in volume and an increase in rate 
interest expense on time and other deposit accounts increased million between and between comparable years  we raised the interest rates paid on certificates of deposit 
this was done to remain competitive with local bank competition and to match market increases in short term interest rates  particularly for jumbo certificates of deposit over 
this action increased the cost of time and other deposit accounts  resulting in a million increase in interest expense due to rate 
the remaining increase in interest expense on time and other deposit accounts between the periods  totaling thousand  was due to an increase in volume as depositors transferred their monies from low rate interest bearing deposit or demand deposit accounts to higher yield certificates of deposit 
as short term interest rates increased during the first half of  we raised the interest rate to on all tiers of our wealth management money market deposit account 
although we believe this helped us retain existing depositors funds and attract new depositors  it caused a significant increase in interest expense on money market accounts 
interest expense on money market deposit accounts increased million between and the average rate paid on our money market deposit accounts increased from for to for  while the average outstanding volume of money market deposit accounts increased from million to million over the same periods 
of the million increase in interest expense on money market deposit accounts  million was due to an increase in volume and thousand was due to an increase in rate 
during the first nine months of  there was a general rise in short term interest rates 
this caused some of our customers with now account deposits to either move their monies to another institution or transfer their now account funds to a less liquid  higher rate deposit account 
this decreased the average volume of now accounts between the periods from million in to million in the decrease in the average volume of now account deposits reduced interest expense thousand between comparable periods 
this improvement was offset  in part  by a thousand increase in interest expense on now account deposits due to a basis point increase in the average rate paid between the periods 
the weighted average rate paid on savings accounts was for  as compared to for the low interest rate being offered on savings accounts caused depositors to reduce their savings deposits and decreased the average volume of savings deposits between the periods 
the interest expense recorded on savings accounts due to changes in volume decreased thousand between and the basis point drop in the average rate paid on savings accounts between the periods further reduced interest expense thousand between and the interest expense on borrowings decreased thousand between and between comparable periods  lower cost borrowings were replaced by higher cost borrowings as they matured 
this increased borrowing costs from in to in  causing a thousand increase in interest expense on borrowings due to rate 
due to the increased borrowing rates and the flat to inverted yield curve throughout the comparable periods  we reduced average borrowings 
specifically  average outstanding borrowings decreased from million in to million in the decrease in the average outstanding balance of borrowed funds reduced interest expense on borrowings due to volume by thousand between comparable years 
provision for loan losses 
we recorded thousand in the provision for loan losses during this compares to million for the thousand or decrease in the provision for loan losses between comparable periods was principally caused by a reduction in potential problem loans  delinquent loans  and net charge offs  offset  in part  by an increase in non performing loans 
at december  we had identified million in potential problem loans 
by comparison  at december   potential problem loans totaled million  a million or decrease 
net charge offs for were thousand  as compared to million for loans to days delinquent decreased from million at december  to million at december  non performing loans totaled million at december  as compared to million at december   a million increase between the periods 
non interest income 
non interest income is comprised of trust fees  service charges on deposit accounts  commission income  net investment security gains  net gain on sale of loans  income and gains on bank owned life insurance  other k 
index service fees  and other income 
non interest income improved significantly between and in particular  total non interest income increased from million in to million in  a million or increase 
the significant increase in non interest income between and principally due to three unusual events i a thousand gain on life insurance coverage due to the death of a senior executive of the company  ii the recording of new york state flood grant proceeds during totaling thousand  and iii the recognition of a thousand deferred gain on the sale of our norwich town branch building and related equipment to the site s landowner 
in addition  between comparable periods we recorded increases in trust fees  service charges on deposit accounts  net gain on sale of loans  and bank owned life insurance income totaling thousand 
these improvements were offset  in part  by decreases in commission income  investment security gains net  and other service fees totaling thousand 
trust fees increased thousand or between and during  we recorded million in trust fees as compared to million in during  we recorded account termination and executor fees totaling thousand 
by comparison  during we recorded account termination and executor fees totaling thousand  a thousand increase between the years 
trust fees recorded for routine account administration  custodial services and investment management excluding account termination and executor fees decreased thousand between the periods  from million in to million in during we recorded million of service charges on deposit accounts 
this compares to million in service charges on deposit accounts during  a thousand or increase 
the net increase in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily due to an increase in penalty charges on checking accounts 
during the first quarter of we began offering our courtesy overdraft service to more of our checking account customers  causing an increase in the product s usage and improving deposit service fees 
penalty charges on checking accounts increased thousand between and  from thousand during to million during our commission income is generated from the bank s insurance agency subsidiary  mang wilber llc 
during  we recorded commission income totaling thousand 
this compares to thousand in commission income during  an thousand or decrease 
mang wilber  llc owns two thirds of a specialty lines property and casualty agency located in clifton park  new york saratoga county 
this agency did not perform well in  as compared to  and was largely responsible for the decrease in commission income period over period 
during  we recorded net investment security gains totaling thousand  thousand of which was due to an increase in the value of our trading securities portfolio and thousand of which was attributable to gains on the sale of available for sale investment securities 
our trading securities portfolio consists of equity and debt securities held by the company s executive deferred compensation plan 
by comparison  during we recorded thousand in net investment security gains  a thousand decrease period over period 
during  we received proceeds from the sale and maturity of available for sale investment securities totaling million  which generated thousand in net gains during the period 
during that same period  our trading securities generated net gains of thousand 
during the first quarter of we acquired provantage  a new york state licensed mortgage banker  to gain a foothold in the new york state capital district market and provide additional residential mortgage options to our borrowers 
provantage sells a significant portion of its originated loans to third party financial institutions in the normal course of its business 
during  we recorded a thousand net gain on the sale of these loans 
this compares to no loans sold during during  we recorded a thousand increase in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance 
this compares to thousand during  a thousand or increase 
between comparable periods  our insurance carriers raised their net crediting rates on bank owned life insurance contracts 
other service fees are comprised of numerous types of fee income including merchant credit card processing fees  commissions on residential mortgages  official check and check cashing fees  travelers check sales  wire transfer fees  letter of credit fees  us government bond sales  certificate of deposit account registry service fees  and other miscellaneous service charges and fees 
other service fees decreased thousand or between and the decrease in other service fees between the periods was principally due to the decrease in residential mortgage commissions 
during  we originated residential mortgages as an agent for a large regional bank based in the southeast 
in the first quarter of  we acquired provantage and terminated our agency relationship with the large regional bank 
this reduced residential mortgage commissions from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand decrease 
other income is comprised of numerous types of fee income including investment services income  lease income  safe deposit box income  gain on sale of fixed assets  title insurance agency income  and income from the rental of foreclosed real estate 
other income increased from thousand in to million in  a thousand or k

in the first quarter of  we recorded a thousand deferred gain on the sale of our norwich town branch building and related equipment to the site s landowner 
there were no similar transactions recorded in in addition  during  we received thousand in flood grant proceeds from new york state 
these grants were provided to assist us with our flood recovery efforts due to a regional flood in non interest expense 
non interest expense is comprised of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  computer service fees  advertising and marketing expense  professional fees  and other miscellaneous expenses 
non interest expense increased thousand or between an  from million in to million in increases in salaries  employee benefits  furniture and equipment expense  advertising and marketing  professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses totaling thousand  were offset  in part  by a modest decrease in occupancy expense and computer service fees totaling thousand 
salaries expense increased thousand or between and  from million in to million in the increase between comparable periods was due to a thousand increase in base salaries and overtime less deferred amounts  a thousand increase in commission and incentive payments and a thousand decrease in deferred compensation expenses 
during the first quarter of  we acquired provantage and provided general merit related pay raises to our employees 
our full time equivalent employee base also increased from at december  to at december  due to these factors  we recorded a thousand increase in base salaries and overtime in during and  we had in place various commission and incentive plans for our sales and support staff to grow our loan and deposit portfolios and improve the company s net income 
during  we recorded thousand in salaries expense due to these commission and incentive plans  as compared to thousand in  a thousand or increase 
and finally  the salaries expense related to the company s executive deferred compensation plan decreased thousand between and  from thousand in to thousand in due principally to weaker performance of the investments held for the benefit of the company s deferred compensation accounts 
employee benefits expense increased modestly between and we recorded employee benefits expense of million in  as compared to million in  a thousand or increase 
during  we recorded thousand of expense associated with the bank s defined benefit retirement plan 
in february  we froze the plan s benefits 
in addition  the plan s assets have performed well in recent years 
due to these factors  we recorded a thousand credit on the defined benefit retirement plan during  reducing employee benefits expense by thousand 
this reduction in benefits expense was offset by a significant increase in employee health insurance costs totaling thousand  a thousand increase in fica expense and a thousand increase in other benefits 
during we experienced a significant increase in claims on the bank s partially self insured health plan and assumed the costs associated with the provantage health insurance plan resulting in a thousand increase in total health insurance expense between comparable periods 
fica expense increased thousand between and due to increases in salaries expense 
and finally  other benefits expense increased thousand between and  due principally to an increase in the liability associated with the bank s supplemental executive retirement plan for two retired executives 
during  we recorded million in occupancy expense for the company s premises 
this compares to million during  a thousand or decrease 
in the third quarter of  we incurred significant occupancy expenses due to business resumption costs associated with restoring banking services after our market area was severely impacted by regional flooding 
in particular  during the third quarter of we leased bank in the box trailers to restore banking services at our sidney  ny and walton  ny locations 
in addition to incurring the costs associated with establishing and leasing these temporary banking facilities  we also incurred significant costs related to cleaning and dehumidifying our offices directly affected by flooding 
similar expenses were not incurred in during we recorded furniture and equipment expense totaling thousand  as compared to thousand during  a thousand or increase 
between comparable periods we recorded a thousand increase in depreciation expense on furniture and equipment  due principally to increased technology demands and related computer equipment purchases 
computer service fees decreased thousand or between and  from thousand in to thousand in between the comparable periods  we engaged a new atm network provider and successfully reduced atm vendor fees by thousand 
this decrease was offset  in part  by a thousand net increase in various other components of computer service fees 
advertising and marketing expenses increased significantly between and in particular  advertising and marketing expenses increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or increase 
during the fourth quarter of  we engaged an advertising and marketing firm to assist us in improving the k 
index company s brand image 
the increase in marketing fees between and was due  in part  to the costs associated with this project  as well as increased radio  newspaper and television advertising placements to support our company wide sales efforts 
professional fees increased from thousand in to thousand in  an thousand or increase 
in we hired recruiting firms to assist us in hiring professionals for certain key administrative and sales positions with the company

earnings per share were in  as compared to in  a decrease between the periods 
our return on average assets declined from in to in similarly  our return on average shareholders equity also declined from in to in a decrease in net interest income and an increase in non interest expense were partially offset by a slight decrease in the provision for loan losses  an increase in non interest income and a decrease in income taxes between the periods 
k 
index throughout the yield curve was flat or inverted 
this poor interest rate climate made it difficult for us to increase net interest income  particularly when earning assets were not growing significantly 
like most community banks  our bank earns some portion of its income by mismatching short term liabilities with longer term earning assets 
our net interest income decreased thousand or  from million in to million in during  the yield on our loan portfolio increased significantly as our variable rate loans repriced at higher interest rates due to increases in short term interest rates during the first half of the year 
the increase in loan yields was offset by significant increases in interest expense on time and other deposit accounts and money market accounts 
the increase in short term interest rates drove up the cost of time accounts  particularly certificates of deposit  and caused a shift of non maturity deposit balances from low cost savings and now accounts to higher cost money market accounts 
between and  interest income on loans increased million  while the interest expense on money market and time and other deposit accounts increased million 
during non interest expense increased significantly 
we incurred million of non interest expense in  as compared to million in  a million or increase 
during the second quarter of our market area was affected by a regional flood  which substantially damaged two of our branch offices  namely our sidney  new york and walton  new york branch offices 
the damages  related clean up and recovery charges caused us to record approximately thousand of unanticipated non interest expense 
salaries expense increased from million in to million in  a thousand or increase 
in we raised employee salaries and commission payments for additional responsibilities and performance 
we also increased staff to meet our regulatory compliance obligations and satisfy our expansion efforts 
professional fees also increased significantly between the periods  from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or increase 
the company s common stock self tender offer in the second quarter of and the outsourcing of our internal audit function were the primary contributors to the increase 
the negative impact of a poor interest rate environment  the regional flood and the increase in salaries expense  was partially mitigated by an increase in non interest income 
non interest income increased from million in to million in  a thousand or increase 
the increase was attributable to several factors  including a thousand increase in trust fees and a thousand increase in other income between the periods 
the decrease in income before tax between and reduced income tax expense 
we recorded million of income taxes in  versus million in  a thousand or decrease 
net interest income 
net interest income is our most significant source of net revenue net interest income plus non interest income 
during  net interest income comprised of our total revenues 
the other was due to non interest income 
this compares to and  respectively  for the asset and yield summary table  interest rate table and rate and volume table provided in item d 
i 
above  and the associated narrative that follows provide detailed net interest income information and analysis that are important to understanding our results of operations 
between and  net interest income decreased thousand or 
this decrease was due to a significant increase in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities principally deposit funding offset  in part  by increases in interest income on earning assets principally loans 
in june the federal open market committee raised the target federal funds rate from to 
this represented the seventeenth consecutive basis point increase in the target federal funds rate over a year period 
these actions  coupled with modest inflation expectations and a strong international appetite for us treasury securities during this time span resulted in a very flat  and at times  inverted yield curve throughout  an interest rate environment which made it difficult for us to maintain or improve net interest margin 
historically  a portion of our net interest income has been earned from mismatching long term earning assets with short term interest bearing liabilities 
additionally  the higher interest rates during curbed the demand for new loans  which limited our ability to improve interest income 
average loans outstanding increased only modestly between and specifically  average loans outstanding increased million or between the periods  from million in to million in between and  total interest and dividend income increased million or  from million in to million in most of the increase was due to an increase in the average yield on loans 
between and  the weighted average yield on the loan portfolio increased basis points  from to 
this contributed million of additional interest income between comparable periods 
this represents of the net increase in interest income between and during and  the prime rate  the primary index rate for our k 
index variable rate loans  increased significantly 
at january   the prime rate was  as compared to at december   a basis point increase during the two year period 
the increase in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  between the periods also increased our average yield on federal funds sold from in to in and our average yield on our investment securities portfolio from in to in the increase in the federal funds interest rate and the shorter average maturity on our deposit liabilities prompted us to increase the amount of federal funds sold during we maintained million of average federal funds sold in  as compared to million in the net increase in interest income due to a higher federal funds rate and improved investment securities yields contributed an additional thousand of interest income between the periods 
interest income on federal funds sold increased thousand between the periods  from thousand in to thousand in  while interest income on our securities portfolio increased thousand  from million in to million in these increases in interest income were offset by a decrease in the average volume and average yield on interest bearing deposits held at other banks 
during and  we had several certificates of deposit at other financial institutions mature 
this caused a decrease in the average balance and average rate in this category of earning assets from million and in to million and in  respectively 
although there was a modest decrease in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities between and  the shift from lower cost deposits to higher cost deposits raised the average cost of interest bearing liabilities from in to in and increased interest expense million or 
interest expense for was million  as compared to million in between the comparable periods and there was a general increase in the level of interest rates 
this prompted us  as well as our competitors  to raise the interest rate paid on interest bearing deposit accounts  particularly the more interest sensitive deposit accounts  such as money market accounts and time accounts 
between the periods we recorded a million net increase in the cost of interest bearing deposit liabilities due to increase in interest rates 
in addition  due to the higher interest rates  our customers increased the amount of deposits held in money market and time and other deposit accounts 
the increased volume in these accounts contributed an additional million of interest expense between comparable periods 
the flat to inverted yield curve that persisted throughout effectively eliminated wholesale leverage opportunities and reduced the economic benefit of borrowing funds throughout the year  causing us to reduce borrowings and  in turn  our earning assets 
during our total borrowings averaged million 
this compares to average borrowings of million during  a million or decrease between the periods 
the decrease in average borrowings  offset by an increase in borrowing rates  resulted in a net decrease in interest expense on borrowings of thousand between the periods 
at december  the treasury yield curve was slightly inverted 
the day treasury bill was yielding and the year treasury note was yielding 
this interest rate environment inhibited our ability to earn net interest income  since banks typically earn net interest income by procuring short term deposits and borrowings and investing those proceeds in longer term loans and investments 
this practice  which is sometimes referred to as mismatching assets and liabilities  typically allows banks to enhance their interest spread  which generates net interest income

index rate and volume analysis net interest income was million in this compares to million in  a thousand or decrease between comparable periods 
although the decrease in net interest income between comparable periods was not drastic  several components of interest income and interest expense changed significantly between the periods due to both rate and volume factors 
interest income increased million between the periods due principally to an increase in the rate on earning assets 
as interest rates rose between and the yield on federal funds sold  securities  and loans all increased 
together  the rate improvement on these three categories of earning assets contributed an additional million of interest income between comparable periods 
this was offset by a thousand decrease in interest income on interest bearing deposits due to a change in rate between the periods 
between and the average yield on our loan portfolio increased basis points  from in to in this increase contributed million of additional interest income during or of the total increase in interest income due to rate between the periods 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate 
as the prime rate increased during and the first six month of  the yield on our variable rate loan portfolio climbed 
the million net improvement in interest income on earning assets due to a change in rate between the periods was offset  in part  by a thousand net reduction in interest income due to a decrease in the average volume of earning assets 
during  our average earning assets were million  which compares to million during the average volume of interest bearing deposits and securities decreased between the comparable periods  while the average volume of federal funds sold and loans increased slightly 
the decrease in the average volume of interest bearing deposits and securities reduced interest income by thousand between comparable periods 
this was offset  in part  by a thousand increase in interest income between comparable periods due to an increase in the average volume of federal fund sold and loans outstanding 
the million increase in interest income between and was offset by a million increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  million due to the increase in rate and thousand due to the increase in the volume of interest bearing liabilities 
the interest expense recorded on our most interest sensitive liabilities  including time and other deposits accounts and money market accounts  increased due to both an increase in volume and an increase in rate 
specifically  interest expense on time and other deposit accounts and interest expense on money market accounts increased million and million  respectively  over the comparable periods 
between the comparable periods  we raised the interest rates paid on our certificates of deposit to remain competitive within our market 
this drove up the cost of time and other deposit accounts resulting in a million increase in interest expense due to changes in rate 
the remaining increase in interest expense on time and other deposit accounts between the periods totaling thousand was due to an increase in volume as depositors transferred their monies from low rate interest bearing deposit or demand deposit accounts to higher yield certificates of deposit 
money market accounts experienced similar results 
as interest rates increased between the periods  we raised the interest rates paid on our money market deposits  which increased interest expense thousand on a comparable period basis 
the higher interest rates attracted additional deposits  which resulted in an increase in interest expense due to a change in volume of thousand 
the average cost of our money market deposit accounts increased basis points between comparable periods  from in to in  while the average volume of money market deposit accounts increased from million to million over the same periods 
as short term interest rates increased rapidly between the periods  we only modestly increased the interest rate on our now account deposits 
this caused some of our customers with now account deposits to either move their monies to another institution or transfer their now account funds to a higher rate deposit account 
this decreased the average volume of now accounts between the periods from million in to million in the decrease in the average volume of now account deposits reduced interest expense by thousand between comparable periods 
this was offset  however  by a thousand increase in interest expense on now account deposits due to a basis point increase in the average rate paid between the periods 
in spite of rising interest rates between periods  we modestly reduced the average rate paid on our savings accounts from in to in the low interest rate being offered on savings accounts caused depositors to reduce their savings deposits and decreased the average volume of savings deposits between the periods 
the interest expense recorded on savings accounts decreased thousand between and  thousand due to a decrease in average volume and thousand due to a decrease in rate 
the interest expense on borrowings decreased thousand between and due principally to the repayment of borrowed funds 
between the comparable periods  the average volume of borrowings decreased by million  resulting in a thousand decrease in interest expense due to changes in volume 
this was offset  in part  by a thousand increase in interest expense on borrowings between comparable periods due to higher interest rates 
k 
index provision for loan losses 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million in  as compared to million in  a thousand decrease 
during some of our credit quality measures worsened  while others improved 
in particular  between the periods we experienced a significant increase in potential problem loans 
during the first quarter of  we downgraded some of our large commercial credits  which increased the level of potential problem loans from million or of loans outstanding at december  to million or of loans outstanding at march  at december  this level remained high at million or of loans outstanding 
in addition  loans to days delinquent totaled million or of loans outstanding at december  this increased to million or of loans outstanding at december  additional increases in the provision for loan losses were mitigated by a decrease in non performing loans between december  and december  and a declining level of net charge offs during the last three quarters of non performing loans decreased from million or of loans outstanding at december  to million or of loans outstanding at december  although net charge offs increased thousand or between comparable twelve month periods  the trend during the last three quarters of were favorable 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a thousand charge off of one borrower s loans with us  for which an allowance for loan losses had been previously allocated 
this comprised of our net charge offs 
during the last three quarters of  we recorded net charge offs of thousand 
this compares to million of net charge offs during the last three quarters of non interest income 
non interest income is comprised of trust fees  service charges on deposit accounts  commissions income  investment security gains losses  income on bank owned life insurance  other service fees  and other income 
non interest income increased thousand or in  from million in to million in the net increase in non interest income on a comparable period basis was due to net increases in trust fees  service charges on deposit accounts  net investment securities gains  bank owned life insurance income and other income  offset  in part  by a decrease in commission income and other services fees 
trust fees increased from million in to million in  a thousand or increase between the periods 
during  executor and account closing fees increased thousand or due to the closing of several large estates and accounts 
executor and account closing fees totaled thousand in  as compared to thousand in fees on retained trust  investment management and custodial accounts remained relatively unchanged year over year 
during we recorded million of service charges on deposit accounts 
this compares to million during  a thousand or increase 
during the third quarter of we reduced or eliminated select demand deposit and now account service charges to retain and attract new transaction accounts 
the decrease in service fees on these accounts between comparable periods was offset by a thousand increase in atm fees between the comparable periods 
during we raised the fee we charge non customers to use our atm network 
the increase in this fee was the primary reason our atm fees increased during during we recognized net investment securities gains of thousand 
this compares to thousand during  a thousand or increase between the periods 
the increase in net investment securities gains between the periods was due to two factors an thousand increase in gains of trading securities  offset by a thousand decrease in gains on the sale and maturity of available for sale investment securities 
during we recorded a net gain of thousand on our trading securities portfolio 
this compares to a thousand net gain in our trading securities portfolio consists of equity and debt securities held for the company s executive deferred compensation plan 
the securities held by this plan performed better in than in during we received proceeds from the sale and maturity of available for sale investment securities totaling million 
this generated net investment securities gains of thousand 
by comparison  during we received proceeds from the sale and maturity of available for sale investment securities totaling million  which generated net investment securities gains of thousand 
we hold life insurance policies on the lives of sixteen active and former executives of the company 
the cash surrender value of these policies totaled million at december  although we did not purchase any additional policies in  the income on these policies increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or increase due to a modest increase in the net crediting amount provided by our insurance carriers 
other income is comprised of numerous types of fee income  including investment services  lease income  safe deposit box income  title insurance agency income  rental of bank real estate  and distributions from two insurance trusts  in which the bank participates 
other income increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand k 
index or increase 
the increase between the periods was due to several factors 
in the second quarter of  we recorded thousand of other income due to the unanticipated recovery on a defaulted investment security 
between comparable periods we recorded a thousand increase in investment services income due to increased investment service sales 
during the third quarter of  we sold a small parcel of land and house adjacent to one of our branch offices generating a thousand gain on the sale 
and finally  during the fourth quarter we received a thousand net incentive payment from our atm network provider to convert our atm network 
these increases were offset  in part  by a decrease in certain components of other income  including a thousand decrease in rental income and a thousand decrease in income from a title insurance agency in which we hold an ownership interest 
other service fees are comprised of numerous types of fee income including merchant credit card processing fees  residential mortgage commissions  official check and check cashing fees  travelers check sales  wire transfer fees  letter of credit fees  and other miscellaneous service charges commissions and fees 
other service fees decreased thousand or between and the decrease in other service fees between the periods was principally due to the decrease in residential mortgage commissions 
we originate residential mortgage loans as an agent for a super regional bank located in the southeastern united states 
during the regional housing market slowed and mortgage interest rates increased 
due to these factors we originated less mortgages under our agency arrangement during  as compared to as a result  during we recorded thousand of residential mortgage commissions  as compared to thousand in  a thousand or decrease 
our commission income is generated from the bank s insurance agency subsidiary  mang wilber llc 
during we recorded thousand of commission income 
this compares to thousand in an increase in commission income from our oneonta  new york and walton  new york locations was offset by a significant decrease in commission income from our specialty lines agency located in clifton park  new york 
non interest expense 
non interest expense is comprised of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  computer service fees  advertising and marketing expense  professional fees  and other miscellaneous expense 
total non interest expense increased million or on a comparable period basis  from million in to million in between comparable periods  most categories of non interest expense increased with the exception of employee benefits cost and advertising and marketing expense 
salaries expense increased thousand or between the comparable periods  from million in to million in the increase between periods was due to increases in all three components of salary expense  namely base salaries and overtime  commission and incentive amounts and deferred compensation expense 
base salaries and overtime increased thousand or between the periods  from million in to million in  due to an increase in staff and general increases in base salary amounts 
commission and incentive payments increased thousand between the periods  from thousand in to thousand in and finally  the salaries expense related to the company s executive deferred compensation plan increased thousand between the periods  from thousand in to thousand in due principally to the improved performance of the investments held for the benefit of the deferred compensation accounts 
we recorded employee benefits expense of million in this compares to million in the net decrease in employee benefits expense between comparable periods totaling thousand or was due to several factors 
in the first quarter of  we froze our defined benefit pension plan and began making employer contributions to our k retirement plan 
due principally to the curtailment charge on the frozen defined benefit plan  we recorded a net increase in retirement benefits expense defined benefit pension expense and k retirement expense of thousand between comparable periods 
retirement benefits expense increased from thousand in to thousand in fica expense  group life insurance  group disability insurance  unemployment insurance  workers compensation and employee education expense each increased between comparable periods  combining for an additional thousand of benefits expense 
the increase in these costs were offset by a thousand decrease in other benefits due  principally  to a reduction in the amount recorded to fund the company s supplemental executive retirement plan for two retired executives 
in addition  our group health insurance expense decreased thousand between comparable periods due to favorable claims experience 
occupancy expense increased thousand or between and occupancy expense totaled million in  as compared to million in the increase was substantially due to a regional flood  which caused us to temporarily close our walton and sidney  new york branch offices  while a third office  our main office  was modestly damaged due to water intrusion 
we incurred significant costs in to clean up each of these offices 
in addition  we entered into two lease agreements with a third party  to rent bank in a box temporary banking facilities in the walton and sidney markets 
k 
index computer service fees increased thousand or between and we recorded thousand of computer service fees in  as compared to thousand in the increase between the periods can be primarily attributed to a core computer system conversion completed during the third quarter of we converted our proprietary core computer operating system to a system more widely used throughout the banking industry 
to operate the new system we entered into various software licensing agreements and maintenance contracts with several hardware and software computer system vendors  resulting in an increase in computer service fees 
furniture and equipment expense also increased thousand or between periods  from thousand in to thousand in the increase was primarily due to an increase in expenditures on computer equipment related to the core system conversion 
professional fees increased thousand or between comparable periods  from thousand in to thousand in the increase in professional fees was due to a couple of significant factors 
in april we announced a self tender offer for the company s common stock 
to complete the offer we recorded thousand of legal and other professional fees 
in addition  in we engaged a regional accounting firm to perform our internal audit function 
this increased professional fees thousand over comparable periods 
these increases were reduced by a thousand net decrease in other components of legal and professional fees 
other miscellaneous expenses include directors fees  fidelity insurance  the bank s occ assessment  fdic premiums and assessments  bad debt collection expenses  correspondent bank services  service expenses related to the bank s accounts receivable financing services  charitable donations and customer relations  other losses  dues and memberships  office supplies  postage and shipping  subscriptions  telephone expense  employee travel and entertainment  software amortization  intangible asset amortization expense  oreo expenses  minority interest expense  stock exchange listing fees  loss on disposal impairment of fixed assets and several other miscellaneous expenses

income taxes 
income tax expense decreased from million in to million in  a thousand or decrease between the periods 
the decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a decreased amount of k 
index pre tax income 
our effective tax rate decreased from in to in due to a greater percentage of our pre tax income being generated from tax exempt securities and bank owned life insurance 
e 
liquidity liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations in the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers  to fund loans to customers  and to fund our current and planned expenditures 
we are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position 
accordingly  we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis through our daily funds management process 
this includes maintaining the appropriate levels of currency throughout our branch system to meet the daily cash needs of our customers  balancing our mandated deposit or reserve requirements at the federal reserve bank of new york  maintaining adequate cash balances at our correspondent banks  and assuring that adequate levels of federal funds sold  liquid assets  and borrowing resources are available to meet obligations  including reasonably anticipated daily fluctuations 
the following list represents the sources of funds available to meet our liquidity requirements 
our primary sources of funds are denoted by an asterisk 
source of funding currency federal reserve and correspondent bank balances federal funds sold loan and investment principal and interest payments investment security maturities and calls demand deposits and now accounts savings and money market deposits certificates of deposit and other time deposits repurchase agreements fhlbny advances lines of credit sale of available for sale investment securities brokered deposits correspondent lines of credit federal reserve discount window borrowings sale of loans proceeds from issuance of equity securities branch acquisition cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance in addition to the daily funds management process  we also monitor certain liquidity ratios and complete a liquidity assessment on a monthly basis 
the monthly evaluation report  known as the liquidity contingency scorecard  is reviewed by the alco and the bank s board of directors 
the report provides management with various ratios and financial market data that are compared to limits established within the bank s asset and liability management policy 
it was designed to provide an early warning signal of a potential liquidity crisis 
based on the limits established in our asset and liability management policy  we determined that at december  the bank was in a b liquidity position  the second strongest liquidity position based on management s internal rating system 
this compares to a a liquidity position at december   the strongest liquidity position based on management s internal rating system 
k 
index the following table summarizes several of our key liquidity measures for the periods stated table of liquidity measures liquidity measure december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents available for sale investment securities at estimated fair value less securities pledged for state and municipal deposits and borrowings total loan to total asset ratio fhlbny remaining borrowing capacity available correspondent bank lines of credit although our overall liquidity position diminished modestly between december  and december   we maintained adequate amounts of cash and cash equivalents at december  to meet anticipated short term funding needs 
in addition  our ability to meet unanticipated funding needs was strong 
at december   we maintained million of available for sale investment securities that could be pledged for borrowings or sold to meet unanticipated funding needs 
this compares to million at december  our fhlbny borrowing capacity decreased from million at december  to million at december   a million decrease 
during  we procured long term borrowings at the fhlbny to fund an increase in our loans outstanding 
in addition to these sources of liquidity  at december  and december  we maintained a million unsecured credit facility at a correspondent bank in the event we needed to borrow federal funds on an overnight basis 
and finally  at december  and december   our total loan to total asset ratios of and  respectively  were low relative to our comparative peer group of financial institutions 
the slight decrease in the company s liquidity position was principally due to a significant growth in loans during our commitments to extend credit and stand by letters of credit increased between december  and december  at december   commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit were million as compared to million at december   a million or increase between the periods 
the increase between december  and december  was principally due to increases in our commercial lines of credit  commercial letters of credit  and commitments to fund real estate construction 
our experience indicates that draws on the commitments to extend credit and stand by letters of credit do not fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and therefore are not expected to significantly impact our liquidity prospectively 
we recognize that deposit flows and loan and investment prepayment activity are affected by the level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by competitors  and other factors 
based on our deposit retention experience  anticipated levels of regional economic activity  particularly moderate levels of loan demand within our primary market area  and current pricing strategies  we anticipate that we will have sufficient levels of liquidity to meet our current funding commitments for several quarters prospectively 
f 
capital resources and dividends the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by our management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
our principal capital planning goal is to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient capital base to provide for future expansion and comply with all regulatory standards 
between december  and december  our total shareholders equity increased million or 
total shareholders equity was million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase in shareholders equity between the periods was due to an increase in retained earnings and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss  reduced  in part  by an increase in treasury stock 
during  we earned million in net income and declared and paid million in cash dividends to shareholders  resulting in a million or increase in retained earnings 
accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased from million at december  to thousand at december   due to two factors  namely a significant decrease in the net unrealized loss on securities  net of tax and a significant increase in the pension asset  net of tax 
due to a decrease in the general level of interest rates between december  and december   we recorded a million decrease in the net unrealized loss k 
index on securities  net of tax 
in addition  we recorded a million increase in the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan  net of tax 
the increase in retained earnings and the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income was reduced  in part  by a thousand increase in treasury stock resulting from our purchase of  shares of common stock at a total cost of thousand 
the company and the bank are both subject to regulatory capital guidelines 
under these guidelines  as established by federal bank regulators  in order to be adequately capitalized  the company and the bank must both maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of and a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of 
tier capital is comprised of shareholders equity  less intangible assets and accumulated other comprehensive income 
total capital for this risk based capital standard includes tier capital plus the company s allowance for loan losses 
similarly  for the bank to be considered well capitalized  it must maintain a tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio of and a total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 
the company exceeded all capital adequacy guidelines and the bank exceeded all well capitalized guidelines at december  and december  the company s tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio and total capital to risk weighted assets ratio at december  were and  respectively 
this compares to and  respectively  at december  additional details regarding the company s and the bank s capital ratios are set forth in note of the company s consolidated financial statements located in part ii  item  of this document 
the principal source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by the company has been dividends declared and paid to the company by its subsidiary bank 
there are various legal and regulatory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends to the company by its subsidiaries  as well as the payment of dividends by the company to its shareholders 
as of december   under these statutory limitations  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiary to the company without special regulatory approval was approximately million 
the ability of the company and the bank to pay dividends in the future is and will continue to be influenced by regulatory policies  capital guidelines  and applicable laws

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business activities generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market conditions  including rates and prices  will reduce earnings and make the company less valuable 
we are primarily exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates 
this risk is called interest rate risk and is an inherent component of risk for all banks 
the risk occurs because we pay interest on deposits and borrowed funds at varying rates and terms  while receiving interest income on loans and investments with different rates and terms 
as a result  our earnings and the imputed economic value of assets and liabilities are subject to potentially significant fluctuations as interest rates rise and fall 
our objective is to minimize the fluctuation in net interest margin and net interest income caused by anticipated and unanticipated changes in interest rates 
ultimately  the bank s board of directors is responsible for monitoring and managing market and interest rate risk 
the board accomplishes this objective by annually reviewing and approving an asset and liability management policy  which establishes broad risk limits and delegates responsibility to carry out asset and liability oversight and control to the directors loan and investment committee and management s alco 
we manage a few different forms of interest rate risk 
the first is mismatch risk  which involves the mismatch of maturities of fixed rate assets and liabilities 
the second is basis risk 
basis risk is the risk associated with non correlated changes in different interest rates 
for example  we price many of our adjustable rate commercial loans assets using the prime rate as a basis  while some of our deposit accounts liabilities are tied to treasury security yields 
in a given timeframe  the prime rate might decrease while a particular treasury security might only decrease 
if this were to occur  our yield on prime based commercial loans would decrease by  while the cost of deposits might only decrease by  negatively affecting net interest income and net interest margin 
the third risk is option risk 
option risk generally appears in the form of prepayment volatility on residential mortgages  commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  consumer loans  mortgage backed securities  and callable agency or municipal investment securities 
the bank s customers generally have alternative financing sources or options to refinance their existing debt obligations with other financial institutions 
when interest rates decrease  many of these customers exercise this option by refinancing at other institutions and prepay their loans with us  forcing us to reinvest the prepaid funds in lower yielding investments and k 
index loans 
the same type of refinancing activity also accelerates principal payments on mortgage backed securities held by the bank 
municipal investment securities and agency securities are issued with specified call dates and call prices that are typically exercised by the issuer when interest rates on comparable maturity securities are lower than the current coupon rate on the security 
measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that the bank s management must continually perform to meet the objective of maintaining stable net interest income and net interest margin 
this means that prior to setting the term or interest rate on loans or deposits  or before purchasing investment securities or borrowing funds  management must understand the impact that alternative interest rates will have on the bank s interest rate risk profile 
this is accomplished through simulation modeling 
simulation modeling is the process of shocking the current balance sheet under a variety of interest rate scenarios and then measuring the impact of interest rate changes on both projected earnings and the economic value of the bank s equity 
the estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based on numerous assumptions including  but not limited to the nature and timing of interest rate changes  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit retention rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment replacement rates on asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based on available information and current economic and local market conditions  management cannot make any assurances as to the ultimate accuracy of these assumptions  including competitive influences and customer behavior 
accordingly  actual results may differ from those predicted by simulation modeling 
the following table shows the projected changes in net interest income from a parallel shift in all market interest rates 
the shift in interest rates is assumed to occur in monthly increments of per month until the full shift is complete 
in other words  we assume it will take six months for a shift to take place 
this is also known as a ramped interest rate shock 
the projected changes in net interest income are totals for the twelve month period beginning january  and ending december   under ramped shock scenarios 
interest rate sensitivity table interest rates dollars in thousands interest rate shock prime rate projected annualized net interest income projected dollar change in net interest income projected percentage change in net interest income projected change in net interest income as a percent of total shareholders equity no change under a ramped interest rate shock  interest rates are modeled to change at a rate of per month 
many assumptions are embedded within our interest rate risk model 
these assumptions are approved by the bank s alco and are based upon both management s experience and projections provided by investment securities companies 
assuming our prepayment and other assumptions are accurate  and assuming we take reasonable actions to preserve net interest income  we project that net interest income would decline by thousand or of total shareholders equity in a ramped interest rate shock and by thousand or of total shareholders equity in a ramped interest rate shock 
this is within our asset and liability policy guideline  which limits the maximum projected decrease in net interest income in a or ramped interest rate shock to of the company s total equity capital 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk is impacted by overall market conditions and customer demand  but we generally try to limit the volume and term of fixed rate assets and fixed rate liabilities so that we can adjust the mix and pricing of assets and liabilities to mitigate net interest income volatility 
we also purchase investments for the securities k 
index portfolio and structure borrowings from the fhlbny to offset interest rate risk taken in the loan portfolio 
we also offer adjustable rate loan and deposit products that change as interest rates change 
approximately of our total assets at december  were invested in adjustable rate loans and investments 
at december   the treasury yield curve was generally flat 
this means the yields on long term treasury yields were only modestly greater than short term treasury yields 
at december   the one year treasury bill yield was approximately  versus for the ten year treasury note  only a basis point difference 
a flat interest rate environment inhibits our ability to earn net interest income since banks typically earn net interest income by procuring short term deposits and borrowings and investing those proceeds in longer term loans and investments 
this practice  which is sometimes referred to as mismatching assets and liabilities  typically allows banks to enhance their interest spread  which generates net interest income 
furthermore  due to a weakening national economy since december  the general level of interest rates has dropped precipitously  particularly for instruments with a maturity of two years or less 
although this interest rate environment may provide us opportunity to reduce interest expense  the basis point drop in the target federal funds rate and the national prime rate will also negatively impact interest income 
our modeling predicts that this decrease will marginally improve net interest income over a one year timeframe  although the interest rate environment generally remains difficult for banks
