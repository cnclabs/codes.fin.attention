item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
elimination of the ffel program would have a significant negative effect on the company s earnings and operations 
in connection with the presidential election  certain candidates have proposed the elimination of the ffel program 
elimination of the ffel program would significantly impact the company s operations and profitability by  among other things  reducing the company s interest revenues as a result of the inability to add new ffelp loans to the company s portfolio and reducing third party servicing fees as a result of reduced ffelp loan servicing and origination volume from the company s third party servicing customers 
the company cannot predict whether any such proposals will ultimately be enacted 
operating segments fee based businesses the following risk factors relate to the company s operating segments not directly related to the ffel program 
these operating segments include tuition payment processing and campus commerce  enrollment services and list management  and software and technical services 
if regulatory authorities prohibit student lenders from engaging in non lending activities  the company may no longer be allowed to offer certain products and services or may be required to exit the lending business  which could negatively impact the company s revenues 
as a diversified education services company  the company offers many products and services which are not related to the ffel program 
recently  various regulatory authorities have started to examine the relationships between student lending companies and their customers 
in the event state and or federal authorities adopt restrictions on the products and services which may be offered by student lending companies  the company may have to cease offering certain products and services or may be limited to marketing those products and services to customers which do not participate in the ffel program 
any restrictions on the company s ability to market or sell products or services may have a negative impact on the company s revenues 
changes in legislation and regulations could have a negative impact upon the company s business and may affect its profitability 
changes to privacy and direct mail legislation could negatively impact the company  in particular the company s list management and lead generation activities 
changes in such legislation could restrict the company s ability to collect information for its list management and lead generation activities and its ability to use the information it collects 
the company has a privacy policy that covers how certain subsidiaries collect  protect  and use personal information 
depending on the department  product  and or other factors  certain entities may have more restrictive information handling practices 

table of contents the company s software and technical services operating segment provides information technology products and services  with core areas of business in student loan software solutions for schools  lenders  and guarantors 
many of the company s customers receiving these services have been negatively impacted as a result of the passage of the college cost reduction act in september and the recent disruption in the capital markets 
this impact could decrease the demand for the company s products and services and affect the company s revenue and profit margins 
the company s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences 
demand for the company s products and services  which impact revenue and profit margins  is affected by i the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products and services  ii the company s response to pricing to stay competitive  and iii the change in customers preferences for the company s products and services  including the success of products and services offered by competitors 
in addition  k and post secondary enrollment numbers impact the demand for the company s products and services 
education enrollment numbers are impacted by general population trends and the general state of the economy 
revenue in the company s fee based businesses is recurring only to the extent that customer relationships are sustained 
reduction in volume or loss of a customer relationship could have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company faces liquidity risks associated with financing student loan originations and acquisitions 
the company s primary funding needs are those required to finance its student loan portfolio and satisfy its cash requirements for new student loan originations and acquisitions 
in general  the amount  type  and cost of the company s funding  including securitization and unsecured financing from the capital markets and borrowings from financial institutions  have a direct impact on the company s operating expenses and financial results and can limit the company s ability to grow its student loan assets 
the company relies upon secured financing vehicles as its most significant source of funding for student loans 
the company s primary secured financing vehicles are loan warehouse facilities and asset backed securitizations 
as discussed in more detail below with respect to the company s loan warehouse facilities and asset backed securitizations  the recent unprecedented disruptions in the credit markets have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the cost and availability of financing for the company s student loan portfolios  and as a result have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
such credit market conditions may continue or worsen in the future 
student loan warehousing allows the company to buy and manage student loans prior to transferring them into more permanent financing arrangements 
a portion of the company s operating and warehouse financings are provided by third parties  over which it has no control 
current conditions in the debt markets have resulted in reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums for most market participants 
these conditions can increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt in the capital markets 
if warehouse financing sources are unavailable  the company may be unable to meet its financial commitments to schools  branding partners  or forward flow lenders when due unless the company is able to find alternative funding mechanisms 
the company attempts to mitigate the impact of debt market disruptions by obtaining adequate committed and uncommitted facilities from a variety of reliable sources 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in these efforts  that such facilities will be adequate  or that the cost of debt will allow the company to operate at profitable levels 
the company currently relies on two conduit warehouse loan financing vehicles to support its funding needs on a short term basis a multi seller bank provided conduit with billion of committed funding for ffelp student loans and a private loan warehouse with million in authorized financing for non federally insured student loans 
the company s private loan warehouse terminates in january the facility for ffelp loans  which terminates in may  is supported by day liquidity which is up for renewal in may in order to continue funding new originations  the company s liquidity must be renewed 
if not renewed  the company s ability to fund new originations in the facility will be at risk 
if the company is able to renew its liquidity on this line  it will come at an increased cost compared to historical periods 
if the company is not able to renew the liquidity on this facility or renew the facility at a price acceptable to the company  it may become a term facility with a maturity date of may the company s cost of financing on the term facility would be slightly higher than its current cost of funds as a warehouse facility 
if the company s warehouse facility becomes a term facility  the company will no longer be able to fund new ffelp student loan originations or acquisitions 
the terms and conditions of the company s warehouse facility for ffelp loans provide for advance rates related to financed loans subject to a valuation formula based on current market conditions 
dislocation in the credit markets including disruptions in the current capital markets can and will cause short term volatility in the loan valuation formulas and could reduce advance rates requiring a portion of the financed loans to be funded using equity or alternative sources 
severe volatility and dislocation in the credit markets  although temporary  could cause the valuation assigned to its student loan portfolio financed by the applicable line to be less than par 
should a significant change in the valuation of subject loans require an equity contribution or reduction in advance rates greater than what the company can or is willing to inject  the warehouse line could be subject to termination 
while the company does not believe the loan valuation formula is reflective of the fair market value of its loans  it is subject to compliance with provisions of the warehouse documents 
the company s private loan warehouse facility has similar credit enhancement provisions 
the company uses its warehouse facilities to pool student loans in order to maximize loan portfolio characteristics for efficient financing and to properly time market conditions for movement of the loans into an asset backed securitization 
the company has historically relied upon  and expects to continue to rely upon  asset backed securitizations as its most significant source of funding for student loans on a long term basis 
if this market continues to experience difficulties or worsen  the company may be unable to securitize its student loans or to do so on favorable terms  including pricing  or may do so at an increased price as compared to its current or future warehouse cost 

table of contents a number of factors could make such securitization more difficult  more expensive  or unavailable on any terms  including  but not limited to  financial results and losses  changes within the company s organization  specific events that have an adverse impact on the company s reputation  changes in the activities of the company s business partners  disruptions in the capital markets  specific events that have an adverse impact on the financial services industry  counter party availability  changes affecting the company s assets  the company s corporate and regulatory structure  interest rate fluctuations  ratings agencies actions  general economic conditions  and the legal  regulatory  accounting  and tax environments governing the company s funding transactions 
in addition  the company s ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the united states and world economies  and may become increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors 
if the company were unable to continue to securitize student loans on favorable terms  it could use alternative funding sources to meet liquidity needs 
if the company is unable to find cost effective and stable funding alternatives  its funding capabilities and liquidity would be negatively impacted and its cost of funds could increase  adversely affecting the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company s ability to originate and acquire student loans would be limited or could be eliminated 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk because the interest rate characteristics of the company s assets do not match the interest rate characteristics of the funding 
the company s primary market risk exposure arises from fluctuations in its borrowing and lending rates  the spread between which could be impacted by shifts in market interest rates 
the borrower rates on the company s current portfolio of federally insured loans are generally reset by the department each july st based on a formula determined by the date of the origination of the loan  with the exception of rates on consolidation loans  which are generally fixed rate to the borrower for the life of the loan 
for all ffelp loans originated after july   the loans are fixed rate to the borrower for the life of the loan 
for ffelp loans originated prior to april   the interest rate the company actually receives on federally insured loans is the greater of the borrower rate and a sap rate determined by a formula based on a spread to either the day treasury bill index or the day commercial paper index  depending on when the loans were originated and the current repayment status of the loans 
on ffelp loans originated on or after april   the company only earns interest at the sap rate determined by a formula based on day commercial paper 
for the ffelp portfolio of loans originated on or after april   when the borrower rate exceeds the variable rate based upon the sap formula  the company must return the excess to the department 
the company issues asset backed securities  the vast majority being variable rate  to fund its student loan assets 
the variable rate debt is generally indexed to month libor  set by auction  or through a remarketing process 
the income generated by the company s student loan assets is generally driven by short term indices treasury bills and commercial paper that are different from those which affect the company s liabilities generally libor  which creates basis risk 
moreover  the company also faces repricing risk due to the timing of the interest rate resets on its liabilities  which may occur as infrequently as every quarter  and the timing of the interest rate resets on its assets  which generally occur daily 
in a declining interest rate environment  this may cause the company s student loan spread to compress  while in a rising rate environment  it may cause it to increase 
in using different index types and different index reset frequencies to fund assets  the company is exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk  which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies  or will not move in the same direction or with the same magnitude 
while these indices are short term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a longer period of time  there can be no assurance that this high correlation will not be disrupted by capital market dislocations or other factors not within the company s control 
in such circumstances  the company s earnings could be adversely affected  possibly to a material extent 
the company uses derivative instruments to hedge the basis risk due to the timing of the interest rate resets on its assets and liabilities 
however  the company does not generally hedge the basis risk due to the different interest rate indices associated with its assets and liabilities since the relationship between the indices for most of the company s assets and liabilities is highly correlated 
nevertheless  the basis between the indices may widen from time to time  which would impact the net spread on the portfolio 
characteristics unique to asset backed securitizations may negatively affect the company s continued liquidity 
the interest rates on certain of the company s asset backed securities are set and periodically reset via a dutch auction auction rate securities or through a remarketing utilizing broker dealers and remarketing agents variable rate demand notes 
for auction rate securities  investors and potential investors submit orders through a broker dealer as to the principal amount of notes they wish to buy  hold  or sell at various interest rates 
the broker dealers submit their clients orders to the auction agent  who then determines the clearing interest rate for the upcoming period 
interest rates on these auction rate securities are reset periodically  generally every to days  by the auction agent or agents 
recently  as part of the ongoing credit market crisis  several auction rate securities from various issuers have failed to receive sufficient order interest from potential investors to clear successfully  resulting in failed auction status 
since february   the company s auction rate securities have failed in this manner 
under normal conditions  the banks would step in when investor demand is weak 
however  as of recently  they have been allowing these auctions to fail 

table of contents as a result of a failed auction  the auction rate securities will generally pay interest to the holder at a maximum rate as defined by the governing documents or indenture 
while these rates will vary slightly by class of security  they will generally be based on a spread to libor or treasury securities and will approximate the current one month libor rate plus to basis points 
these maximum rates are subject to increase if the credit ratings on the bonds are downgraded 
the company cannot predict whether future auctions related to its auction rate securities will be successful 
the company is currently seeking alternatives for reducing its exposure to the auction rate market  but may not be able to achieve alternate financing for some or all of its auction rate securities 
for variable rate demand notes  the remarketing agents set the price  which is then offered to investors 
if there are insufficient potential bid orders to purchase all of the notes offered for sale  the company could be subject to interest costs substantially above the anticipated and historical rates paid on these types of securities 
certain of the variable rate demand notes are secured by financial guaranty insurance policies issued by municipal bond investors assurance mbia 
the variable rate demand notes insured by mbia are currently experiencing reduced investor demand and certain of these securities have been put to the liquidity provider  lloyds tsb bank  at a cost ranging from federal funds plus basis points to libor plus basis points 
if there is no demand for the company s auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes  the company could be subject to interest costs substantially above the anticipated and historical rates paid on these types of securities 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk because of the interest rate characteristics of certain of its assets and the interest rate characteristics of the related funding of such assets 
ffelp student loans generally earn interest at the higher of a floating rate based on the special allowance payment or sap formula set by the department and the borrower rate  which is fixed over a period of time 
the company generally finances its student loan portfolio with variable rate debt 
in low and or declining interest rate environments  when the fixed borrower rate is higher than the rate produced by the sap formula  the company s student loans earn at a fixed rate while the interest on the variable rate debt continues to decline 
in these interest rate environments  the company earns additional spread income that it refers to as fixed rate floor income 
depending on the type of the student loan and when it was originated  the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to market rate each july as a result  for loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term  the company earns floor income for an extended period of time  which the company refers to as fixed rate floor income  and for those loans where the borrower rate is reset annually on july  the company earns floor income to the next reset date  which the company refers to as variable rate floor income 
in accordance with new legislation enacted in  lenders are required to rebate floor income and variable rate floor income to the department for all new ffelp loans originated on or after april  absent the use of derivative instruments  a rise in interest rates may reduce the amount of floor income received and this may have an impact on earnings due to interest margin compression caused by increasing financing costs  until such time as the federally insured loans earn interest at a variable rate in accordance with the special allowance payment formula 
in higher interest rate environments  where the interest rate rises above the borrower rate and fixed rate loans effectively become variable rate loans  the impact of the rate fluctuations is reduced 
the company is subject to foreign currency exchange risk and such risk could lead to increased costs 
as a result of the company s offerings in euro denominated notes  the company is exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us and euro dollars 
the principal and accrued interest on these notes is re measured at each reporting period and recorded on the company s balance sheet in us dollars based on the foreign currency exchange rate on that date 
when foreign currency exchange rates between the us and euro dollars change significantly  earnings may fluctuate significantly 
the company entered into cross currency interest rate swaps in connection with the issuance of these notes 
the company s derivative instruments may not be successful in managing interest and foreign currency exchange rate risks  which may negatively impact the company s operations 
when the company utilizes derivative instruments  it utilizes them to manage interest and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity 
although the company does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes  its derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 consequently  the change in fair value  called the mark to market  of these derivative instruments is included in the company s operating results 
changes or shifts in the forward yield curve and foreign currency exchange rates can and have significantly impacted the valuation of the company s derivatives 
accordingly  changes or shifts in the forward yield curve and foreign currency exchange rates will impact the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of the company 
further  the company may have to repay certain costs including transaction fees or be subject to wide bid ask spreads if the company terminates a derivative instrument 
the derivative instruments used by the company are typically in the form of interest rate swaps  basis swaps  interest rate floor contracts  and cross currency interest rate swaps 

table of contents developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates is complex  and no strategy can completely insulate the company from risks associated with such fluctuations 
although the company believes its derivative instruments are highly effective  because many of its derivatives are not balance guaranteed to a particular pool of student loans  the company is subject to prepayment risk that could result in the company being under or over hedged that may result in material losses to the company 
in addition  a counterparty to a derivative instrument could default on its obligation  thereby exposing the company to counterparty risk 
further  the company may have to repay certain costs  such as transaction fees or brokerage costs  if the company terminates a derivative instrument 
finally  the company s interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management activities could expose the company to substantial mark to market losses if interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates move materially differently from the environment when the derivatives were entered into 
as a result  the company cannot offer any assurance that its economic hedging activities will effectively manage its interest and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity nor have the desired beneficial impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
when the mark to market of a derivative instrument is negative  the company owes the counterparty and  therefore  has no counterparty risk 
additionally  if the negative mark to market of derivatives with a counterparty exceeds a specified threshold  the company may have to pay a collateral deposit to the counterparty 
if interest and foreign currency exchange rates move materially  the company could be required to deposit a significant amount of collateral with its derivative instrument counterparties 
the collateral deposits  if significant  could negatively impact the company s capital resources 
the company attempts to manage market risks associated with interest and foreign currency exchange rates by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken 
the ratings of the company or of any securities sold by the company may change  which may increase the company s costs of capital and may reduce the liquidity of the company s securities 
ratings are based primarily on the creditworthiness of the company  the underlying assets of asset backed securitizations  the amount of credit enhancement in any given transaction and the legal structure of any given transaction 
ratings are not a recommendation to purchase  hold  or sell any of the company s securities inasmuch as the ratings do not comment as to the market price or suitability for investors 
there is no assurance that ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that current ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn by any rating agency 
ratings for the company or any of its securities may be increased  lowered  or withdrawn by any rating agency if in the rating agency s judgment circumstances so warrant 
if the company s credit ratings are lowered or withdrawn  the company may experience an increase in interest rates or other costs associated with the capital raising activities by the company  which may negatively affect the company s operations 
additionally  a lowered or withdrawn credit rating may negatively affect the liquidity of the company s securities 
the company may be limited in its ability to pay dividends or make other payments as a result of the terms of certain outstanding securities issued by the company 
in september  the company issued certain junior subordinated hybrid securities the hybrid securities 
so long as the hybrid securities remain outstanding  if the company has given notice of its election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing  then the company will not  and will not permit any of its subsidiaries to declare or pay any dividends or distributions on  or redeem  purchase  acquire or make a liquidation payment regarding  any of the company s capital stock  except as required in connection with the repayment of principal  and except for any partial payments of deferred interest that may be made through the alternative payment mechanism described in the indenture relating to the hybrid securities  make any payment of principal of  or interest or premium  if any  on  or repay  repurchase or redeem any of the company s debt securities that rank pari passu with or junior to the hybrid securities  or make any guaranty payments regarding any guaranty by the company of the subordinated debt securities of any of the company s subsidiaries if the guaranty ranks pari passu with or junior in interest to the hybrid securities 
in addition  if any deferral period lasts longer than one year  the limitation on the company s ability to redeem or repurchase any of its securities that rank pari passu with or junior in interest to the hybrid securities will continue until the first anniversary of the date on which all deferred interest has been paid or cancelled 

table of contents if the company is involved in a business combination where immediately after its consummation more than of the surviving entity s voting stock is owned by the shareholders of the other party to the business combination  then the immediately preceding sentence will not apply to any deferral period that is terminated on the next interest payment date following the date of consummation of the business combination 
however  at any time  including during a deferral period  the company will be permitted to pay dividends or distributions in additional shares of the company s capital stock  declare or pay a dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholders rights plan  or issue stock under such a plan  or redeem or repurchase any rights distributed pursuant to such a plan  and purchase common stock for issuance pursuant to any employee benefit plans 
if the company s stock price falls  the company s contingent obligations under certain agreements related to business acquisitions increase 
in november  the company purchased the remaining of the stock of solutions  inc 
consideration for the purchase was  restricted shares of the company s class a common stock 
the  shares of class a common stock issued in the acquisition are subject to put option agreements whereby during the day period ending november  the holders may require the company to repurchase all or part of the shares at a price of per share 
the value of the put options as of the closing date of the acquisition was million and was recorded by the company as additional purchase price 
the change in the value of the put option each reporting period is included in the company s operating results 
as of december   the value of the put options was million 
the fair value of these options is primarily affected by the strike price and term of the underlying option  the company s current stock price  and the dividend yield and volatility of the company s stock 
accordingly  changes or shifts in these inputs will impact the financial position and results of operations of the company 
in february  the company purchased the remaining of the stock of infinet integrated solutions  inc infinet 
consideration for the purchase of the remaining of the stock of infinet was million in cash and  restricted shares of the company s class a common stock 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  the  shares of class a common stock issued in the acquisition are subject to stock price guaranty provisions whereby if on or about february  the average market trading price of the class a common stock is less than per share and has not exceeded that price for any consecutive trading days during the year period from the closing of the acquisition to february   then the company must pay additional cash to the sellers of infinet for each share of class a common stock issued in an amount representing the difference between less the greater of or the gross sales price such seller obtained from a sale of the shares occurring subsequent to february  as defined in the agreement 
any payment on the guaranty is reduced by the aggregate of any dividends or other distributions made by the company to the sellers 
any cash paid by the company in consideration of satisfying the guaranteed value of stock issued for this acquisition would be recorded by the company as a reduction to additional paid in capital 
general risk factors incorrect estimates and assumptions by management in connection with the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements could adversely affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
the company s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings 
the outcome of legal proceedings may differ from the company s expectations because the outcomes of litigation  including regulatory matters  are often difficult to reliably predict 
various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable  or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates  such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment  a significant settlement  significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law 
a future adverse ruling  settlement  or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period 

table of contents the company s failure to successfully manage business and certain asset acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and or results of operations 
the company may acquire new products and services or enhance existing products and services through acquisitions of other companies  product lines  technologies  and personnel  or through investments in other companies 
during through  the company acquired the stock and certain assets of different entities 
any acquisition or investment is subject to a number of risks 
such risks may include diversion of management time and resources  disruption of the company s ongoing business  difficulties in integrating acquisitions  dilution to existing stockholders if the company s common stock is issued in consideration for an acquisition or investment  incurring or assuming indebtedness or other liabilities in connection with an acquisition  lack of familiarity with new markets  and difficulties in supporting new product lines 
the company s failure to successfully manage acquisitions or investments  or successfully integrate acquisitions  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and or results of operations 
correspondingly  the company s expectations to the accretive nature of the acquisitions could be inaccurate 
the market price of the company s class a common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may result in losses for investors 
from january  to february   the closing daily sales price of the company s class a common stock as reported by the new york stock exchange ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
the company expects the class a common stock to continue to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors  including factors beyond the company s control 
these factors include changes in interest rates and credit market conditions affecting the cost and availability of financing for the company s student loan assets  changes in the education financing regulatory framework  changes in demand for education financing or other products and services that the company offers  variations in the company s quarterly operating results  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of comparable companies  and future sales of the company s class a common stock 
the company may not meet the expectations of shareholders and or of securities analysts at some time in the future  and the market price of the company s class a common stock could decline as a result 
the company may not always pay dividends on its common stock 
the payment of future dividends on the company s shares of class a common stock and class b common stock remains in the discretion of the company s board of directors and will continue to depend on the company s earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  and other factors 
in addition  the payment of dividends is subject to the terms of certain other outstanding securities issued by the company as discussed above 
the board of directors may determine in the future to reduce the current quarterly dividend rate of per share or discontinue the payment of dividends altogether 
negative publicity that may be associated with the student lending industry  including negative publicity about the company  may harm the company s reputation and adversely affect operating results 
recently  the student lending industry has been the subject of various investigations and reports 
the publicity associated with these investigations and reports may have a negative impact on the company s reputation 
to the extent that potential or existing customers decide not to utilize the company s products or services as a result of such publicity  the company s operating results may be adversely affected 
if management does not effectively execute the company s restructuring plans  this could adversely affect the company s operations  revenue  and the ability to compete 
on september   the company announced a strategic restructuring initiative to create efficiencies and lower costs in advance of the enactment of the college cost reduction act  which impacted the ffel program in which the company participates 
the company has significant financing needs that it meets through the capital markets  including the debt and secondary markets 
since august  these markets have experienced unprecedented disruptions  which are having an adverse impact on the company s earnings and financial condition 
on january   the company announced a plan to further reduce operating expenses related to its student loan origination and related businesses as a result of the ongoing disruption in the credit markets 

table of contents the company continues to implement its restructuring initiatives  including lowering the cost of student loan acquisition  creating efficiencies in its asset generation business  and decreasing operating expenses through a reduction in workforce and realignment of operating facilities 
the company expects these initiatives to be substantially completed during if the company is unable to successfully implement its reorganization initiatives or if those initiatives do not have the desired effects or result in the projected efficiencies  the company may incur additional or unexpected expenses which would adversely affect the company s operations and revenues 
failures in the company s information technology system could materially disrupt its business 
the company s servicing and operating processes are highly dependent upon its information technology system infrastructure  and the company faces the risk of business disruption if failures in its information systems occur  which could have a material impact upon its business and operations 
the company depends heavily on its own computer based data processing systems in servicing both its own student loans and those of third party servicing customers and providing tuition payment and campus commerce transactions and lead generation products and services 
the company regularly backs up its data and maintains detailed disaster recovery plans 
a major physical disaster or other calamity that causes significant damage to information systems could adversely affect the company s business 
additionally  loss of information systems for a sustained period of time could have a negative impact on the company s performance and ultimately on cash flow in the event the company were unable to process transactions and or provide services to customers 
a loss of customer data requiring notification to customers could negatively impact the company s business 
the company  on its own behalf and on behalf of other entities  stores a significant amount of personal data about the customers to whom the company provides services 
if the company were to suffer a major loss of customer data  through breach of its systems or otherwise  entities for which the company provides services might choose to find another service provider 
certain participants in the company s stock compensation and benefit plans may have rescission rights with respect to shares of stock acquired under those plans 
in april  the company discovered that as a result of inadvertent issues related to the delivery of documents to participants  certain participants in the company s employee share purchase plan  restricted stock plan  directors stock compensation plan  and employee stock purchase loan plan may not have during certain time frames actually received all of the information required to constitute a fully compliant prospectus under the securities act of while the issuance of shares under those plans has been registered with the securities and exchange commission under registration statements on form s  it is a violation of section of the securities act of to sell a security for which a registration statement has been filed unless accompanied or preceded by a prospectus that meets the requirements of section of the securities act of section of the securities act of generally provides for a one year rescission right for an investor who acquires a security from a seller who does not comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of section of the securities act of as such  an investor successfully asserting a rescission right during the one year time period has the right to require an issuer to repurchase the securities acquired by the investor at the price paid by the investor for the securities or if such security has been disposed of  to receive damages with respect to any loss on such disposition  plus interest from the date of acquisition 
these rights may apply to affected participants in the company s plans 
the company believes that its potential liability for rescission claims or other damages is not material to the company s financial condition  however  the company s potential liability could become material to results of operations for a particular period if  during the one year period following non compliant sales  the market price of the shares of class a common stock falls significantly below the affected participants acquisition prices 
exposure related to certain tax issues could decrease the company s net income 
a corporation is considered to be a personal holding company under the us internal revenue code of  as amended the code  if at least of its adjusted ordinary gross income is personal holding company income generally  passive income and at any time during the last half of the taxable year more than half  by value  of its stock is owned by five or fewer individuals  as determined under attribution rules of the code 
if both of these tests are met  a personal holding company is subject to an additional tax on its undistributed personal holding company income  currently at a rate 
five or fewer individuals hold more than half the value of the company s stock 
in june  the company submitted a request for a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service seeking a determination that its federally guaranteed student loans qualify as assets of a lending or finance business  as defined in the code 
such a determination would have assured the company that holding such loans does not make it a personal holding company 
based on its historical practice of not issuing private letter rulings concerning matters that it considers to be primarily factual  however  the internal revenue service has indicated that it will not issue the requested ruling  taking no position on the merits of the legal issue 

table of contents so long as more than half of the company s value continues to be held by five or fewer individuals  if it were to be determined that some portion of its federally guaranteed student loans does not qualify as assets of a lending or finance business  as defined in the code  the company could become subject to personal holding company tax on its undistributed personal holding company income 
the company continues to believe that neither nelnet  inc nor any of its subsidiaries is a personal holding company 
however  even if nelnet  inc or one of its subsidiaries was determined to be a personal holding company  the company believes that by utilizing intercompany distributions  it could eliminate or substantially eliminate its exposure to personal holding company taxes  although it cannot assure that this will be the case 
the company is subject to federal and state income tax laws and regulations 
income tax regulations are often complex and require interpretation 
changes in income tax regulations could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
if states enact legislation  alter apportionment methodologies  or aggressively apply the income tax nexus standards  the company may become subject to additional state taxes 
the applicability and taxation on the earnings from intangible personal property has been the subject of state audits and litigation with state taxing authorities and tax policy debates by various state legislatures 
as the congress and us supreme court have not provided clear guidance in this regard  conflicting state laws and court decisions create tremendous uncertainty and expense for taxpayers conducting interstate commerce 
during  the company began to be examined by multiple state taxing authorities 
these taxing authorities routinely challenge certain filing methodologies  apportionment  and certain deductions reported by the company on its income tax returns 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and fas interpretation no 
 account for uncertainty in income taxes  the company establishes reserves for tax contingencies related to deductions and credits that it may be unable to sustain 
differences between the reserves for tax contingencies and the amounts ultimately owed are recorded in the period they become known

the company responded to the irs in november requesting relief from retroactivity and has recently received a request for additional information from the irs 
the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the irs letter and has not determined its legal remedies if its request regarding retroactive application is denied 
an adverse outcome could be material to the financial statements and could cause the company to take action with respect to surplus fund withdrawals since september  if the private letter ruling is applied retroactively

the company recognized a net loss of million related to the transaction 
as a result of this transaction  the results of operations for edulinx are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
legislative impact on september   the president signed into law the college cost reduction act 
this legislation contains provisions with significant implications for participants in the ffel program  including cutting funding to the ffel program by billion over a five year period as estimated by the congressional budget office 
among other things  this legislation reduced special allowance payments to for profit lenders and not for profit lenders by percentage points and percentage points  respectively  for both stafford and consolidation loans disbursed on or after october   reduced special allowance payments to for profit lenders and not for profit lenders by percentage points and percentage points  respectively  for plus loans disbursed on or after october  
table of contents increased origination fees paid by lenders on all ffelp loan types  from percent to percent  for all loans first disbursed on or after october   eliminated all provisions relating to exceptional performer status  and the monetary benefit associated with it  effective october   and for loans first disbursed on or after october   reduces default insurance to percent of the unpaid principal of such loans 
as a result of this legislation  management expects the annual yield on ffelp loans to decrease by to basis points on student loans originated after october  upon passage of the college cost reduction act  management evaluated the carrying amount of goodwill and certain intangible assets 
based on the legislative changes and the student loan business model modifications the company implemented as a result of the legislative changes  the company recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter of the company also recorded an expense of million during the third quarter of to increase the company s allowance for loan losses related to the increase in risk share as a result of the elimination of the exceptional performer program 
in october  the company entered into an agreement to amend an existing contract with college assist 
college assist is the colorado state designated guarantor of ffelp student loans 
under the agreement  the company provides student loan servicing and guaranty operations and assumed the operational expenses and employment of certain college assist employees 
college assist pays the company a portion of the gross servicing and guaranty fees as consideration for the company providing these services on behalf of college assist 
as a result of the passage of the college cost reduction act  on october   the department notified college assist of its decision to formally terminate the voluntary flexible agreement vfa between the department and college assist effective january  the termination of the vfa will decrease the company s guaranty income by approximately million annually 
restructuring charges legislative impact on september   the company announced a strategic initiative to create efficiencies and lower costs in advance of the passage of the college cost reduction act 
in anticipation of the federally driven cuts to the student loan programs  management initiated a variety of strategies to modify the company s student loan business model  including lowering the cost of student loan acquisition  creating efficiencies in the company s asset generation business  and decreasing operating expenses through a reduction in workforce and realignment of operating facilities 
these strategies resulted in the net reduction of approximately positions in the company s overall workforce  including the elimination of approximately positions and the creation of approximately positions at the company s larger facilities 
in addition  the company simplified its operating structure to leverage its larger facilities and technology by closing five small origination offices and downsizing its presence in indianapolis 
implementation of the plan began immediately and was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of the company estimates these restructuring activities will result in expense savings of as much as million annually beginning in during the year ended december   the company recorded restructuring charges of million 
capital markets impact the company has significant financing needs that it meets through the capital markets  including the debt and secondary markets 
since august  these markets have experienced unprecedented disruptions  which are having an adverse impact on the company s earnings and financial condition 
on january   the company announced a plan to further reduce operating expenses related to its student loan origination and related businesses by reducing marketing  sales  service  and related support costs through a reduction in workforce of approximately positions and realignment of certain operating facilities as a result of the ongoing disruption in the credit markets 
since the company cannot determine nor control the length of time or extent to which the capital markets remain disrupted  the company will reduce its direct and indirect costs related to its asset generation activities and be more selective in pursuing origination activity  in both the school and direct to consumer channels  for both private loans and ffelp loans 
accordingly  the company has suspended consolidation student loan originations and will continue to review the viability of continuing to originate and acquire student loans through its various channels 
as a result of these items  the company will experience a decrease in origination volume compared to historical periods 

table of contents the company estimates that the total after tax charge to earnings in associated with the restructuring plan will be approximately million  consisting of approximately million in severance costs  up to million in contract termination costs  and approximately million in non cash charges related to the impairment of property and equipment  intangible assets  and goodwill 
the company anticipates that the after tax charges to earnings will be incurred during the first two quarters of  of which greater than will be incurred in the first quarter 
as a result of this additional restructuring plan  the company expects to reduce operating expenses by million to million before tax annually 
disruptions in the debt and secondary markets the company s primary market risk exposure arises from fluctuations in its borrowing and lending rates  the spread between which could be impacted by shifts in market interest rates 
the company has significant financing needs that it meets through the capital markets  including the debt and secondary markets 
since august  these markets have experienced unprecedented disruptions  which have had an adverse impact on the company s earnings and financial condition 
current conditions in the debt markets include reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums for most market participants 
these conditions increased the company s cost of debt during and reduced the company s core student loan spread 
if these markets continue to experience difficulties  the company may be unable to securitize its student loans or to do so on favorable terms  including pricing 
if the company were unable to continue to securitize student loans on favorable terms  it could use alternative funding sources to fund increases in student loans to meet liquidity needs 
if the company was unable to find cost effective and stable funding alternatives  its funding capabilities and liquidity would be negatively impacted and its cost of funds could increase  adversely affecting the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company s ability to originate and acquire student loans would be limited or could be eliminated 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company reported net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change in net income was driven primarily by the restructuring and legislative related charges  the change in the derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments  and reductions in interest income as a result of no longer receiving special allowance payments in accordance with the company s settlement agreement with the department in january results of operations the company s operating results are primarily driven by the performance of its existing portfolio  the cost necessary to generate new assets  the revenues generated by its fee based businesses  and the cost to provide those services 
the performance of the company s portfolio is driven by net interest income and losses related to credit quality of the assets along with the cost to administer and service the assets and related debt 
acquisitions management believes the company s business and asset acquisitions in recent years have enhanced the company s position as a vertically integrated industry leader and established a strong foundation for growth 
although the company s assets  loan portfolios  and fee based revenues increased through such transactions  a key aspect of each transaction is its impact on the company s prospective organic growth and the development of its integrated platform of services 
management believes these acquisitions allow the company to expand the products and services offered to educational and financial institutions and students and families throughout the education and education finance process 
in addition  these acquisitions diversify the company s asset generation streams and or diversify revenue by offering other products and services that are not dependent on government programs  which management believes will reduce the company s exposure to legislative and political risk 
the company also expects to reduce costs from these acquisitions through economies of scale and by integrating certain support services 
in addition  the company expects to increase revenue from these acquisitions by offering multiple products and services to its customers 
as a result of these recent acquisitions  the period to period comparability of the company s results of operations may be difficult 
net interest income the company generates a significant portion of its earnings from the spread  referred to as its student loan spread  between the yield the company receives on its student loan portfolio and the cost of funding these loans 
this spread income is reported on the company s consolidated statements of income as net interest income 
the amortization of loan premiums  including capitalized costs of origination  the consolidation loan rebate fee  and yield adjustments from borrower benefit programs  are netted against loan interest income on the company s statements of operations 
the amortization of debt issuance costs is included in interest expense on the company s statements of operations 

table of contents the company s portfolio of ffelp loans originated prior to april  earns interest at the higher of a variable rate based on the special allowance payment sap formula set by the us department of education the department and the borrower rate 
the sap formula is based on an applicable index plus a fixed spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
as a result of one of the provisions of the higher education reconciliation act of hera  the company s portfolio of ffelp loans originated on or after april  earns interest at a variable rate based on the sap formula 
for the portfolio of loans originated on or after april   when the borrower rate exceeds the variable rate based on the sap formula  the company must return the excess to the department 
on most consolidation loans  the company must pay a per year rebate fee to the department 
those consolidation loans that have variable interest rates based on the sap formula earn an annual yield less than that of a stafford loan 
those consolidation loans that have fixed interest rates less than the sum of and the variable rate based on the sap formula also earn an annual yield less than that of a stafford loan 
as a result  as consolidation loans matching these criteria become a larger portion of the company s loan portfolio  there will be a lower yield on the company s loan portfolio in the short term 
current legislation will have a significant impact on the company s net interest income in future periods and should be considered when reviewing the company s results of operations 
on september   the president signed into law the college cost reduction act 
among other things  this legislation reduced special allowance payments to for profit lenders and not for profit lenders by percentage points and percentage points  respectively  for both stafford and consolidation loans disbursed on or after october   reduced special allowance payments to for profit lenders and not for profit lenders by percentage points and percentage points  respectively  for plus loans disbursed on or after october  increased origination fees paid by lenders on all ffelp loan types  from percent to percent  for all loans first disbursed on or after october   eliminated all provisions relating to exceptional performer status  and the monetary benefit associated with it  effective october   and reduces default insurance to percent of the unpaid principal of such loans  for loans first disbursed on or after october  management estimates the impact of this legislation will reduce the annual yield on ffelp loans originated after october  by to basis points 
the company believes it can mitigate some of the reduction in annual yield by creating efficiencies and lowering costs  modifying borrower benefits  and reducing loan acquisition costs 
because the company generates a significant portion of its earnings from its student loan spread  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s balance sheet is very important to its operations 
the current and future interest rate environment can and will affect the company s interest earnings  net interest income  and net income 
the effects of changing interest rate environments are further outlined in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
investment interest income  which is a component of net interest income  includes income from unrestricted interest earning deposits and funds in the company s special purpose entities which are utilized for its asset backed securitizations 
net interest income also includes interest expense on unsecured debt offerings 
the proceeds from these unsecured debt offerings were used by the company to fund general business operations  certain asset and business acquisitions  and the repurchase of stock under the company s stock repurchase plan 
provision for loan losses management estimates and establishes an allowance for loan losses through a provision charged to expense 
losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectibility of the loan principal is unlikely 
recovery of amounts previously charged off is credited to the allowance for loan losses 
management maintains the allowance for federally insured and non federally insured loans at a level believed to be adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
the company analyzes the allowance separately for its federally insured loans and its non federally insured loans 
management bases the allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio on periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios  considering past experience  trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  changes to federal student loan programs  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
one of the changes to the higher education act as a result of hera s enactment in february  was to lower the guaranty rates on ffelp loans  including a decrease in insurance and reinsurance on portfolios receiving the benefit of the exceptional performance designation by  from to of principal and accrued interest effective july   and a decrease in insurance and reinsurance on portfolios not subject to the exceptional performance designation by  from to of principal and accrued interest effective for all loans first disbursed on and after july

table of contents operating segments the company has five operating segments as defined in sfas no 
as follows asset generation and management  student loan and guaranty servicing  tuition payment processing and campus commerce  enrollment services and list management  and software and technical services 
the company s operating segments are defined by the products and services they offer or the types of customers they serve  and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management 
the accounting policies of the company s operating segments are the same as those described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
intersegment revenues are charged by a segment to another segment that provides the product or service 
intersegment revenues and expenses are included within each segment consistent with the income statement presentation provided to management 
changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial information 
the management reporting process measures the performance of the company s operating segments based on the management structure of the company as well as the methodology used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources 
management  including the company s chief operating decision maker  evaluates the performance of the company s operating segments based on their profitability 
as discussed further below  management measures the profitability of the company s operating segments on the basis of base net income 
accordingly  information regarding the company s operating segments is provided based on base net income 
the company s base net income is not a defined term within gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management reporting 
in may  the company sold edulinx  a canadian student loan service provider and subsidiary of the company 
as a result of this transaction  the results of operations for edulinx are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the operating results of edulinx were included in the student loan and guaranty servicing operating segment 
the company presents base net income excluding discontinued operations since the operations and cash flows of edulinx have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company 
therefore  the results of operations for the student loan and guaranty servicing segment exclude the operating results of edulinx for all periods presented 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information concerning edulinx s detailed operating results that have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations 
base net income is the primary financial performance measure used by management to develop the company s financial plans  track results  and establish corporate performance targets and incentive compensation 
while base net income is not a substitute for reported results under gaap  the company relies on base net income in operating its business because base net income permits management to make meaningful period to period comparisons of the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management 
management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the core business activities of the company s operating segments 
accordingly  the tables presented below reflect base net income which is reviewed and utilized by management to manage the business for each of the company s operating segments 
reconciliation of the segment totals to the company s consolidated operating results in accordance with gaap are also included in the tables below 
included below under non gaap performance measures is further discussion regarding base net income and its limitations  including a table that details the differences between base net income and gaap net income by operating segment

non gaap performance measures in accordance with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec  the company prepares financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition to evaluating the company s gaap based financial information  management also evaluates the company s operating segments on a non gaap performance measure referred to as base net income for each operating segment 
while base net income is not a substitute for reported results under gaap  the company relies on base net income to manage each operating segment because management believes these measures provide additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management 
base net income is the primary financial performance measure used by management to develop financial plans  allocate resources  track results  evaluate performance  establish corporate performance targets  and determine incentive compensation 
accordingly  financial information is reported to management on a base net income basis by operating segment  as these are the measures used regularly by the company s chief operating decision maker 
the company s board of directors utilizes base net income to set performance targets and evaluate management s performance 
the company also believes analysts  rating agencies  and creditors use base net income in their evaluation of the company s results of operations 
while base net income is not a substitute for reported results under gaap  the company utilizes base net income in operating its business because base net income permits management to make meaningful period to period comparisons by eliminating the temporary volatility in the company s performance that arises from certain items that are primarily affected by factors beyond the control of management 
management believes base net income provides additional insight into the financial performance of the core business activities of the company s operations 

table of contents limitations of base net income while gaap provides a uniform  comprehensive basis of accounting  for the reasons discussed above  management believes that base net income is an important additional tool for providing a more complete understanding of the company s results of operations 
nevertheless  base net income is subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider 
for example  as stated above  unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management reporting 
the company s base net income is not a defined term within gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
investors  therefore  may not be able to compare the company s performance with that of other companies based upon base net income 
base net income results are only meant to supplement gaap results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely monitored and used by the company s management and board of directors to assess performance and information which the company believes is important to analysts  rating agencies  and creditors 
other limitations of base net income arise from the specific adjustments that management makes to gaap results to derive base net income results 
these differences are described below 
the adjustments required to reconcile from the company s base net income measure to its gaap results of operations relate to differing treatments for derivatives  foreign currency transaction adjustments  discontinued operations  and certain other items that management does not consider in evaluating the company s operating results 
the following table reflects adjustments associated with these areas by operating segment and corporate activity and overhead for the years ended december    and student tuition enrollment asset loan payment services software corporate generation and processing and and activity and guaranty and campus list technical and management servicing commerce management services overhead total year ended december  derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments amortization of intangible assets compensation related to business combinations variable rate floor income income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net tax effect a total adjustments to gaap year ended december  derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments amortization of intangible assets compensation related to business combinations variable rate floor income income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net tax effect a total adjustments to gaap year ended december  derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments amortization of intangible assets compensation related to business combinations variable rate floor income income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net tax effect a total adjustments to gaap a tax effect computed at 
the change in the value of the put option included in corporate activity and overhead is not tax effected as this is not deductible for income tax purposes 

table of contents differences between gaap and base net income management s financial planning and evaluation of operating results does not take into account the following items because their volatility and or inherent uncertainty affect the period to period comparability of the company s results of operations 
a more detailed discussion of the differences between gaap and base net income follows 
derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments base net income excludes the periodic unrealized gains and losses that are caused by the change in fair value on derivatives in which the company does not qualify for hedge treatment under gaap 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 requires that changes in fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria  as specified by sfas no 
 are met 
the company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility 
derivative instruments primarily used by the company include interest rate swaps  basis swaps  interest rate floor contracts  and cross currency interest rate swaps 
management has structured all of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the company does not qualify its derivatives for hedge treatment as defined by sfas no 
 and the stand alone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item 
the company believes these point in time estimates of asset and liability values that are subject to interest rate fluctuations make it difficult to evaluate the ongoing results of operations against its business plan and affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
included in base net income are the economic effects of the company s derivative instruments  which includes any cash paid or received being recognized as an expense or revenue upon actual derivative settlements 
these settlements are included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income 
base net income excludes the foreign currency transaction gains or losses caused by the re measurement of the company s euro denominated bonds to us dollars 
in connection with the issuance of the euro denominated bonds  the company has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps 
under the terms of these agreements  the principal payments on the euro denominated notes will effectively be paid at the exchange rate in effect at the issuance date of the bonds 
the cross currency interest rate swaps also convert the floating rate paid on the euro denominated bonds euribor index to an index based on libor 
included in base net income are the economic effects of any cash paid or received being recognized as an expense or revenue upon actual settlements of the cross currency interest rate swaps 
these settlements are included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income 
however  the gains or losses caused by the re measurement of the euro denominated bonds to us dollars and the change in market value of the cross currency interest rate swaps are excluded from base net income as the company believes the point in time estimates of value that are subject to currency rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments make it difficult to evaluate the ongoing results of operations against the company s business plan and affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
the re measurement of the euro denominated bonds correlates with the change in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps 
however  the company will experience unrealized gains or losses related to the cross currency interest rate swaps if the two underlying indices and related forward curve do not move in parallel 
base net income also excludes the change in fair value of put options issued by the company for certain business acquisitions 
the put options are valued by the company each reporting period using a black scholes pricing model 
therefore  the fair value of these options is primarily affected by the strike price and term of the underlying option  the company s current stock price  and the dividend yield and volatility of the company s stock 
the company believes these point in time estimates of value that are subject to fluctuations make it difficult to evaluate the ongoing results of operations against the company s business plans and affects the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
the gains and or losses included in derivative market value  foreign currency  and put option adjustments and derivative settlements  net on the company s consolidated statements of income are primarily caused by interest rate and currency volatility  changes in the value of put options based on the inputs used in the black scholes pricing model  as well as the volume and terms of put options and of derivatives not receiving hedge treatment 
base net income excludes these unrealized gains and losses and isolates the effect of interest rate  currency  and put option volatility on the fair value of such instruments during the period 
under gaap  the effects of these factors on the fair value of the put options and the derivative instruments but not the underlying hedged item tend to show more volatility in the short term 
amortization of intangible assets base net income excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles  which arises primarily from the acquisition of definite life intangible assets in connection with the company s acquisitions  since the company feels that such charges do not drive the company s operating performance on a long term basis and can affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
compensation related to business combinations the company has structured certain business combinations in which the consideration paid has been dependent on the sellers continued employment with the company 
as such  the value of the consideration paid is recognized as compensation expense by the company over the term of the applicable employment agreement 

table of contents base net income excludes this expense because the company believes such charges do not drive its operating performance on a long term basis and can affect the period to period comparability of the results of operations 
if the company did not enter into the employment agreements in connection with the acquisition  the amount paid to these former shareholders of the acquired entity would have been recorded by the company as additional consideration of the acquired entity  thus  not having an effect on the company s results of operations 
variable rate floor income loans that reset annually on july can generate excess spread income compared with the rate based on the special allowance payment formula in declining interest rate environments 
the company refers to this additional income as variable rate floor income 
the company excludes variable rate floor income from its base net income since its timing and amount if any is uncertain  it has been eliminated by legislation for all loans originated on and after april   and it is in excess of expected spreads 
in addition  because variable rate floor income is subject to the underlying rate for the subject loans being reset annually on july  it is a factor beyond the company s control which can affect the period to period comparability of results of operations 
variable rate floor income is calculated by the company on a statutory basis 
as a result of the disruptions in the debt and secondary capital markets beginning in august  the benefit of variable rate floor income has not been realized by the company due to the widening of the spread between short term interest rate indices and the company s actual cost of funds 
the company entered into interest rate swaps with effective dates beginning in january to hedge a portion of the variable rate floor income 
settlements on these derivatives will be presented as part of the company s statutory calculation of variable rate floor income 
discontinued operations in may  the company sold edulinx 
as a result of this transaction  the results of operations for edulinx are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the company presents base net income excluding discontinued operations since the operations and cash flows of edulinx have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company 
asset generation and management operating segment results of operations the asset generation and management segment includes the acquisition  management  and ownership of the company s student loan assets 
revenues are primarily generated from net interest income on the student loan assets 
the company generates student loan assets through direct origination or through acquisitions 
the student loan assets are held in a series of education lending subsidiaries designed specifically for this purpose 
in addition to the student loan portfolio  all costs and activity associated with the generation of assets  funding of those assets  and maintenance of the debt transactions are included in this segment 
this includes derivative activity and the related derivative market value and foreign currency adjustments 
the company is also able to leverage its capital market expertise by providing investment advisory services and other related services to third parties through a licensed broker dealer subsidiary 
revenues and expenses for those functions are also included in the asset generation and management segment

the company will originate or acquire loans through its campus based channel either directly under one of its brand names or through other originating lenders 
in addition to its brands  the company acquires student loans from lenders to whom the company provides marketing and or origination services established through various contracts 
branding partners are lenders for which the company acts as a marketing agent in specified geographic areas 
a forward flow lender is one for whom the company provides origination services but provides no marketing services or whom simply agrees to sell loans to the company under forward sale commitments

this reclassification was made for comparative purposes due to the nature of the transactions 
during and  the company originated billion and billion of consolidation loans  respectively 
with the changes in legislation and impact of capital markets  the company has suspended consolidation loan originations in january the other channels for the year ended december  includes million of student loans purchased from union bank and trust union bank  an entity under common control with the company 
the acquisition of these loans was made by the company as part of an agreement with union bank entered into in february as part of this agreement  union bank also committed to transfer to the company substantially all of the remaining balance of union bank s origination rights in guaranteed student loans 
as such  beginning in the second quarter of  all loans originated by union bank on behalf of the company are presented in the table above as direct channel originations 
loans acquired in portfolio and business acquisitions for the year ended december  includes billion and billion of student loans purchased in october from chela education funding  inc chela and loanstar funding group  inc

nova southeastern university nova  a school as lender customer  elected not to renew their existing contract with the company  which expired in december total loans acquired from nova were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
loans acquired from nova are included in the forward flow channel in the above table 

table of contents as part of the company s asset management strategy  the company periodically sells student loan portfolios to third parties 
during the years ended december  and  the company sold million and million par value  respectively  of student loans resulting in the recognition of gains of million and million  respectively 
there were no loans sold during the year ended december  legislative and credit market impact to student loan originations and acquisitions the college cost reduction act has resulted in a reduction in the yields on student loans and  accordingly  a reduction in the amount of the premium the company is able to pay lenders under its forward flow commitments and branding partner arrangements 
as a result  the company has been working with its forward flow and branding partner clients to renegotiate the premiums payable under its agreements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in renegotiating the premiums under these agreements and  accordingly  the company may be required to terminate commitments which are not economically reasonable 
as a result  the company will experience a decrease in its forward flow and branding partner loan volume 
the company has also had to terminate its affinity and referral programs and accordingly will experience a decrease in loan volume as a result 
the company s primary funding needs are those required to finance its student loan portfolio and satisfy its cash requirements for new student loan originations and acquisitions 
the company relies upon secured financing vehicles as its most significant source of funding for student loans 
current conditions in the debt markets include reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums for most market participants 
these conditions have increased the cost and reduced the availability of debt in the capital markets 
as a result  a prolonged period of market illiquidity will affect the company s loan acquisition and origination volumes 
as previously discussed  as a result of the disruptions in the capital markets  the company plans to be more selective in pursuing origination activity in both the direct to consumer and campus based channels

d variable rate floor income is calculated by the company on a statutory basis 
as a result of the disruptions in the debt and secondary capital markets which began in august  the benefit of variable rate floor income has not been realized by the company due to the widening of the spread between short term interest rate indices and the company s actual cost of funds 
the company entered into interest rate swaps with effective dates beginning in january to hedge a portion of the variable rate floor income 
settlements on these derivatives will be presented as part of the company s statutory calculation of variable rate floor income 
e the special allowance yield adjustment represents the impact on net spread had certain loans earned at statutorily defined rates under a taxable financing 
the special allowance yield adjustment includes net settlements on derivative instruments that were used to hedge this loan portfolio earning the excess yield 
on january   the company entered into a settlement agreement with the department to resolve the audit by the oig of the company s portfolio of student loans receiving special allowance payments 
under the terms of the agreement  all special allowance payments were eliminated for periods on and after july  the company had been deferring recognition of special allowance payments related to those loans subject to the oig audit effective july  pending satisfactory resolution of this issue 
the compression of the company s core student loan spread during the year ended december  compared to and has been primarily due to i the increase in the cost of debt as a result of the disruptions in the debt and secondary capital markets  ii an increase in lower yielding consolidation loans and an increase in the consolidation rebate fees  and iii the elimination of special allowance payments on non special allowance yield adjustment student loans as a result of the settlement agreement with the department 
additional compression during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to the mismatch in the reset frequency between the company s floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities 
the company s core student loan spread benefited in the rising interest rate environment for the first six months in because the company s cost of funds reset periodically on a discrete basis  in advance  while the company s student loans received a yield based on the average daily interest rate over the period 
as interest rates remained relatively flat or decreased during  as compared to the same period in  the company did not benefit from the rate reset discrepancy of its assets and liabilities contributing to the compression 
during  the company entered into basis swaps in which the company receives three month libor set discretely in advance and pays a daily weighted average three month libor less a spread as defined in the individual agreements 
the company entered into these derivative instruments to better match the interest rate characteristics on its student loan assets and the debt funding such assets 
the company expects the impact of these derivatives will diminish the effects of these rate reset discrepancies in future periods 
as a result of the passage of the college cost reduction act  the yield on ffelp loans originated after october  was reduced 
the core student loan spread on these loans for the fourth quarter of was approximately to basis points 
as noted in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  the company has a portfolio of student loans that are earning interest at a fixed borrower rate which exceeds the statutorily defined variable lender rate creating fixed rate floor income which is included in its core student loan spread 
the majority of these loans are consolidation loans that earn the greater of the borrower rate or above the average commercial paper rate during the calendar quarter

table of contents operating expenses 
operating expenses increased as a result of the acquisition of in november liquidity and capital resources the company utilizes operating cash flow  operating lines of credit  and secured financing transactions to fund operations and student loan and business acquisitions 
the company has also used its common stock to partially fund certain business acquisitions 
in addition  the company has a universal shelf registration statement with the sec which allows the company to sell up to million of securities that may consist of common stock  preferred stock  unsecured debt securities  warrants  stock purchase contracts  and stock purchase units 
the terms of any securities are established at the time of the offering 
the company has significant financing needs that it meets through the capital markets  including the debt and secondary markets 
these markets are currently experiencing unprecedented disruptions  which are having an adverse impact on the company s earnings and financial condition  particularly in the short term 
current conditions in the debt markets include reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums for most market participants 
these conditions can increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt in the capital markets 
the company attempts to mitigate the impact of debt market disruptions by obtaining adequate committed and uncommitted facilities from a variety of reliable sources 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in these efforts  that such facilities will be adequate  or that the cost of debt will allow the company to operate at profitable levels 
since the company is dependent on the availability of credit to finance its operations  disruptions in the debt markets or a reduction in the company s credit ratings could have an adverse impact on the company s earnings and financial condition  particularly in the short term 
while management believes the company has a strong capital base and adequate liquidity and the company has capacity to grow its student loan portfolio  the company s ability to acquire and hold student loans is not unlimited 
as a result  a prolonged period of market illiquidity may affect the company s loan acquisition volumes and could have an adverse impact on the company s future earnings and financial condition 
since the company cannot determine nor control the length of time or extent to which the capital markets remain disrupted  it will reduce its direct and indirect costs related to its asset generation activities and be more selective in pursuing origination activity  in both the school and direct to consumer channels  for both private loans and ffelp loans 
accordingly  the company has suspended consolidation student loan originations and will continue to review the viability of continuing to originate and acquire student loans through its various channels 
as a result of these items  the company will experience a decrease in origination volume compared to historical periods 
the decrease in origination volume will reduce the company s financing needs from historical periods

secured financing transactions the company relies upon secured financing vehicles as its most significant source of funding for student loans 
the net cash flow the company receives from the securitized student loans generally represents the excess amounts  if any  generated by the underlying student loans over the amounts required to be paid to the bondholders  after deducting servicing fees and any other expenses relating to the securitizations 
the company s rights to cash flow from securitized student loans are subordinate to bondholder interests and may fail to generate any cash flow beyond what is due to bondholders 
the company s secured financing vehicles are loan warehouse facilities and asset backed securitizations 

table of contents loan warehouse facilities student loan warehousing allows the company to buy and manage student loans prior to transferring them into more permanent financing arrangements 
the company uses its warehouse facilities to pool student loans in order to maximize loan portfolio characteristics for efficient financing and to properly time market conditions for movement of the loans 
because transferring those loans to a long term securitization includes certain fixed administrative costs  the company has historically sought to maximize economies of scale by executing large transactions 
the company relies upon three conduit warehouse loan financing vehicles to support its funding needs on a short term basis a multi seller bank provided conduit with billion of committed funding for ffelp loans  a private loan warehouse with million in authorized financing for non federally insured student loans  and a single seller extendible commercial paper conduit authorized to fund up to billion in ffelp loans 
the multi year committed facility for ffelp loans  which terminates in may  is supported by day liquidity which is up for renewal in may in order to continue funding new originations  the company s liquidity must be renewed 
if not renewed  the company will be unable to fund new originations in the facility 
if the company is able to renew its liquidity on this line  it will come at an increased cost compared to historical periods 
if the company is not able to renew the liquidity on this facility or renew the facility at a price acceptable to the company  it becomes a term facility with a maturity date of may the company s cost of financing on the term facility would be slightly higher than its current cost of funds as a warehouse facility 
if the company s warehouse facility becomes a term facility  the company will need to use or secure alternate financing to fund new ffelp student loan originations or acquisitions 
as of december   billion was outstanding under this facility and billion was available for future use 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to maintain this conduit facility  find alternative funding  or increase the commitment level of such facility  if necessary 
while the company s bank supported conduit facilities have historically been renewed for successive terms  there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future 
the ffelp warehouse facility has a provision requiring the company to refinance or remove on an annual basis of the pledged collateral 
in accordance with this provision  the company anticipates refinancing or removing billion to billion of ffelp loans from this facility by may the terms and conditions of the company s warehouse facility for ffelp loans provide for advance rates related to financed loans subject to a valuation formula based on current market conditions 
dislocation in the credit markets including disruptions in the current capital markets can and will cause short term volatility in the loan valuation formulas 
severe volatility and dislocation in the credit markets  although temporary  could cause the valuation assigned to its student loan portfolio financed by the applicable line to be less than par 
should a significant change in the valuation of subject loans result in a reduction in advance rate and require equity support greater than what the company can or is willing to provide  the warehouse line could be subject to termination 
while the company does not believe the loan valuation formula is reflective of the fair market value of its loans  it is subject to compliance with provisions of the warehouse documents 
as of february   the company has million utilized as equity funding support based on provisions of this agreement of which all has been required to be posted since december  as a result of adverse credit market conditions 
the private loan warehouse facility is an uncommitted facility that is offered to the company by one banking partner  which terminates in january as of december   million was outstanding under this facility and million was available for future use 
the company guarantees the performance of the assets in the private loan warehouse facility 
this facility provides for advance rates on subject collateral which require certain levels of equity enhancement support 
as of february   the company has million utilized as equity funding support based on provisions of this agreement of which all has been required to be posted since december  as a result of adverse credit market conditions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain this conduit facility  find alternative funding  increase the size of the facility  or make adequate equity contributions  if necessary

in august  the company established a billion extendible commercial paper warehouse program for ffelp loans under which it can issue one or more short term extendable secured liquidity notes the secured liquidity notes 
each secured liquidity note will be issued at a discount or an interest bearing basis having an expected maturity of between and days each  an expected maturity and a final maturity of days following the expected maturity 
the secured liquidity notes issued as interest bearing notes may be issued with fixed interest rates or with interest rates that fluctuate based upon a one month libor rate  a three month libor rate  a commercial paper rate  or a federal funds rate 
the secured liquidity notes are not redeemable by the company nor subject to voluntary prepayment prior to the expected maturity date 
the secured liquidity notes are secured by ffelp loans purchased in connection with the program 
as of december   the company has no secured liquidity notes outstanding under this warehouse program 
during the third and fourth quarters of  as a result of the disruption of the credit markets  there was no market for the issuance of new secured liquidity notes and management believes it is unlikely a market will exist in the future 

table of contents asset backed securitizations of the billion of debt outstanding as of december   billion was issued under term asset backed securitizations 
depending on market conditions  the company anticipates continuing to access the asset backed securities market 
as a result of the disruptions in the credit markets  the company may not be able to issue asset backed financings at rates historically achieved by the company  at levels equal to or less than other financing agreements  or at levels otherwise considered beneficial to the company 
accordingly  the company s operational and financial results may be negatively impacted 
securities issued in the securitization transactions are generally priced based upon a spread to libor or set under an auction or remarketing procedure 
libor based notes as of december   the company had billion of notes issued under asset backed securitizations that primarily reprice at a fixed spread to month libor and are structured to match the maturity of the funded assets 
these notes fund student loans that are primarily set based on a spread to month commercial paper 
the month libor and month commercial paper indexes have rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time 
assuming this high correlation is not disrupted by capital market disruptions or other factors and the prepayments and default rates on the student loans included in these asset backed securitizations meet management s expectations and estimates  the company expects future cash flows to the company for net spread  servicing  and administration from these facilities will be in excess of billion 
auction or remarketing based notes the interest rates on certain of the company s asset backed securities are set and periodically reset via a dutch auction auction rate securities or through a remarketing utilizing broker dealers and remarketing agents variable rate demand notes 
the company is currently sponsor on approximately billion of auction rate securities and billion of variable rate demand notes 
for auction rate securities  investors and potential investors submit orders through a broker dealer as to the principal amount of notes they wish to buy  hold  or sell at various interest rates 
the broker dealers submit their clients orders to the auction agent  who then determines the clearing interest rate for the upcoming period 
interest rates on these auction rate securities are reset periodically  generally every to days  by the auction agent or agents 
recently  as part of the ongoing credit market crisis  several auction rate securities from various issuers have failed to receive sufficient order interest from potential investors to clear successfully  resulting in failed auction status 
since february   the company s auction rate securities have failed in this manner 
under normal conditions  banks have historically stepped in when investor demand is weak 
however  as of recently  banks have been allowing these auctions to fail 
as a result of a failed auction  the auction rate securities will generally pay interest to the holder at a maximum rate as defined by the governing documents or indenture 
while these rates will vary slightly by class of security  they will generally be based on a spread to libor or treasury securities and will approximate the current one month libor rate plus to basis points 
these maximum rates are subject to increase if the credit ratings on the bonds are downgraded 
the company cannot predict whether future auctions related to its auction rate securities will be successful 
the company is currently seeking alternatives for reducing its exposure to the auction rate market  but may not be able to achieve alternate financing for some or all of its auction rate securities 
for variable rate demand notes  the remarketing agents set the price  which is then offered to investors 
if there are insufficient potential bid orders to purchase all of the notes offered for sale  the company could be subject to interest costs substantially above the anticipated and historical rates paid on these types of securities 
the maximum rate for variable rate demand notes is based on a spread to certain indexes as defined in the underlying documents with the highest to the company being prime plus basis points 
certain of the variable rate demand notes are secured by financial guaranty insurance policies issued by municipal bond investors assurance mbia 
the variable rate demand notes insured by mbia are currently experiencing reduced investor demand and certain of these securities have been put to the liquidity provider  lloyds tsb bank  at a cost ranging from federal funds plus basis points to libor plus basis points

critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
note of the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are most critical that is  they are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has identified the following critical accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below allowance for loan losses  revenue recognition  purchase price accounting related to business and certain asset acquisitions  and income taxes 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses on student loans 
this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on its federally insured loan portfolio separately from its non federally insured loan portfolio 
the allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios considering past experience  trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  changes to federal student loan programs  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the level of the company s future provision for loan losses 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on the non federally insured loans  the company considers several factors including loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  months in repayment  delinquency status  type of program  and trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the level of the company s future provision for loan losses 
the company places a non federally insured loan on nonaccrual status and charges off the loan when the collection of principal and interest is days past due 

table of contents the allowance for federally insured and non federally insured loans is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
revenue recognition student loan income the company recognizes student loan income as earned  net of amortization of loan premiums and deferred origination costs 
loan income is recognized based upon the expected yield of the loan after giving effect to borrower utilization of incentives such as principal reductions for timely payments borrower benefits and other yield adjustments 
the estimate of the borrower benefits discount is dependent on the estimate of the number of borrowers who will eventually qualify for these benefits 
for competitive purposes  the company frequently changes the borrower benefit programs in both amount and qualification factors 
these programmatic changes must be reflected in the estimate of the borrower benefit discount 
loan premiums  deferred origination costs  and borrower benefits are included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the estimated life of the loan in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for non refundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
the most sensitive estimate for loan premiums  deferred origination costs  and borrower benefits is the estimate of the constant prepayment rate cpr 
cpr is a variable in the life of loan estimate that measures the rate at which loans in a portfolio pay before their stated maturity 
the cpr is directly correlated to the average life of the portfolio 
cpr equals the percentage of loans that prepay annually as a percentage of the beginning of period balance 
a number of factors can affect the cpr estimate such as the rate of consolidation activity and default rates 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the amount of loan premium and deferred origination cost amortization recognized by the company in a particular period 
other fee based income other fee based income is primarily attributable to fees for providing services and the sale of lists and print products 
fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company s service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties 
revenue from the sale of lists and print products is generally earned and recognized  net of estimated returns  upon shipment or delivery 
the company assesses collectibility of revenues and our allowance for doubtful accounts based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to record accounts receivable at estimated net realizable value 
if the company determines that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured at or prior to delivery of our services  revenue is recognized upon the receipt of cash 
purchase price accounting related to business and certain asset acquisitions the company has completed several business and asset acquisitions which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization 
the values assigned to goodwill and intangibles  as well as their related useful lives  are subject to judgment and estimation by the company 
goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined and based on purchase price allocations 
valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets  while the initial value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
thereafter  the value of goodwill cannot be greater than the excess of fair value of the company s reportable unit over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities  based on an annual impairment test 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of the benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including historical cash flows 
due to the number of estimates involved related to the allocation of purchase price and determining the appropriate useful lives of intangible assets  management has identified purchase price accounting as a critical accounting policy 
income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the u 
s and its states and municipalities in which the company operates 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  the company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
the company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
the company reviews these balances quarterly and as new information becomes available  the balances are adjusted  as appropriate

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure arises from fluctuations in its borrowing and lending rates  the spread between which could impact the company due to shifts in market interest rates 
because the company generates a significant portion of its earnings from its student loan spread  the interest sensitivity of the balance sheet is a key profitability driver 
the following table sets forth the company s loan assets and debt instruments by rate characteristics as of december  as of december  dollars percent dollars percent fixed rate loan assets variable rate loan assets total fixed rate debt instruments variable rate debt instruments total ffelp student loans generally earn interest at the higher of a floating rate based on the special allowance payment or sap formula set by the department and the borrower rate  which is fixed over a period of time 
the sap formula is based on an applicable index plus a fixed spread that is dependant upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
the company generally finances its student loan portfolio with variable rate debt 
in low and or declining interest rate environments  when the fixed borrower rate is higher than the rate produced by the sap formula  the company s student loans earn at a fixed rate while the interest on the variable rate debt continues to decline 
in these interest rate environments  the company earns additional spread income that it refers to as fixed rate floor income 
for the years ended december  and  loan interest income includes approximately million and million of fixed rate floor income 
depending on the type of the student loan and when it was originated  the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to market rate each july as a result  for loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term  the company earns floor income for an extended period of time  which the company refers to as fixed rate floor income  and for those loans where the borrower rate is reset annually on july  the company earns floor income to the next reset date  which the company refers to as variable rate floor income 
in accordance with new legislation enacted in  lenders are required to rebate floor income and variable rate floor income to the department for all new ffelp loans originated on or after april  absent the use of derivative instruments  a rise in interest rates may reduce the amount of floor income received and this may have an impact on earnings due to interest margin compression caused by increasing financing costs  until such time as the federally insured loans earn interest at a variable rate in accordance with the special allowance payment formula 
in higher interest rate environments  where the interest rate rises above the borrower rate and fixed rate loans effectively become variable rate loans  the impact of the rate fluctuations is reduced 

table of contents the following graph depicts fixed rate floor income for a borrower with a fixed rate of and a sap rate of chart the following table shows the company s student loan assets that are earning fixed rate floor income as of december  borrower estimated balance of fixed lender variable assets earning fixed rate interest weighted conversion floor income as of rate range average yield rate a december  b a the estimated variable conversion rate is the estimated short term interest rate at which loans would convert to variable rate 
b as of december   the company had of fixed rate debt that was used by the company to hedge fixed rate student loan assets 
the weighted average interest rate paid by the company on this debt as of december  was 
subsequent to december   there has been a decrease in short term interest rates 
as a result of these decreases  the following student loan assets are currently earning fixed rate floor income in addition to those presented above borrower estimated balance of fixed lender variable assets earning fixed rate interest weighted conversion floor income as of rate range average yield rate december  
table of contents in december and january  the company entered into the following interest rate derivatives to hedge fixed rate student loan assets 
weighted average fixed notional rate paid by maturity amount the company a  b  b  c  d a for all interest rate derivatives  the company receives discrete three month libor 
b derivative s have an effective start date in the first quarter c million notional amount of derivative s have an effective start date in the first quarter of and  respectively 
d derivative s have an effective start date in the first quarter as of december   the company had billion of student loan assets that were earning variable rate floor income 
the majority of these loans were originated prior to january  as such  the company was earning loan interest income on these loans based on the treasury bill index 
as of december   the weighted average variable rate floor strike rate on this portfolio was 
the company was funding this portfolio primarily with variable rate debt not indexed to treasury bill 
because of the recent credit market disruptions  the spread between treasury bill and libor indexes widened which resulted in an increase in funding costs on this loan portfolio 
the increase in funding costs related to this portfolio offset the positive impact of the variable rate floor income earned during subsequent to december   short term interest rates have continued to decline 
as a result of this decline  the company began to earn variable rate floor income on billion of additional student loan assets 
the company is earning loan interest income on these loans based on the commercial paper index 
on a weighted average basis  this portfolio earns variable rate floor income to the extent that the commercial paper rate falls below approximately 
in december and january  the company entered into interest rate derivatives with a notional amount of billion and a weighted average fixed rate paid by the company of to hedge a portion of its student loans earning variable rate floor income 
these derivatives have an effective date subsequent to december  and the maturity date is june  the company is exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk because the interest rate characteristics of the company s assets do not match the interest rate characteristics of the funding

based on those factors  the company uses derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy 
derivative instruments used as part of the company s interest rate risk management strategy currently include interest rate swaps  basis swaps  and cross currency swaps
