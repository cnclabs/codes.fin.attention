item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we develop and license rules based bpm software and provide professional services  maintenance  and training related to our software 
we focus our sales efforts on target accounts  which are companies or divisions within companies  and are typically large organizations that are among the leaders in their industry 
our strategy is to sell limited size initial licenses to these target accounts rather than selling large application licenses  with the goal to generate follow on sales 
this strategy allows our customers to quickly realize business value from our software and reduces their initial investment 
our customers typically request professional services and training to assist them in implementing our products 
almost all of our customers also purchase maintenance on our products  which includes rights to upgrades and new releases  incident resolution and technical assistance 
professional services are provided directly by us in some situations and through our network of partners in other cases 
the amount of professional services provided by our partners has been increasing in recent years 
by utilizing these partners  we have significantly increased the supply of skilled service consultants that can assist our customers 
our license revenue from new license signings is primarily derived from our pegarules process commander software and related solution frameworks 
pegarules process commander is a comprehensive platform for building and managing bpm applications that unifies business rules and business processes 
our solution frameworks are built on the capabilities of pegarules process commander and are purpose or industry specific collections of best practice functionality to allow organizations to quickly implement new customer facing practices and processes  bring new offerings to market  and provide customized or specialized processing 
these products often require less implementation assistance than prior generations of our software products 
in many cases this has resulted in a shorter sales process and implementation period 
pegarules process commander and related solution frameworks can be used more broadly by customers within our traditional financial services  insurance and healthcare markets  as well as by a broader range of customers within other markets  such as life sciences and government 
we license our software to new customers pursuant to perpetual and term license agreements  depending on customer circumstances 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from two primary sources software license fees and service fees 
our license arrangements  whether involving a perpetual license or a term license  generally contain multiple elements 
in addition to the license  these elements generally include professional consulting services  training  and software maintenance services 
revenue from arrangements in which the fair value of one or more undelivered elements is unknown is deferred until the fair value of those elements is known and the residual value of the license can be determined 

table of contents software license revenues perpetual software license fees are recognized as revenue when the software is delivered  any acceptance required by contract is obtained  no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software  other than maintenance support  and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
term software license fees are generally payable on a monthly basis under license agreements that typically have a three to five year term and may be renewed for additional terms at the customer s option 
as a result of our focus on frequent sales to our targeted customers  our strategy to sell limited size initial term licensing agreements to those customers with the goal to generate follow on sales  and as a result of certain contract provisions  we recognize term license revenue over the term of the agreement as payments become due or earlier if prepaid  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
historically  the majority of our term license arrangements were larger agreements with extended payment terms and therefore  did not typically result in follow on license agreements 
we have a history of successfully collecting payments under the original payment terms  therefore for these arrangements  we have recognized the present value of the future term license payments upon customer acceptance  provided that no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software  other than maintenance support  and provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
a portion of the license fees payable under these agreements equal to the difference between the total license payments and the discounted present value of those payments was initially deferred and recognized as installment receivable interest income and is not part of total revenue over the license term 
for purposes of the present value calculations  the discount rates used were estimates of customers borrowing rates at the time of recognition  typically below prime rate  and have varied between and for the past few years 
as of december   the remaining balance of these installment receivables totaled approximately million as summarized in the table on page for licensing arrangements that include a right to unspecified future products  fees are accounted for as subscriptions and the revenue is recognized ratably over the economic life or term of the arrangement 
services revenues our services revenue is comprised of fees for software maintenance  training  and consulting services including software implementation 
consulting services may be provided on a stand alone basis or bundled with a license and software maintenance services 
software maintenance revenue is recognized over the term of the related maintenance agreement  which is generally one year 
revenue from training services and consulting services under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are performed 
we have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for our software maintenance  training services  and consulting services under time and materials contracts 
services may be provided on a fixed price basis 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for fixed price services prior to completion of the services 
when fixed price services are part of a multiple element arrangement  and the services are not essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement  and when services are the only undelivered element  we recognize the revenue from the total arrangement ratably over the longer of the software maintenance period or the service period 
in a limited number of our arrangements  the fixed price services are essential to the arrangement because we make significant alterations to the functionality of the software or build complex interfaces necessary for the software to be functional in the customer s environment 
we have not been able to make reasonably dependable estimates for the purpose of determining our progress to completion  as we have limited experience with these types of unique and complex arrangements 
accordingly  when the fixed price services are essential to the arrangement  all revenue and costs are deferred until the completion of the fixed price services under the completed contract method 
revenue from fixed price services that are not bundled with a software license is generally recognized as performed during the service period  which is typically less than four months 

table of contents we warrant to our customers that our software products will conform to documented specifications 
we have not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support  which we are already obligated to provide  and consequently we have not established reserves for warranty obligations 
our agreements with customers generally require us to indemnify the customer against claims that our software infringes third party patent  copyright  trademark or other proprietary rights 
such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry standard respects  including our right to replace an infringing product 
as of december   we had not experienced any material losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding 
we do not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations  and consequently  we have not established any related reserves 
deferred project costs we defer direct costs when a project is being accounted for under the completed contract method or for certain arrangements where all of the required revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
we report these deferred project costs in other current assets 
deferred revenue deferred revenue consists primarily of billed fees that exceed revenue recognized on arrangements and advance payment of maintenance fees 
allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for sales credit memos we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our estimates are based on the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different assumptions  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate that resulted in their inability to make required payments  additional provisions for doubtful accounts would be required and would increase bad debt expense 
we record allowances for estimates of potential sales credit memos 
we base these estimates on historical analyses of sales credit memos and assumptions about future events and experience with customer disputes 
if we used different assumptions in calculating the allowance  adjustments would be reflected as changes to revenue 
stock based compensation as a result of the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r on january   we recognize stock based compensation expense associated with equity awards in our consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective method  and  accordingly prior period amounts were not restated 
stock based compensation is recognized over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the equity award  and adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures 
we recognize stock based compensation under the ratable method  which treats each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant 
during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved changes to our equity compensation program  including the granting of restricted stock units rsus in addition to stock options  for periodic equity compensation grants 
rsus deliver to the recipient a right to receive a specified number of shares of our 
table of contents common stock upon vesting 
unlike stock options  there is no cost to the employee at share issuance 
we value our rsus at the fair value of our common stock on the grant date  which is the closing price of our common stock on the grant date  less the present value of expected dividends as the employee is not entitled to dividends during the requisite service period 
we periodically grant stock options and rsus for a fixed number of shares to employees and non employee directors 
the exercise price for stock options is greater than or equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of the grant 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires us to make estimates of key assumptions including the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of our stock price over the option s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the option s expected term  and our expected annual dividend yield 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price 
the expected annual dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend of per share divided by the average stock price 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
the following table summarizes the estimated impact on the fair value of our stock options granted during the years ended december  and  respectively  had we applied different weighted average assumptions in the black scholes option valuation model as follows sfas r assumption year ended december  hypothetical change estimated impact on stock based compensation expected volatility expected term in years risk free interest rate expected annual dividend yield sfas r assumption year ended december  hypothetical change estimated impact on stock based compensation expected volatility expected term in years risk free interest rate expected annual dividend yield the amount of stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
based on the review of historical forfeiture data for our employees  we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of and re evaluate and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary 
ultimately  we recognize the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest 
the choice of a valuation model  and the underlying assumptions used in applying that model  involves significant judgment 
our judgment reflects our assessment of the most accurate method of valuing the stock options we issue based on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
our judgment could change over time as additional information becomes available to us  or the facts underlying our assumptions change over time  and any change in our judgments could have a material effect on our financial statements 
prior to january   we accounted for stock option grants to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation associated with stock awards to 
table of contents employees and directors was determined as the difference  if any  between the current fair value of the underlying common stock on the date compensation was measured and the exercise price of the award 
in accordance with the provisions of apb  since the exercise price of our employee stock options equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  no compensation expense was recorded in the financial statements 
however  we disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements the pro forma effect on our consolidated statements of income had we employed the fair value method of accounting for stock option grants in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
for purposes of that disclosure  we used the black scholes option valuation model to value the options granted  which required us to make certain assumptions similar to those required by sfas r and as described above  except the dividend yield was equal to zero  as no dividends had been declared through december  see note stock based compensation in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on the impact of sfas r to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes as a global company  we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates 
we estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and estimate the probability for such outcomes in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which we adopted on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recorded a million reduction to january  retained earnings 
in accordance with fin  as of december   the amount of unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately million  of which million  if recognized would favorably affect our effective tax rate in any future period 
we do not expect the changes in the unrecognized benefits within the next twelve months to be material 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  returns  and accruals 
such differences  or changes in estimates relating to potential differences  could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made

other components of the increase in professional services and training revenue include million in revenue from three large fixed fee contracts which were completed in  a million increase in billed expenses and million increase in training revenue 
typically  we derive substantial revenue from services provided in connection with the implementation of software licensed by new customers 
maintenance revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in maintenance revenue for was due to a larger installed base of software and a higher proportion of perpetual licenses in the installed base which yield greater maintenance revenue than term licenses

deferred revenue decreased to million as of december   from million as of december  the million decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in the deferred revenue associated with agreements containing customer acceptances or completion of fixed price services engagements  partially offset by a million increase in the unearned portions of annual maintenance fees paid in advance 
international revenue increased to of total revenue for from for this increase was primarily related to one large international license transaction in the third quarter of our international revenue may fluctuate in the future because such revenue is generally dependent upon a small number of license transactions during a given period

we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our business for at least the next twelve months 
material risks to cash flow from operations include delayed or reduced cash payments accompanying sales of new licenses or a decline in our services business 
there can be no assurance that changes in our plans or other events affecting our operations will not result in materially accelerated or unexpected expenditures 
as of december   we had material commitments for purchases of customer support and consulting services  and payments under operating leases

we also lease space for our other offices in the us  canada  australia  france  and the united kingdom 
these leases expire at various dates through rent expense under operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis to account for scheduled rent increases 
the excess of expense over current payments is recorded as deferred rent and included in other long term liabilities 
in july  the company entered into an agreement to lease additional space in its cambridge  massachusetts facility 
the lease for this additional space expires in  subject to our option to extend for two additional five year periods

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions to manage risk in connection with such fluctuations 
foreign currency exposure we derived approximately   and of our total revenue from sales to customers based outside of the us in   and  respectively 
our international sales may be denominated in us dollars or foreign currencies depending on the customer and transaction 
however  the operating expenses of our foreign operations are primarily denominated in foreign currencies 
to the extent the international sales are also denominated in the foreign currency  our foreign currency exposure is largely offset 
an increase in the value of foreign currencies  particularly the british pound and the euro relative to the us dollar  could adversely impact our revenues and operating results 
there can be no assurance that sales denominated in foreign currencies will not be material in the future 
most of our transactions with customers are invoiced from our offices in the us for those transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  we have receivables and license installments that are valued in foreign currencies 
in addition  our us operating company holds cash and investments in foreign currencies in order to support our foreign operations 
our functional currency is the us dollar  therefore  when there are changes in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar  we recognize a foreign currency transaction gain or loss in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of income 
we had net assets valued in foreign currencies  consisting primarily of cash  investments  license installments  and receivables  partially offset by accounts payable and accruals  with a carrying value of approximately million as of december  as of december   a ten percent change in foreign currency exchange rates would have changed the carrying value of our net assets by approximately million as of that date with a corresponding currency gain loss recognized in our consolidated statement of income 
interest rate exposure our balance sheet contains interest bearing assets which have fixed rates of interest 
these assets include license installments receivable generated in the normal course of business through transactions with customers and our investments in marketable debt securities 
license installments receivable bear interest at the rate in effect when the license revenue was recognized  which does not vary throughout the life of the contractual cash flow stream 
we believe that at current market interest rates  the fair value of license installments receivable approximates the carrying value as reported on our balance sheets 
however  there can be no assurance that the fair market value will approximate the carrying value in the future 
factors such as increasing interest rates can reduce the fair market value of the license installments receivable 
changes in market rates do not affect net earnings as the license installments receivable are carried at cost and  since they are not financial instruments and are held until maturity  are not marked to market to reflect changes in the fair value of the portfolio 
the carrying value of our total license installment receivables was million as of december   and reflects the weighted average of historic discount rates used to record each term license arrangement 
the average rate changes with market rates as new license installments receivable are added to the portfolio  which mitigates exposure to market interest rate risk 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our license installments receivable by approximately million as of december  we invest primarily in government sponsored enterprises and corporate bonds that are fixed rate marketable debt securities 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would have reduced the fair value of our marketable debt securities by approximately million as of december  changes in market rates and 
table of contents the related impact on fair value of the investments do not generally affect net earnings as our investments are fixed rate securities and are classified as available for sale and as such  unrealized gains and losses  net of tax effect  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
however  when the investments are sold  the unrealized gains and losses are recorded as realized gains and losses and included in net income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
we analyze our investments for impairments on an ongoing basis 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the securities have been in an unrealized loss position and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated market recovery 
as of december   we held investments that had aggregate gross unrealized losses of approximately million 
all such securities have been in an unrealized loss position for less than months  except for approximately million of corporate bonds that had an unrealized loss of  and mature in we believe that the impairments to these investments are not other than temporary at this time as these securities are all highly rated investments which have been subject to routine market changes that have not been significant to date and we have the ability and intent to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated market recovery 
as of december   we did not directly hold any auction rate securities or mortgage backed securities 
as a result  any investment exposure related to the recent sub prime mortgage crisis is indirect and limited to our investments in corporate bonds of financial institutions that could be impacted by the sub prime mortgage crisis 
as of the date of this filing  we are not aware of any downgrades  losses  or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or short term investments
