overview we are a leading provider of data and information management software applications and related services 
we develop  market and sell a unified suite of data management software applications under the simpana brand 
our software was formerly marketed under the qinetix brand name 
our simpana software is designed to work together seamlessly from the ground up  sharing a single code and common function set  to deliver data protection  archive  replication  search and resource management capabilities 
with a single platform approach  simpana is specifically designed to protect and manage data throughout its lifecycle in less time  at lower cost and with fewer resources than alternative solutions 
our products and capabilities enable our customers to deploy solutions for data protection  business continuance  corporate compliance and centralized management and reporting 
we also provide our customers with a broad range of highly effective services that are delivered by our worldwide support and field operations 
as of march   we had licensed our software applications to approximately  registered customers 
history and background we began operations in as a development group within bell labs and were later designated as an at t network systems strategic business unit 
we were formed to develop automated backup  archiving and recovery products for at t s internal use 
these products were comprised of internally developed software integrated with third party hardware 
our business became a part of lucent technologies  which was created by and later spun off from at t 
donaldson  lufkin jenrette merchant banking and the sprout group funded and completed a management buyout of our company from lucent in may after the buyout  we continued to sell our software products integrated with third party hardware  primarily unix servers and optical and magnetic tape libraries 
these combined hardware and software products were marketed as abars  or automated backup and recovery solution  through  at which time we renamed the products vault 
table of contents in april  our board of directors and a new management team changed our strategic direction 
we believed that the data management software industry would shift from local  server attached environments to more complex and widely distributed data networks 
we believed that a broad suite of data management software applications built upon an innovative architecture and a single underlying code base would more easily and cost effectively manage data in this complex networked environment 
we also believed that our competitors would address this opportunity by adapting their legacy platforms and by developing or acquiring new applications built upon dissimilar underlying software architectures 
we believed  and continue to believe  that managing data with this type of loosely integrated solution would be more difficult and costly for the customer 
we also recognized that our legacy vault technology was too limited to address the broader data management market opportunity 
this vision resulted in an almost two year development project that culminated in the introduction of our galaxy data protection software in february galaxy represented the first of our software applications built upon our new architectural platform  and we now market it as one of the software products in our commvault simpana software suite 
the introduction of galaxy also marked the beginning of the phasing out of both our vault products and the sale of third party hardware 
we substantially completed the phase out of our sales of vault products and third party hardware in september our simpana software suite is comprised of the following five distinct data and information management software application modules data protection galaxy back up recovery  archive  replication  resource management and search 
all of our software application modules share our common technology engine 
in addition to galaxy back up recovery  the subsequent release of our other software has substantially increased our addressable market 
each application module can be used individually or in combination with other application modules from our single platform suite 
in july  we released our commvault simpana software suite  which significantly expanded the breadth and depth of our existing data management suite 
we believe that commvault simpana  which builds on and significantly expands our previous qinetix platform  will create competitive differentiation in the data management related markets as well as provide us a foundation to shift to providing information management solutions 
commvault simpana is the largest release in our history and contains major enhancements to our software suite of products 
specifically  commvault simpana provides major enhancements to our existing backup  archiving and replication products and also delivers new product features that are non backup related including single instancing  advanced archiving  enterprise wide search and discovery and data classification 
we currently derive the majority of our software revenue from our galaxy backup and recovery software application 
sales of galaxy backup and recovery represented approximately of our total software revenue for fiscal  and of our total software revenue for fiscal in addition  we derive the majority of our services revenue from customer and technical support associated with our galaxy backup and recovery software application 
the increase in software revenue generated by our non galaxy backup and recovery software products  or emerging products  was primarily driven by new components and enhancements related to our commvault simpana software suite 
we anticipate that emerging products software revenue as an overall percentage of our total software revenue will increase in the future as we expand our domestic and international sales activities and continue to build brand awareness 
however  we anticipate that we will continue to derive a majority of our software and services revenue from our galaxy backup and recovery software application for the foreseeable future 
given the nature of the industry in which we operate  our software applications are subject to obsolescence 
we continually develop and introduce updates to our existing software applications in order to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards  changing customer requirements and competitive software applications that may render our existing software applications obsolete 
for each of our software applications  we provide full support for the current generally available release and one prior release 
when we declare a product release obsolete  a customer notice is delivered twelve months prior to the effective date of obsolescence announcing continuation of full product support for the first six months 
we provide an additional six months of extended assistance support in which we only provide existing workarounds or fixes that do not require additional development activity 
we do not have existing plans to make any of our software products permanently obsolete 
we completed our initial public offering in september in which we sold  shares and certain of our stockholders sold  shares of common stock to the public at a price of per share 
after deducting 
table of contents the underwriting discounts and commissions and the other offering expenses  our net proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million 
in conjunction with the initial public offering  we also sold  shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement at the initial public offering price pursuant to preemptive rights that arose as a result of the initial public offering 
our net proceeds from the concurrent private placement were approximately million 
we used the net proceeds of the offering and the private placement  together with borrowings under our term loan and million of our existing cash and cash equivalents  to pay million in satisfaction of amounts due on our series a  b  c  d and e preferred stock upon its conversions into common stock  which occurred upon the closing of the offering 
in conjunction with the offering  all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into  shares of our common stock 
we completed our follow on public offering in june in which we sold  shares and certain of our stockholders sold  shares of common stock to the public at a price of per share 
after deducting the underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs  our net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
during the fiscal year ended march   we used the net proceeds from our follow on public offering  together with approximately million of our existing cash  to pay approximately million in satisfaction of the outstanding principal on our term loan 
sources of revenues we derive the majority of our total revenues from sales of licenses of our software applications 
we do not customize our software for a specific end user customer 
we sell our software applications to end user customers both directly through our sales force and indirectly through our global network of value added reseller partners  systems integrators  corporate resellers and original equipment manufacturers 
our corporate resellers bundle or sell our software applications together with their own products  and our value added resellers sell our software applications independently 
our software revenue was of our total revenues for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal software revenue generated through indirect distribution channels was approximately of total software revenue in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal software revenue generated through direct distribution channels was approximately of total software revenue in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the shift in software revenue generated through indirect distribution channels compared to our direct sales force is the result of both an increase in software revenue from our international operations which is almost exclusively transacted through indirect distribution and a shift to indirect distribution channels from direct distribution in software revenue generated in the united states 
in addition  deals initiated by our direct sales force in the united states are sometimes transacted through indirect channels based on end user customer requirements  which are not always in our control 
as such  there may be fluctuations in the dollars and percentage of software revenue generated through our direct distribution channels from time to time 
we believe that the growth of our software revenue  derived from both our indirect channel partners and direct sales force  are key attributes to our long term growth strategy 
we will continue to invest in both our channel relationships and direct sales force in the future  but would expect more revenue to be generated through indirect distribution over the long term 
the failure of our indirect distribution channels or our direct sales force to effectively sell our software applications could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
we have original equipment manufacturer agreements with dell and hitachi data systems for them to market  sell and support our software applications and services on a stand alone basis and or incorporate our software applications into their own hardware products 
dell and hitachi data systems have no obligation to recommend or offer our software applications exclusively or at all  and they have no minimum sales requirements and can terminate our relationship at any time 
an increasing amount of our software revenue is related to such sales arrangements with original equipment manufacturers that have no obligation to sell our software applications 
a material portion of our software revenue is generated through these arrangements  and we expect this contribution to grow in the future 
sales through our original equipment manufacturer agreements accounted for of our total revenues for fiscal  of our total revenues for fiscal and of our total revenues in fiscal in february  we signed a wide ranging distribution agreement with alternative technologies  inc ati  a subsidiary of arrow electronics  inc  covering our north american commercial markets 
in july  
table of contents we amended our agreement with ati to include our us federal government market 
pursuant to the distribution agreement  ati s primary role is to enable a more efficient and effective distribution channel for our products and services by managing our reseller partners and leveraging their own industry experience 
many of our north american resellers have been transitioned to ati throughout fiscal and fiscal we generated approximately of our total revenue through ati in fiscal if ati were to discontinue or reduce the sales of our products or if our agreement with ati was terminated  and if we were unable to take back the management of our reseller channel or find another north american distributor to replace ati  then it could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues 
in may  we signed an original equipment manufacturer agreement with bull sas bull pursuant to which they have agreed to market  sell  and support our software applications and services 
to date  we have not generated any material revenue through bull 
in december  we entered into a collaborative reseller agreement with sun pursuant to which they have agreed to promote  market  resell and distribute certain of our products 
our agreement with sun is a world wide agreement 
to date  we have not generated any revenue through sun 
in recent fiscal years  we have generated approximately two thirds of our software revenue from our existing customer base and approximately one third of our software revenue from new customers 
in addition  our total software revenue in any particular period is  to a certain extent  dependent upon our ability to generate revenues from large customer software deals 
we expect the number of software transactions over million to increase throughout fiscal  although the size and timing of any particular software transaction is more difficult to forecast 
such software transactions typically represent approximately to of our total software revenue in any given period 
our services revenue is made up of fees from the delivery of customer support and other professional services  which are typically sold in connection with the sale of our software applications 
customer support agreements provide technical support and unspecified software updates on a when and if available basis for an annual fee based on licenses purchased and the level of service subscribed 
other professional services include consulting  assessment and design services  implementation and post deployment services and training  all of which to date have predominantly been sold in connection with the sale of software applications 
our services revenue was of our total revenues for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the gross margin of our services revenue was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in the gross margin of our services revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a higher percentage of our services revenue being derived from customer support agreements as a result of sales to new customers and renewal agreements with our installed customer base 
overall  our services revenue has lower gross margins than our software revenue 
the gross margin of our software revenue was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal an increase in the percentage of total revenues represented by services revenue would adversely affect our overall gross margins 
description of costs and expenses our cost of revenues is as follows cost of software revenue  consists primarily of third party royalties and other costs such as media  manuals  translation and distribution costs  and cost of services revenue  consists primarily of salary and employee benefit costs in providing customer support and other professional services 
our operating expenses are as follows sales and marketing  consists primarily of salaries  commissions  employee benefits  stock based compensation and other direct and indirect business expenses  including travel and related expenses  sales promotion expenses  public relations expenses and costs for marketing materials and other marketing events such as trade shows and advertising  
table of contents research and development  which is primarily the expense of developing new software applications and modifying existing software applications  consists principally of salaries  stock based compensation and benefits for research and development personnel and related expenses  contract labor expense and consulting fees as well as other expenses associated with the design  certification and testing of our software applications  and legal costs associated with the patent registration of such software applications  general and administrative  consists primarily of salaries  stock based compensation and benefits for our executive  accounting  human resources  legal  information systems and other administrative personnel 
also included in this category are other general corporate expenses  such as outside legal and accounting services and insurance  and depreciation and amortization  consists of depreciation expense primarily for computer equipment we use for information services and in our development and test labs 
we anticipate that each of the above categories of operating expenses will increase in dollar amounts  but will decline as a percentage of total revenues in the long term 
critical accounting policies in presenting our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported therein 
some of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
the following is a description of our accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments  which could potentially have a material effect on our reported financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  and related interpretations 
our revenue recognition policy is based on complex rules that require us to make significant judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy  we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently generally software revenue and which portions must be deferred and recognized in future periods generally services revenue 
we analyze various factors including  but not limited to  the sales of undelivered services when sold on a stand alone basis  our pricing policies  the credit worthiness of our customers and resellers  accounts receivable aging data and contractual terms and conditions in helping us to make such judgments about revenue recognition 
changes in judgment on any of these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
currently  we derive revenues from two primary sources  or elements software licenses and services 
services include customer support  consulting  assessment and design services  installation services and training 
a typical sales arrangement includes both of these elements 
for sales arrangements involving multiple elements  we recognize revenue using the residual method as described in sop under the residual method  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on relative fair value and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements as revenue 
the determination of fair value of the undelivered elements in multiple element arrangements is based on the price charged when such elements are sold separately  which is commonly referred to as vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
software licenses typically provide for the perpetual right to use our software and are sold on a per copy basis or as site licenses 
site licenses give the customer the additional right to deploy the software on a limited basis during a specified term 
we recognize software revenue through direct sales channels upon receipt of a purchase order or other persuasive evidence and when the other three basic revenue recognition criteria are met as described in the revenue recognition section in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we recognize software revenue through all indirect sales channels on a sell through model 
a sell through model requires that we 
table of contents recognize revenue when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met and these channels complete the sale of our software products to the end user 
revenue from software licenses sold through an original equipment manufacturer partner is recognized upon the receipt of a royalty report or purchase order from that original equipment manufacturer partner 
services revenue includes revenue from customer support and other professional services 
customer support includes software updates on a when and if available basis  telephone support and bug fixes or patches 
customer support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer support agreement  which is typically one year 
to determine the price for the customer support element when sold separately  we primarily use historical renewal rates and  in certain cases  we use stated renewal rates 
historical renewal rates are supported by a rolling month vsoe analysis in which we segregate our customer support renewal contracts into different classes based on specific criteria including  but not limited to  dollar amount of software purchased  level of customer support being provided and distribution channel 
the purpose of such an analysis is to determine if the customer support element that is deferred at the time of a software sale is consistent with how it is sold on a stand alone renewal basis 
our other professional services include consulting  assessment and design services  installation services and training 
other professional services provided by us are not mandatory and can also be performed by the customer or a third party 
in addition to a signed purchase order  our consulting  assessment and design services and installation services are generally evidenced by a statement of work  which defines the specific scope of the services to be performed when sold and performed on a stand alone basis or included in multiple element sales arrangements 
revenues from consulting  assessment and design services and installation services are based upon a daily or weekly rate and are recognized when the services are completed 
training includes courses taught by our instructors or third party contractors either at one of our facilities or at the customer s site 
training fees are recognized after the training course has been provided 
based on our analysis of such other professional services transactions sold on a stand alone basis  we have concluded we have established vsoe for such other professional services when sold in connection with a multiple element sales arrangement 
in summary  we have analyzed all of the undelivered elements included in our multiple element sales arrangements and determined that we have vsoe of fair value to allocate revenues to services 
our analysis of the undelivered elements has provided us with results that are consistent with the estimates and assumptions used to determine the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our multiple element sales arrangements 
accordingly  assuming all basic revenue recognition criteria are met  software revenue is recognized upon delivery of the software license using the residual method in accordance with sop we are not likely to materially change our pricing and discounting practices in the future 
our sales arrangements generally do not include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement does include an acceptance clause  we defer the revenue for such an arrangement and recognize it upon acceptance 
acceptance occurs upon the earliest of receipt of a written customer acceptance  waiver of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we have offered limited price protection under certain original equipment manufacturer agreements 
we believe that the likelihood of a future payout due to price protection is remote 
stock based compensation as of march   we maintain two stock based compensation plans  which are described more fully in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
prior to april   we accounted for our stock option plan under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by fasb statement no 
 sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
stock based employee compensation cost was recognized in the statement of operations for the year ended march  to the extent stock options granted had an exercise price that was less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
in note of our consolidated financial statements  we have presented the pro forma effect on net income loss attributable to common stockholders as if we had applied the fair value recognition of sfas 
table of contents on april   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas statement no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  our stock based compensation costs beginning april  is based on a combination of the following all options granted prior to  but not vested as of april   based on the grant date fair value in accordance with the original provisions of sfas and all options and restricted stock units granted subsequent to april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas r 
we anticipate that future grants under our stock based compensation plans will include both non qualified stock options and restricted stock units 
under sfas r  we estimated the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes formula 
the fair value of restricted stock units awarded is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation for all share based payment awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
forfeitures are estimated based on a historical analysis of our actual stock option forfeitures 
expected volatility was calculated based on reported data for a peer group of publicly traded companies for which historical information was available 
we will continue to use peer group volatility information until our historical volatility is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
the risk free interest rate is determined by reference to us treasury yield curve rates with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
the average expected life was determined according to the simplified method as described in sab  disclosure about fair value of financial instruments  which is the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab extends the use of the simplified method for plain vanilla awards in certain situations 
we currently use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for share option grants as we do not have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate due to the limited period our equity shares have been publicly traded 
we will continue to use the simplified method until we have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate of expected term in accordance with sab the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model in the fiscal year ended march  and are as follows year ended march  dividend yield none none expected volatility weighted average expected volatility risk free interest rates expected life in years the weighted average fair value of stock options granted was during the year ended march   and during the year ended march  in addition  the weighted average fair value of restricted stock units awarded was per share during the year ended march  as of march   there was approximately million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non vested stock option and restricted stock unit awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the intrinsic value of the options outstanding as of march   was million  of which million related to vested options and million related to unvested options 
all stock options granted subsequent to the completion of our initial public offering on september  were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock based on the publically traded price as reported by the nasdaq stock market 
in establishing estimates of fair value of our common stock from january  through may   we performed a retrospective determination of fair value of our common stock utilizing the probability weighted expected returns pwer method described in the aicpa technical practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  which is more fully described in our prospectus dated september  we estimated the fair value of our common stock from june  through september  based on a contemporaneous valuation using the pwer method for stock options granted on july  and based on the midpoint of the estimated offering range contained in our prospectus for options granted on september  
table of contents accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision or benefit for taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of march   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million  which were primarily related to federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and federal and state research tax credit carryforwards 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
as of march   we do not maintain a valuation allowance against any of our deferred tax assets 
at march   we have federal and state net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal nol carryforwards expire from through  and the state nol carryforwards expire from to at march   we also have nol carryforwards for foreign tax purposes of approximately million which begin to expire in at march   we have federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research tax credit carryforwards expire from through  and the state research tax credit carryforwards expire through at march   we have federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million 
on april   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
as a result of the adoption of fin  we recognized a charge of million to the april  accumulated deficit balance 
as of march   we had unrecognized tax benefits of million all of which  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective tax rate 
in addition  we have accrued interest and penalties of million related to the unrecognized tax benefits 
interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense 
we do not anticipate any material changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits exclusive of interest within the next twelve months 
components of the reserve are classified as either current or long term in the consolidated balance sheet based on when we expect each of the items to be settled 
accordingly  we have recorded our unrecognized tax benefits of million and accrued interest and penalties of million totaling million  which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
we conduct business globally and as a result  file income tax returns in the united states and in various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world  including such major jurisdictions as the united states  australia  canada  germany  netherlands and united kingdom 
we are not currently under audit in any tax jurisdiction 
the following table summarizes the tax years in the major tax jurisdictions that remain subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities as of march  due to nol carryforwards  in some cases the tax years continue to remain subject to examination with respect to such nol s

sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
based on our software development process  technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model  which also 
table of contents requires certification and extensive testing 
costs incurred by us between completion of the working model and the point at which the product is ready for general release are immaterial 
results of operations the following table sets forth each of our sources of revenues and costs of revenues for the specified periods as a percentage of our total revenues for those periods due to rounding  numbers in column may not sum to totals year ended march  revenues software services total revenues cost of revenues software services total cost of revenues gross margin fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues total revenues increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal software revenue 
software revenue increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal software revenue represented of our total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal our overall growth in software revenue is derived from a higher volume of purchases of our software applications from both new customers as well as from our expanding base of existing customers 
in fiscal  the increase in software revenue is primarily driven by software revenue derived from foreign locations  which increased compared to fiscal the growth in software revenue in foreign locations is primarily due to increases in europe  canada  asia and australia as we expand our international operations 
software revenue derived from the united states increased in fiscal compared to fiscal software revenue through our resellers increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal and software revenue derived from our direct sales force decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in software revenue through our resellers and the related decrease in software revenue derived from our direct sales force is primarily due to the higher growth percentage of software generated in foreign locations  which is substantially sold through our channel partners as well as higher revenue through our reseller arrangement with dell in both the united states and europe 
the overall shift in software revenue generated through indirect distribution channels compared to our direct sales force is more fully discussed above in the sources of revenue section 
in addition  software revenue through our original equipment manufacturers contributed million to our overall increase in software revenue primarily due to higher revenue from our arrangements with hitachi data systems and dell 
software revenue derived from transactions greater than million represented approximately of our software revenue in fiscal and approximately of our software revenue in fiscal as a result  software revenue from transactions greater than million increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is primarily due to a increase in the number of transactions of this type 
in both fiscal and  the average dollar amount of such transactions was approximately million 
movements in foreign exchange rates accounted for approximately million  or  of the million increase in software revenue 

table of contents services revenue 
services revenue increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal services revenue represented of our total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in services revenue is primarily due to a million increase in revenue from customer support agreements as a result of software sales to new customers and renewal agreements with our installed software base 
movements in foreign exchange rates accounted for approximately million  or  of the million increase in services revenue 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal total cost of revenues represented of our total revenues in both fiscal and fiscal cost of software revenue 
cost of software revenue increased approximately million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cost of software revenue represented of our total software revenue in both fiscal and fiscal the increase in cost of software is primarily due to higher distribution and third party media costs related to our commvault simpana software suite 
cost of services revenue 
cost of services revenue increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cost of services revenue represented of our services revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in cost of services revenue is primarily the result of higher employee compensation and travel expenses totaling approximately million resulting from higher headcount and a million increase in third party outsourcing costs 
movements in foreign exchange rates accounted for approximately million  or  of the million increase in cost of services revenue 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to a million increase in employee compensation  which includes higher headcount costs as well as higher commissions on record revenues 
sales and marketing expenses also increased due to a million increase in travel and related expenses due to increased headcount  a million increase in advertising and marketing related expenses as we continue to build brand awareness and million in higher stock based compensation expense recorded in accordance with sfas r 
movements in foreign exchange rates accounted for approximately million  or  of the total million increase in sales and marketing expenses 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to million of higher employee compensation resulting from higher headcount and a million increase in stock based compensation recorded in accordance with sfas r 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to a million increase in employee compensation and related expenses resulting mainly from higher headcount  a million increase in compliance and insurance costs associated with being a public company  a million increase in stock based compensation expense recorded in accordance with sfas r and a million increase in foreign currency transaction losses 
movements in foreign exchange rates accounted for approximately million  or  of the total million increase in general and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this reflects higher depreciation associated with increased capital expenditures primarily for product development and other computer related equipment 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we repaid the outstanding balance on our term loan facility that we entered into in fiscal 
table of contents interest income interest income increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to higher cash balances in our deposit accounts 
income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit was an expense of million in fiscal compared to a benefit of million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was approximately 
the effective tax rate in fiscal differs from the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to foreign and research tax credits totaling million and a million reversal of our deferred income tax valuation allowance 
until the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance in certain international jurisdictions primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards based on our assessment that the realization of the net deferred tax assets did not meet the more than likely not criterion under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
during the quarter ended december   we modified our transfer pricing policies for software sold to certain of our international subsidiaries 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in such international jurisdictions  we considered projected future income as part of its analysis 
due to the transfer pricing changes made during the third quarter  we project that certain of our international subsidiaries will be in a profitable position for the foreseeable future 
therefore  we no longer believe that a valuation allowance is necessary against the deferred tax assets in these international operations and recorded a tax benefit of million related to the reversal of such valuation allowances 
the income tax benefit in fiscal primarily reflects a million reversal of our deferred income tax valuation allowance mainly related to our us jurisdictions  partially offset by the recognition of approximately million for certain tax reserves 
until the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had recorded a valuation allowance to fully reserve all our net deferred tax assets 
as of march   we determined that based upon a number of factors  including our cumulative taxable income over the past three fiscal years and expected profitability in future years  that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable through future earnings 
accordingly  as of march   we reversed substantially all of our deferred income tax valuation allowance and recorded a corresponding tax benefit of million 
in addition  based on our evaluation of current tax positions during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a tax charge of million to appropriately accrue for probable exposures associated with various filing positions 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues total revenues increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal software revenue

income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit was an expense of million in fiscal compared to a benefit of million in fiscal the income tax expense in fiscal is primarily due to alternative minimum taxes due to the us federal government as well as various state income taxes 
the income tax benefit in fiscal primarily reflects a million reversal of our deferred income tax valuation allowance mainly related to us jurisdictions  partially offset by the recognition of approximately million for certain tax reserves 
until the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had recorded a valuation allowance to fully reserve our net deferred tax assets based on our assessment that the realization of the net deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not criterion under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as of march   we determined that based upon a number of factors  including our cumulative taxable income over the past three fiscal years and expected profitability in future years  that certain of our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable through future earnings 
accordingly  as of march  we reversed substantially all of our deferred income tax valuation allowance and recorded a corresponding tax benefit of million 
in addition  based on our evaluation of current tax positions during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a tax charge of million to appropriately accrue for probable exposures associated with various filing positions 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   our cash and cash equivalents balance of million primarily consisted of money market funds 
in recent fiscal years  our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations and cash provided from our public offerings of common stock 
historically  our principle source of liquidity had been cash provided by private placements of preferred equity securities and common stock 
in january  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to million of our common stock over the following months 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased  shares with a total cost of approximately million  or an average price of per share 
under our share repurchase program  repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to unissued status 
as of march   approximately million remained under our share repurchase authorization 
in june  we completed our follow on public offering in june in which we sold  shares and certain of our stockholders sold  shares of common stock to the public at a price of per share 
after deducting the underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs  our net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
during fiscal  we used the net proceeds from our follow on public offering  together with approximately million of our existing cash  to pay approximately million in satisfaction of the outstanding principal on our term loan 
in september  we completed our initial public offering and related concurrent private placement and generated net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds  together with net borrowings of million under a term loan and million of our existing cash and cash equivalents  to pay million in satisfaction of amounts due on our series a  b  c  d and e preferred stock upon its conversions into common stock

we anticipate that as our revenues continue to grow  accounts receivable and deferred services revenue balances should continue to grow as well 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income adjusted for the impact of noncash charges and an increase in deferred services revenue

the increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to net income generated during the period adjusted for the impact of non cash charges and the increase in deferred revenue  partially offset by the net cash used in connection with the transactions associated with our initial public offering 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we cannot assure you that this will be the case or that our assumptions regarding revenues and expenses underlying this belief will be accurate 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements during this period 
adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  dilution to existing stockholders will result 
if we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties  the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operational flexibility  and would also require us to fund additional interest expense 
if funding is insufficient at any time in the future  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products or services  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments our material capital commitments consist of obligations under facilities and operating leases 
some of these leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions 
we recognize rent expense under leases on a straight line basis 
we anticipate that we will experience an increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments 
table of contents consistent with our anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel and additional resources devoted to building our brand name and marketing and sales force 
we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments 
the following table summarizes our existing long term contractual obligations as of march  dollars in thousands payments due by period more less than than total year years years years operating lease obligations the contractual obligations table above excludes our fin liabilities of totaling million because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
the million is classified as a long term liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of march  as none of these obligations are anticipated to be paid within one year from april  we offer a day limited product warranty for our software 
to date  costs relating to this product warranty have not been material 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march  and  we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
indemnifications certain of our software licensing agreements contain certain provisions that indemnify our customers from any claim  suit or proceeding arising from alleged or actual intellectual property infringement 
these provisions continue in perpetuity along with our software licensing agreements 
we have never incurred a liability relating to one of these indemnification provisions in the past and we believe that the likelihood of any future payout relating to these provisions is remote 
therefore  we have not recorded a liability during any period related to these indemnification provisions 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement  fair value measurement statement 
statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a hierarchy that categorizes and prioritizes the sources to be used to estimate fair value 
statement also expands financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements 
on february   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp which delays the effective date of statement for one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
statement and fsp are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we have elected a partial deferral of statement under the provisions of fsp the impact of adopting certain provisions of statement effective january  is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of sfas statement  which permits but does not require us to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of march   our cash and cash equivalents balance consisted primarily of money market funds 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we are not subject to any material interest rate risk on these balances 
foreign currency risk as a global company  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international sales are generally denominated in foreign currencies  and this revenue could be materially affected by currency fluctuations 
approximately of our sales were outside the united states in fiscal and were outside the united states in fiscal our primary exposures are to fluctuations in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the euro  and to a lesser extent  the australian dollar  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  chinese yuan  indian rupee and singapore dollar 
changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and require us to reduce our prices to remain competitive in foreign markets  which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
historically  we have periodically reviewed and revised the pricing of our products available to our customers in foreign countries and we have not maintained excess cash balances in foreign accounts 
to date  we have not hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and as a result  could incur unanticipated gains or losses 
we estimate that a change in all foreign exchange rates would impact our reported operating profit by approximately million annually 
this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area
