item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this report and our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain forward looking statements  which generally include the plans and objectives of management for future operations  including plans and objectives relating to our future economic performance and our current beliefs regarding revenues we might generate and profits we might earn if we are successful in implementing our business and growth strategies 
the forward looking statements and associated risks may include  relate to or be qualified by other important factors  including  without limitation fluctuations in the market price of ethanol and its co products  the projected growth or contraction in the ethanol and co product market in which we operate  our strategies for expanding  maintaining or contracting our presence in these markets  our ability to successfully develop  finance  construct and operate our planned ethanol production facilities  anticipated trends in our financial condition and results of operations  and our ability to distinguish ourselves from our current and future competitors 
we do not undertake to update  revise or correct any forward looking statements  except as required by law 
any of the factors described immediately above or in the risk factors section above could cause our financial results  including our net income or loss or growth in net income or loss to differ materially from prior results  which in turn could  among other things  cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
overview our primary goal is to be the leading marketer and producer of low carbon renewable fuels in the western united states 
we produce and sell ethanol and its co products and provide transportation  storage and delivery of ethanol through third party service providers in the western united states  primarily in california  nevada  arizona  oregon  colorado and idaho 
we have extensive customer relationships throughout the western united states and extensive supplier relationships throughout the western and midwestern united states 
we own and operate two ethanol production facilities located in madera  california and boardman  oregon 
our madera facility has an annual production capacity of up to million gallons and has been in operation since october our boardman facility has an annual production capacity of up to million gallons and has been in operation since september in addition  we own a interest in front range energy  llc  or front range  which owns and operates an ethanol production facility with annual production capacity of up to million gallons in windsor  colorado 
we have two additional ethanol production facilities under construction  in burley  idaho and stockton  california  which are expected to commence operations in the second and third quarters of  respectively 
we also intend to either construct or acquire additional ethanol production facilities as financial resources and business prospects make the construction or acquisition of these facilities advisable 
see business production facilities 
total annual gasoline consumption in the united states is approximately billion gallons 
total annual ethanol consumption represented less than of this amount in we believe that the domestic ethanol industry has substantial potential for growth to initially reach what we estimate is an achievable level of at least of the total annual gasoline consumption in the united states  or approximately billion gallons of ethanol annually and thereafter up to billion gallons of ethanol annually under the new national renewable fuel standards  or rfs  by see business governmental regulation 
we intend to reach our goal to be the leading marketer and producer of low carbon renewable fuels in the western united states in part by expanding our relationships with customers and third party ethanol producers to market higher volumes of ethanol  by expanding our relationships with animal feed distributors and end users to build local markets for wet distillers grains  or wdg  the primary co product of our ethanol production  and by expanding the market for ethanol by continuing to work with state governments to encourage the adoption of policies and standards that promote ethanol as a fuel additive and transportation fuel 
in addition  we intend to expand our annual production capacity to million gallons in  upon completion of our facilities in burley  idaho and stockton  california  and million gallons of annual production capacity in  through new construction or acquisition of additional ethanol production facilities 
we also intend to expand our distribution infrastructure by increasing our ability to provide transportation  storage and related logistical services to our customers throughout the western united states 
financial performance summary our net sales increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our net loss  however  increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  factors that contributed to our results of operations for include net sales 
the increase in our net sales in as compared to was primarily due to the following combination of factors o higher sales volumes 
total volume of ethanol sold increased by to million gallons in from million gallons in the increase in sales volume is primarily due to a full year of ethanol production from our madera and front range facilities  each of which accounted for less than three months of production in sales also increased in from startup of production at our boardman facility and additional supply purchased from third party suppliers under our ethanol marketing agreements  and o lower ethanol prices 
the increase in sales volume was partially offset by lower ethanol prices 
our average sales price of ethanol decreased to per gallon in as compared to per gallon in this decrease is  however  less than the decline in the average chicago board of trade  or cbot  ethanol price to per gallon in as compared to per gallon in lower gross profit margin 
our gross profit margin decreased to for as compared to for this decrease was primarily due to lower ethanol prices and higher corn prices 
in addition  we had significant fixed price contracts and held inventory balances during a period of declining ethanol prices  both of which reduced our margins 
the average price of corn  the main raw material for ethanol we produce  increased by to per bushel for from per bushel for the average cbot price for corn increased by to per bushel for from per bushel for also  gross profit margins from our sale of wdg and other co products from our ethanol production declined due to the increase in corn prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in primarily as a result of increases in administrative staff  amortization of intangible assets and full year expenses related to our ownership interest in front range 
however  these expenses decreased to of our net sales in as compared to of our net sales in due to the substantial growth in our net sales over those periods 
other income expense 
our other expense increased by million to million in from other income of million in this increase is primarily due to an increase in interest expense and amortization of finance charges from our increase in debt 
in addition  other expense increased due to mark to market charges in the amount of million on future interest rate positions 
sales and margins over the past three years  our sales mix has shifted significantly from sales generated solely as a marketer of ethanol produced by third parties to now include sales generated as a producer of our own ethanol 
our cost structure also changed significantly  predominantly in  as our madera and front range facilities were in full production and our boardman facility was in production for more than three months during the year 
the shift in our sales mix greatly altered our dependency on certain market conditions from that based primarily on the market price of ethanol to now include the cost of corn  the principal input commodity for our production of ethanol 
accordingly  our profitability is now highly dependent on the market price of ethanol and the cost of corn 
average ethanol sales prices dropped significantly in as compared to specifically  the average cbot price of ethanol decreased by in as compared to the average price 
the decrease in the prevailing market price of ethanol was the primary cause of the decline in our average ethanol sales price 
however  because of our combination of fixed and index priced ethanol sales contracts  we were able to diminish the decline in our average ethanol sales price to only in as compared to our average price 
average corn prices increased significantly in as compared to specifically  the average cbot price of corn increased by in as compared to the average price 
the increase in the prevailing market price of corn was the primary cause of the increase in our average corn price 
however  our average corn price increased by in as compared to our average price a rate greater than the increase in the average cbot price of corn because we purchased more corn in the fourth quarter of  a period during which corn prices were at their highest levels during the year  as compared to previous quarters in connection with the commencement of operations at our boardman facility 
we have three principal methods of selling ethanol as a merchant  as a producer and as an agent 
see critical accounting policies revenue recognition below 
when acting as a merchant or as a producer  we generally enter into sales contracts to ship ethanol to a customer s desired location 
we support these sales contracts through purchase contracts with several third party suppliers or through our own production 
we manage the necessary logistics to deliver ethanol to our customers either directly from a third party supplier or from our inventory via truck or rail 
our sales as a merchant or as a producer expose us to price risks resulting from potential fluctuations in the market price of ethanol 
our exposure varies depending on the magnitude of our sales commitments compared to the magnitude of our purchase commitments and existing inventory  as well as the pricing terms such as market index or fixed pricing of our contracts 
we seek to mitigate our exposure to price risks by implementing appropriate risk management strategies 
when acting as an agent for third party suppliers  we conduct back to back purchases and sales in which we match ethanol purchase and sale contracts of like quantities and delivery periods 
when acting as an agent for third party suppliers  we receive a predetermined service fee and we have little or no exposure to price risks resulting from potential fluctuations in the market price of ethanol 
we believe that our gross profit margins will primarily depend on four key factors the market price of ethanol  which we believe will be impacted by the degree of competition in the ethanol market  the price of gasoline and related petroleum products  and government regulation  including tax incentives  the market price of key production input commodities  including corn and natural gas  our ability to anticipate trends in the market price of ethanol  wdg  and key input commodities and implement appropriate risk management and opportunistic strategies  and the proportion of our sales of ethanol produced at our facilities to our sales of ethanol produced by third parties 
we believe that our gross profit margins will also depend on the market price of wdg 
management seeks to optimize our gross profit margins by anticipating the factors above and implementing hedging transactions and taking other actions designed to limit risk and address the various factors 
for example  we may seek to decrease inventory levels in anticipation of declining ethanol prices and increase inventory levels in anticipation of increasing ethanol prices 
we may also seek to alter our proportion or timing  or both  of purchase and sales commitments 
our inability to anticipate the factors above or their relative importance  and adverse movements in the factors themselves  could result in declining or even negative gross profit margins over certain periods of time 
our ability to anticipate those factors or favorable movements in the factors themselves may enable us to generate above average gross profit margins 
however  given the difficulty associated with successfully forecasting any of these factors  we are unable to estimate our future gross profit margins 
results of operations the following selected financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report 
certain performance metrics that we believe are important indicators of our results of operations include years ended december  percentage variance from prior year gallons sold in millions average sales price per gallon corn cost per bushel cbot equivalent n a n a co product revenues as of delivered cost of corn n a n a average cbot ethanol price per gallon average cbot corn price per bushel we exclude transportation or basis costs in our corn costs to calculate a cbot equivalent in order to more appropriately compare our corn costs to average cbot corn prices 
co product revenues as of delivered cost of corn shows our yield based on sales of wdg generated from ethanol we produced 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  years ended dollar variance percentage variance results as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december  favorable favorable december  unfavorable unfavorable dollars in thousands net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations other income expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes and noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity provision for income taxes noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity net loss preferred stock dividends deemed dividend on preferred stock loss available to common stockholders net sales the increase in our net sales in as compared to was primarily due to a substantial increase in sales volume  which was partially offset by decreased average sales prices 
total volume of ethanol sold increased by million gallons  or  to million gallons in as compared to million gallons in the substantial increase in sales volume is primarily due to a full year of ethanol production at our madera and front range facilities in our madera and front range facilities each accounted for less than three months of ethanol production in in addition  in  we commenced ethanol production at our boardman facility and also generated increased sales from the purchase and resale of additional supply from third parties under our ethanol marketing agreements 
the production and sale of ethanol and its co products from our madera and boardman facilities  and through front range  contributed an aggregate of million to our increase in net sales in our average sales price per gallon declined to in from an average sales price per gallon of in the average cbot price per gallon declined to in from an average cbot price per gallon of in we believe that we were insulated from some of this decline due to our fixed price ethanol contracts which were partially offset by derivative losses incurred as a result of locking in margins 
cost of goods sold and gross profit the increase in our cost of goods sold in as compared to was predominantly due to increased sales volume and increased corn costs which contributed to higher costs per gallon 
our gross margin declined to in from in primarily due to increased corn costs  lower average sales prices per gallon and losses on derivatives  as further discussed below 
although a large proportion of our sales volume results from the marketing and sale of ethanol produced by third parties  production of our own ethanol is growing rapidly and we expect that our production will continue to grow as new facilities commence operations 
our purchase and sale prices of ethanol produced by third parties typically fluctuate closely with market prices 
as a result  our average cost of ethanol purchased from third parties decreased in line with the overall decline in our average sales price per gallon 
corn is the single largest component of the cost of our ethanol production 
average corn prices rose significantly in as compared to  with greater increases occurring in the second half of than in the first half of the year 
these increases pushed our average corn price higher than the average market price for all of because our corn requirements increased significantly during the second half of due to the commencement of operations at our boardman facility in september overall  the price of corn had a much larger impact on our production costs per gallon in than in due to the higher proportion of sales from production of our own ethanol in as compared to cost of goods sold also increased by  from net losses on derivatives in as compared to only a nominal amount in these losses resulted from derivatives that we entered in order to lock in margins during the year and were partially offset by gains from derivatives we entered in order to lock in the price of corn 
of these losses   was related to open positions at december  selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  increased by  to  for as compared to  for sg a  however  decreased as a percentage of net sales due to our significant sales growth 
the increase in the dollar amount of sg a is primarily due to the following factors payroll and benefits increased by  or  due to increased administrative staff  amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of our ownership interest in front range increased by  as we incurred a full year of amortization compared to less than three months in  we expect these costs to decline to approximately  for each of the next seven years  sg a attributable to front range increased by  as we incurred a full year of these expenses as compared to less than three months in consulting and temporary staff expenses increased by  or  due to the retention of additional consulting and temporary staff personnel to assist us in meeting our accounting and public reporting requirements  including as we transitioned our permanent staff to our new corporate headquarters in sacramento  california  these consulting and temporary staff personnel also assisted us in training new administrative staff members  recruiting  hiring and training expenses increased by  or  employee travel and office setup costs increased by  or  and rent expense increased by  or  each of these increases resulted primarily from the relocation of our corporate headquarters in early from fresno to sacramento  external audit costs increased by  or  due to our overall growth and business initiatives  and travel related costs increased by  or  due to expanded operations and new office locations 
partially offsetting the foregoing increases were the following decreases non cash compensation expense decreased by  or  due to the completion of vesting of incentive compensation paid to employees and consultants  legal expenses decreased by  or  primarily due to one time costs associated with greater legal activity from litigation and business transactions that occurred in  and costs associated with implementing and testing our internal controls and related compliance required under the sarbanes oxley act of decreased by  or  as many costs that occurred in were related predominantly to our initial implementation and testing of our internal controls 
other income expense  net other expense increased by  to  in from other income of  in the increase in other expense is primarily due to the following factors interest expense increased by  or  due to additional borrowings and a full year of interest accruing on outstanding debt  and amortization of interest and financing costs increased by  or  primarily due to an amendment to our construction financing credit facility that reduced its application from five to four facilities and reduced the total amount of available financing  as a result  we wrote off  of unamortized costs associated with our imperial valley facility  the construction of which has been suspended  interest and financing costs incurred under the construction phase of each of our facilities are being capitalized until the corresponding facility becomes operational  this increase in amortization of interest and financing costs is net of approximately  of additional capitalized amounts over in addition  we recognized losses of  and  of effective and ineffectiveness positions  respectively  from our interest rate hedges which required that we mark to market our ineffective positions in a declining interest rate environment 
the ineffectiveness related to our interest rate swaps and primarily resulted from the suspension of construction of our imperial valley facility 
noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity relates to the consolidated treatment of front range  a variable interest entity  and represents the noncontrolling interest of others in the earnings of front range 
we consolidate the entire income statement of front range for the period covered 
however  because we own only of front range  we must reduce our net income or increase our net loss for the noncontrolling interest  which is the ownership interest that we do not own 
this amount increased by  to  in from  in due to the consolidation of front range s operations for all of as compared to less than three months in preferred stock dividends shares of our series a cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock  or series a preferred stock  are entitled to quarterly cumulative dividends payable in arrears in cash in an amount equal to per annum of the purchase price per share of the series a preferred stock  or  at our option  payable in additional shares of series a preferred stock based on the value of the purchase price per share of the series a preferred stock 
in  we declared and paid dividends on our series a preferred stock in the aggregate amount of  comprised of cash dividends in the aggregate amount of  for the first three quarters and a dividend payment in kind in the amount of  that was issued in shares of series a preferred stock for the fourth quarter 
deemed dividend on preferred stock we recorded a deemed dividend on preferred stock of  for in connection with our issuance of shares of series a preferred stock as a dividend payment in kind for the fourth quarter 
we also recorded a deemed dividend on preferred stock of  for in connection with our initial issuance of shares of series a preferred stock 
these non cash dividends reflect the implied economic value to the preferred stockholder of being able to convert these additional shares into common stock at prices which were in excess of the fair value of the series a preferred stock at the times of issuance 
the fair value was calculated using the difference between the agreed upon conversion price of the series a preferred stock into shares of common stock of per share and the fair market value of our common stock of and on the date of issuance of the additional shares of series a preferred stock for and  respectively 
the fair value allocated to the initial issuance of the series a preferred stock in was in excess of the gross proceeds received of  in connection with the initial sale of the series a preferred stock  however  the deemed dividend on the series a preferred stock for is limited to the gross proceeds received of  the deemed dividend on preferred stock is a reconciling item and adjusts our reported net loss  together with the preferred stock dividends discussed above  to loss available to common stockholders

during  total volume of ethanol sold increased by million gallons  or  to million gallons as compared to million gallons for for  our average sales price of ethanol increased by per gallon  or  to per gallon for as compared to per gallon for the substantial increase in sales volume is primarily due to additional supply provided under our ethanol marketing agreements and the commencement of ethanol production 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced producing ethanol and its co products at our madera facility and  based on our ownership interest in front range  began recording a proportionate amount of its net sales 
the production and sale of ethanol and its co products at our madera facility and through front range contributed an aggregate of  in sales for cost of goods sold and gross profit the increase in our cost of goods sold in as compared to was predominantly due to increased sales volume 
the increase in gross profit  both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  in as compared to is generally reflective of more advantageous buying and selling during a period of increasing market prices as well as the commencement of ethanol production at our madera facility and our acquisition of a interest in front range  both of which occurred in the fourth quarter of we established and maintained net long ethanol positions during much of the decision to maintain net long ethanol positions was reached in accordance with our risk management program and was based on a confluence of factors  including management s expectation of increased prices of gasoline and petroleum and the continued phase out of methyl tertiary butyl ether  or mtbe  blending which we believed would result in a significant increase in demand for blending ethanol with gasoline 
future gross profit margins will vary based upon  among other things  the size and timing of our net long or short positions during our various contract periods and the volatility of the market price of ethanol 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in sg a during as compared to was primarily due to a  increase in payroll and benefits related to the hiring of additional staff  a  increase in legal  accounting and consulting fees  a  increase in additional non cash director and consulting expenses  a  increase in depreciation and amortization  a  increase in insurance expense primarily related to increased directors and officers insurance costs  a  increase in general office and administrative expenses  a  increase in costs related to implementation and testing of internal controls and procedures in connection with the sarbanes oxley act of  a  increase in travel and entertainment and a  increase in investor relations expense 
other income expense  net other income increased during as compared to  primarily due to a  increase in interest income associated with the significant increase in our cash position due to the sale of shares of our common stock in may and shares of our series a preferred stock in april   in deferred financing cost amortization related to potential plant expansion financing and  in interest expense related to notes payable 
other changes included a  increase in capitalized interest related to a loan for the construction of our madera production facility  a  decrease in penalties and fines expenses and a  increase in all other categories 
noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity was  as noted above  this amount relates to the consolidated treatment of front range  a variable interest entity and represents the noncontrolling interest of others in the earnings of front range 
preferred stock dividends as noted above  shares of our series a preferred stock are entitled to quarterly cumulative dividends 
in  we declared and paid cash dividends on shares of our series a preferred stock in the aggregate amount of  deemed dividend on preferred stock we recorded a deemed dividend on preferred stock of  for in connection with our initial issuance of shares of series a preferred stock 
this non cash dividend reflects the implied economic value to the preferred stockholder of being able to convert the shares into common stock at a price which was in excess of the fair value of the series a preferred stock at the time of issuance 
the fair value was calculated using the difference between the agreed upon conversion price of the series a preferred stock into shares of common stock of per share and the fair market value of our common stock of on the date of issuance of the shares of series a preferred stock 
the fair value allocated to the issuance of the series a preferred stock was in excess of the gross proceeds received of  in connection with the sale of the series a preferred stock  however  the deemed dividend on the series a preferred stock for is limited to the gross proceeds received of  the deemed dividend on preferred stock is a reconciling item and adjusts our reported net loss  together with the preferred stock dividends discussed above  to loss available to common stockholders 
liquidity and capital resources overview during  we funded our operations primarily from our cash on hand  borrowings on our credit facilities and other loans 
in the first half of  we obtained financing for our first five ethanol production facilities and received the first draw under this credit facility in the amount of million for our madera facility 
we also received approximately million in the first half of  which represented the remaining balance in a restricted cash account from our april sale of our series a preferred stock 
these proceeds were used to fund the continued construction of four ethanol production facilities 
in the second half of  we received the second draw under our credit facility in the amount of million for our boardman facility 
in the second half of  we also settled certain cost overruns at our boardman facility through the issuance of a million note due in december also in the second half of  after evaluating the overall ethanol market and our production capacity and cost structure  we decided to suspend construction of our imperial valley facility near calipatria  california 
at the time of this decision  we owed approximately million for work already performed on the project 
we borrowed million in the fourth quarter of to help cover these and other costs 
see current and prospective capital needs and notes payable below 
sale of series b preferred stock on march   we issued to lyles united  llc   shares of our series b preferred stock and a ten year warrant to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million 
each share of series b preferred stock is initially convertible into three shares of our common stock 
we intend to use the proceeds from the sale of our series b preferred stock for general working capital purposes and to further fund the construction of our burley and stockton ethanol production facilities 
current and prospective capital needs we believe that current and future capital resources  revenues generated from operations and other existing sources of liquidity  including available proceeds from our existing debt financing  will be adequate to fund our operations through and meet our capital expenditure requirements to reach our goal of million gallons of annual production capacity in upon completion of our burley and stockton facilities 
we will require substantial additional financing to reach our goal of million gallons of annual production capacity in and we plan to reach this goal through new construction or acquisition of additional ethanol production facilities 
if ethanol production margins deteriorate from current levels  if we experience additional cost overruns at our ethanol production facilities under construction  if our capital requirements or cash flows otherwise vary materially and adversely from our current projections  or if other adverse unforeseen circumstances occur  our working capital may be inadequate to fully fund our operations or meet our capital expenditure requirements  or both 
we are presently exploring potential sources of new financing to provide additional working capital 
our failure to raise capital if or when needed may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and cash flows and may restrict our growth and hinder our ability to compete 
we have recently raised million in debt financing from lyles united  llc and million through the sale of our series b preferred stock and a warrant to lyles united  llc 
our need for this additional capital was due to numerous factors that arose or that we identified in the fourth quarter of we experienced higher than forecast construction costs at our burley and stockton facilities as a result of unanticipated change orders 
we also incurred higher costs related to the completion of punch list items at our boardman facility and costs related to the suspension of construction of our imperial valley facility 
in aggregate  these cost overruns that arose or that were identified in the fourth quarter of were approximately million 
in addition  funding under our construction loan facility will occur later than previously anticipated 
consequently  we expect to fund approximately million for the ongoing construction of our burley and stockton facilities 
we expect a significant portion of the million to be recovered upon completion of our burley and stockton facilities  at which time we expect to draw additional loan proceeds under the terms of our existing construction loan facility 
in addition to the above factors  we also continued to experience adverse ethanol market conditions during the fourth quarter of the effects of lower than expected commodity margins the difference between the selling price of ethanol and the cost of corn caused our cash generated from operations to be lower than forecast 
quantitative year end liquidity status we believe that the following amounts provide insight into our liquidity and capital resources 
the following selected financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report dollars in thousands as of and for the year ended december  december  variance current assets current liabilities property and equipment  net notes payable  net of current portion cash provided by used in operating activities working capital working capital ratio change in working capital and cash flows working capital decreased to a deficit of  at december  from working capital of  at december  as a result of a decrease in current assets of  and an increase in current liabilities of  current assets decreased primarily due to net decreases in cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of  and  respectively  the proceeds of which were predominantly used for costs associated with the construction of ethanol production facilities  and a decrease in accounts receivable of  which were partially offset by an increase in inventory of  primarily resulting from an increase in ethanol held in inventory  and an increase in all other current assets of  current liabilities increased primarily due to an increase in construction related accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  an increase in trade accounts payable of  an increase in current portion of long term notes payable of  a short term note payable of  an increase in contract retentions of  an increase in derivative liabilities of  an increase in accrued liabilities of  and an increase in all other liabilities of  which were partially offset by a net decrease in other liabilities related parties of the decrease in working capital was primarily due to construction activity during the year  requiring the use of our cash and investments in marketable securities balances and increased construction related accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the decrease in working capital was also due in part to increased short and long term financing  which increased the current portion of our debt 
cash provided by our operating activities of  resulted primarily from an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  depreciation and amortization of intangibles of  non controlling interest in our variable interest entity of  derivative losses of  amortization of deferred financing fees of  non cash compensation and consulting expense of  and a decrease in accounts receivable of  which were partially offset by an increase in inventories of  and other liabilities related parties of cash used in our investing activities of  resulted from purchases of additional property and equipment of  which were partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash designated for construction of  and proceeds from sales of marketable securities of  cash provided by our financing activities of  resulted primarily from proceeds from our debt financing and lines of credit of  and proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options of  which were partially offset by cash paid for debt issuance costs of  principal payments paid on borrowings of  and preferred stock dividends paid of changes in other assets and liabilities property and equipment  net  increased to  at december  from  at december  primarily as a result of the construction of ethanol plants 
restricted cash decreased to at december  from  at december  we received approximately  in the first half of  which represented the remaining balance in a restricted cash account from our april sale of our series a preferred stock 
notes payable  net of current portion  increased to  at december  from  at december  primarily as a result of loan proceeds used for construction activities at our ethanol plants under construction 
the proceeds from these notes payable were primarily from our debt financing arrangement described below 
debt financing on february   we closed a debt financing transaction in the aggregate amount of up to  through certain of our indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries 
the primary purpose of the debt financing was to provide debt financing for the development  construction  installation  engineering  procurement  design  testing  start up  operation and maintenance of five ethanol production facilities 
on november   we amended the related credit agreement to apply to four ethanol production facilities  thereby reducing the aggregate amount of available financing to up to  as of december   two of the four plants had been funded  with the remaining two expected to be funded in as of that date  the outstanding balance under the debt financing was  comprised of  in construction loans and  in used lines of credit 
debt financing proceeds are subject to customary conditions precedent  including  among others  the absence of a material adverse effect  the absence of defaults or events of defaults  which include the existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  the accuracy of certain representations and warranties  the maintenance of a debt to equity ratio that is not in excess of  the contribution of all required equity by us to the borrowers  which is expected to be approximately  in the aggregate  and the attainment of at least a to debt service coverage ratio 
also  the borrowers may not be able to fully utilize the debt financing if the completed ethanol plants fail to meet certain minimum performance standards or if the corresponding ethanol plants are not timely completed 
borrowings and the borrowers obligations under the debt financing are secured by a first priority security interest in all of our equity interests in the borrowers and substantially all the assets of the borrowers 
the security interests granted by the borrowers under the debt financing restrict the assets and revenues of the borrowers and therefore may inhibit our ability to obtain other debt financing 
in march  we became aware of various events or circumstances which constituted defaults under our credit agreement 
these events or circumstances included the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december   cash management activities that violated covenants in our credit agreement  failure to maintain adequate amounts in a designated debt service reserve account  the existence of a number of eurodollar loans in excess of the maximum number permitted under our credit agreement  and our failure to pay all remaining project costs on our madera and boardman facilities by certain stipulated deadlines 
on march   we obtained waivers from our lenders as to these defaults and were required to pay the lenders a consent fee in an aggregate amount of up to approximately  in addition to the waivers  our lenders agreed to amend the credit agreement 
these amendments include an increase in the frequency with which we are to deposit certain revenues into a restricted account each month  an increase the allowable eurodollar loans from a maximum of seven to a maximum of ten  and we are required to pay all remaining project costs on our madera and boardman facilities by may  line of credit in addition to the above debt financing  in august  we secured a working capital credit facility in the amount of up to  which expires in july as of december   we had  outstanding under this credit facility under two separate variable interest rates of and 
notes payable in november and december  one of our subsidiaries borrowed an aggregate of  in two separate loans of  each 
the loans accrue interest at a rate equal to the prime rate of interest as reported from time to time in the wall street journal  plus 
the november is due february  the december loan is due on march  or  if extended at our discretion  on march  we intend to extend the due date of the december loan 
both loans are secured by substantially all of our subsidiary s assets 
in addition  we have executed a corporate guaranty that guarantees the repayment of the loans 
contractual obligations the following table outlines payments due under our significant contractual obligations in thousands contractual obligations at december  thereafter total sourcing commitments debt principal debt interest operating leases firm capital commitments preferred dividends total commitments unconditional purchase commitments for production materials incurred in the normal course of business 
future minimum payments under non cancelable operating leases

the above table outlines our obligations as of december  and does not reflect the changes in our obligations that occurred after that date 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured in conformity with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of ethanol and related co products 
we recognize revenue when title transfers to our customers  which is generally upon the delivery of these products to a customer s designated location 
these deliveries are made in accordance with sales commitments and related sales orders entered into with customers either verbally or in written form 
the sales commitments and related sales orders provide quantities  pricing and conditions of sales 
in this regard  we engage in three basic types of revenue generating transactions as a producer 
sales as a producer consist of sales of our inventory produced at our facilities 
as a merchant 
sales as a merchant consist of sales to customers through purchases from third party suppliers in which we may or may not obtain physical control of the ethanol or co products  though ultimately titled to us  in which shipments are directed from our suppliers to our terminals or direct to our customers but for which we accept the risk of loss in the transactions 
as an agent 
sales as an agent consist of sales to customers through purchases from third party suppliers in which  depending upon the terms of the transactions  title to the product may technically pass to us  but the risk and rewards of inventory ownership remains with third party suppliers as we receive a predetermined service fee under these transactions and therefore act predominantly in an agency capacity 
when acting as an agent for third party suppliers  we conduct back to back purchases and sales in which we match ethanol purchase and sales contracts of like quantities and delivery periods 
we have employed the principles detailed in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  as guidance in our revenue recognition policies 
revenue from sales of third party ethanol and its co products is recorded net of costs when we are acting as an agent between the customer and supplier and gross when we are a principal to the transaction 
several factors are considered to determine whether we are acting as an agent or principal  most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the customer  whether we have inventory risk and related risk of loss or whether we add meaningful value to the vendor s product or service 
consideration is also given to whether we have latitude in establishing the sales price or have credit risk  or both 
we record revenues based upon the gross amounts billed to our customers in transactions where we act as a producer or a merchant and obtain title to ethanol and its co products and therefore own the product and any related  unmitigated inventory risk for the ethanol  regardless of whether we actually obtain physical control of the product 
when we act in an agency capacity  we record revenues on a net basis  or our predetermined agency fees only  based upon the amount of net revenues retained in excess of amounts paid to suppliers 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
we have determined that front range meets the definition of a variable interest entity under the financial accounting standards board s fasb financial interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
we have also determined that we are the primary beneficiary and we are therefore required to treat front range as a consolidated subsidiary for financial reporting purposes rather than use equity investment accounting treatment 
as a result  we have consolidated the financial results of front range  including its entire balance sheet with the balance of the noncontrolling interest displayed between liabilities and equity  and the income statement after intercompany eliminations with an adjustment for the noncontrolling interest in net income since our acquisition on october  under fin r  and as long as we are deemed the primary beneficiary of front range  we must treat front range as a consolidated subsidiary for financial reporting purposes 
impairment of intangible and long lived assets our intangible assets  including goodwill  were derived from the acquisition of our interest in front range in and our acquisition of kinergy in in connection with the share exchange transaction 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we allocated the respective purchase prices to the tangible assets  liabilities and intangible assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase prices over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded as goodwill 
our long lived assets are primarily associated with our ethanol production facilities 
we account for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with sfas no 
we review these assets at least annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in our review  we determine the fair value of these assets using market multiples and discounted cash flow modeling and compare it to the net book value of the acquired assets 
any assessed impairments will be recorded permanently and expensed in the period in which the impairment is determined 
if it is determined through our assessment process that any of our intangible assets require impairment charges  they will be recorded in the line item other operating charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
we performed our annual review of impairment and we have not recognized any impairment losses on any of our intangible assets through december  we evaluate impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that suggest the fair value of assets could be less then their net book value 
in such event  we assess long lived assets for impairment by determining their fair value based on the forecasted  undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate plus the net proceeds expected from the sale of the asset 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the related asset s net book value  and an impairment expense would be recorded in the amount of the difference 
forecasts of future cash flows are judgments based on our experience and knowledge of our operations and the industries in which we operate 
these forecasts could be significantly affected by future changes in market conditions  the economic environment  including inflation  and capital spending decisions of our customers 
we have not recognized any impairment losses on long lived assets through december  stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value method of accounting for employee stock compensation cost pursuant to sfas no 
r  share based payments 
prior to that date  we used the intrinsic value method under accounting policy board opinion no 
to recognize compensation cost 
under the method of accounting for the change to the fair value method  compensation cost recognized is the same amount that would have been recognized if the fair value method would have been used for all awards granted 
the effects on net income and income per share had the fair value method been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period are reflected in note of the consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions made for purposes of estimating the fair value of our stock options  as well as a summary of the activity under our stock option plan are included in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we account for the stock options granted to non employees in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and sfas no 
r 
derivative instruments and hedging activities our business and activities expose us to a variety of market risks  including risks related to changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
we monitor and manage these financial exposures as an integral part of our risk management program 
this program recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility could have on operating results 
we account for our use of derivatives related to our hedging activities pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in which we recognize all of our derivative instruments in our statement of financial position as either assets or liabilities  depending on the rights or obligations under the contracts 
we have designated and documented contracts for the physical delivery of commodity products to and from counterparties as normal purchases and normal sales 
derivative instruments are measured at fair value  pursuant to the definition found in sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s effective gains and losses to be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and later recorded together with the gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the statements of operations 
companies must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the estimated gains losses on our derivatives were as follows in thousands december  commodity futures commodity options interest rate options total allowance for doubtful accounts we primarily sell ethanol to gasoline refining and distribution companies 
we also sell wdg to dairy operators and animal feed distributors 
we had significant concentrations of credit risk as of december   as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  those customers historically have had good credit ratings and historically we have collected amounts that were billed to those customers 
receivables from customers are generally unsecured 
we continuously monitor our customer account balances and actively pursue collections on past due balances 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for balances that appear to have specific collection issues 
our collection process is based on the age of the invoice and requires attempted contacts with the customer at specified intervals 
if after a specified number of days  we have been unsuccessful in our collection efforts  we consider recording a bad debt allowance for the balance in question 
we would eventually write off accounts included in our allowance when we have determined that collection is not likely 
the factors considered in reaching this determination are the apparent financial condition of the customer  and our success in contacting and negotiating with the customer 
costs of start up activities start up activities are defined broadly in statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  as those one time activities related to opening a new facility  introducing a new product or service  conducting business in a new territory  conducting business with a new class of customer or beneficiary  initiating a new process in an existing facility  commencing some new operation or activities related to organizing a new entity 
our start up activities consist primarily of costs associated with new or potential sites for ethanol production facilities 
we expense all the costs associated with a potential site  until the site is considered viable by management  at which time costs would be considered for capitalization based on authoritative accounting literature 
these costs are included in selling  general  and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosure about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under statement no 
and its related interpretations and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
we are currently evaluating the impact sfas no 
may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas no 
r retains the fundamental requirements in sfas no 
that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
sfas no 
r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions specified in sfas no 
r 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires acquisition costs and restructuring costs that the acquirer expected but was not obligated to incur to be recognized separately from the business combination  therefore  expensed instead of part of the purchase price allocation 
sfas no 
r will be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is prohibited 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r to any business combinations with an acquisition date on or after january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment to arb no 
sfas no 
changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  early adoption is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the impact sfas no 
may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits an entity to irrevocably elect fair value on a contract by contract basis as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for many financial assets and liabilities and certain other items including insurance contracts 
entities electing the fair value option would be required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings and to expense upfront costs and fees associated with the item for which the fair value option is elected 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
this new statement provides a single definition of fair value  together with a framework for measuring it  and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets 
the original required effective date of sfas no 
was the first quarter of  however  the fasb issued fasb staff position  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which deferred the adoption date by one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
we are currently evaluating the impact sfas no 
may have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various types of transactions involving financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
commodity risk cash flow hedges as part of our risk management strategy  we use derivative instruments to protect cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in commodity prices for periods of up to twelve months 
these hedging activities are conducted to protect gross margins to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility could have on operating results by minimizing our exposure to price volatility on ethanol sale and purchase commitments where the price is to be set at a future date and or if the contract specifies a floating or index based price for ethanol that is based on either the new york mercantile exchange price of gasoline or the chicago board of trade price of ethanol 
in addition  we hedge anticipated sales of ethanol to minimize our exposure to the potentially adverse effects of price volatility 
these derivatives are designated and documented as sfas no 
cash flow hedges and effectiveness is evaluated by assessing the probability of the anticipated transactions and regressing commodity futures prices against our purchase and sales prices 
ineffectiveness  which is defined as the degree to which the derivative does not offset the underlying exposure  is recognized immediately in income 
for the year ended december   a gain from ineffectiveness in the amount of  and an effective loss in the amount of  were recorded in cost of goods sold 
for the year ended december   losses of ineffectiveness in the amount of  and an effective loss in the amount of  were recorded in cost of goods sold 
for the year ended december   an effective gain in the amount of  was recorded in sales 
amounts remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income loss will be reclassified to income upon the recognition of the related purchase or sale 
accumulated other comprehensive loss in the amount of  associated with commodity cash flow hedges is expected to be recognized in income over the next twelve months 
the notional balance of these derivatives as of december  and was  and  respectively 
commodity risk non designated derivatives as part of our risk management strategy  we use forward contracts on corn  crude oil and reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending gasoline to lock in prices for certain amounts of corn  denaturant and ethanol  respectively 
these derivatives are not designated under sfas no 
for special hedge accounting treatment 
the changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded on the balance sheet and recognized immediately in cost of goods sold 
we recognized a loss of  of which  is related to settled non designated hedges and as the change in the fair value of these contracts for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the notional balances remaining on the contracts as of december  and were  and  respectively 
interest rate risk as part of our interest rate risk management strategy  we use derivative instruments to minimize significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from rising variable interest rate costs associated with existing and anticipated borrowings 
to meet these objectives we purchased interest rate caps and swaps 
the rate for notional balances of interest rate caps ranging from to  is per annum 
the rate for notional balances of interest rate swaps ranging from to  is per annum 
these derivatives are designated and documented as sfas no 
cash flow hedges and effectiveness is evaluated by assessing the probability of anticipated interest expense and regressing the historical value of the rates against the historical value in the existing and anticipated debt 
ineffectiveness  reflecting the degree to which the derivative does not offset the underlying exposure  is recognized immediately in income 
for the year ended december   losses from ineffectiveness in the amount of  losses from effectiveness in the amount of  and losses from undesignated hedges in the amount of  were recorded in other income expense 
for the year ended december   ineffectiveness in the amount of  was recorded in other income expense 
there was no ineffectiveness for the year ended december  amounts remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to income upon the recognition of the hedged interest expense 
for the year ending december   we anticipate reclassifying  to income associated with our cash flow interest rate caps and swaps 
we marked all of our derivative instruments to fair value at each period end  except for those derivative contracts which qualified for the normal purchase and sale exemption pursuant to sfas no 
according to our designation of the derivative  changes in the fair value of derivatives are reflected in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income 
accumulated other comprehensive income accumulated other comprehensive income relative to derivatives for the year ended december  is as follows in thousands commodity derivatives interest rate derivatives gain loss gain loss beginning balance  january  net changes less amount reclassified to cost of goods sold less amount reclassified to other income expense ending balance  december  calculated on a pretax basis the estimated fair values of our derivatives were as follows in thousands december  commodity futures interest rate options total material limitations the disclosures with respect to the above noted risks do not take into account the underlying commitments or anticipated transactions 
if the underlying items were included in the analysis  the gains or losses on the futures contracts may be offset 
actual results will be determined by a number of factors that are not generally under our control and could vary significantly from the factors disclosed 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the above instruments  as well as credit or performance risk with respect to our hedged customers commitments 
although nonperformance is possible  we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of these parties
