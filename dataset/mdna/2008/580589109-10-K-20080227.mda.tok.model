item selected financial data 
the following table summarizes the company s selected financial data for the five years ended december  and should be read in conjunction with the detailed consolidated financial statements and related notes reported in item below 
selected consolidated financial data in thousands  except per share data year ended december  operations data revenues rental rental related services rental operations sales other total revenues costs and expenses direct costs of rental operations depreciation of rental equipment rental related services other total direct costs of rental operations cost of sales total costs gross profit selling and administrative income from operations interest expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes income before minority interest minority interest in income of subsidiary net income earnings per share basic diluted shares used in per share calculations basic diluted balance sheet data at period end rental equipment  at cost rental equipment  net total assets notes payable shareholders equity shares issued and outstanding book value per share debt total liabilities to equity debt notes payable to equity return on average equity cash dividends declared per common share to supplement the company s financial data presented on a basis consistent with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company presents adjusted ebitda which is defined by the company as net income before minority interest in income of subsidiary  interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation  amortization  and non cash stock based compensation 
the company presents adjusted ebitda as a financial measure as management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the company s liquidity and financial condition and because management  as well as the company s lenders use this measure in evaluating the performance of the company 
management uses adjusted ebitda as a supplement to gaap measures to further evaluate the company s period to period operating performance and evaluate the company s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
management believes the exclusion of non cash charges  including stock based compensation  is useful in measuring the company s cash available to operations and the performance of the company 
because the company finds adjusted ebitda useful  the company believes its investors will also find adjusted ebitda useful in evaluating the company s performance 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  cash flows  or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or as a measure of the company s profitability or liquidity 
adjusted ebitda is not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap  and may be different from non gaap measures used by other companies 
unlike ebitda which may be used by other companies or investors  adjusted ebitda does not include stock based compensation charges and income from the minority interest in the company s enviroplex subsidiary 
the company believes that adjusted ebitda is of limited use in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company s results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and does not accurately reflect real cash flow 
in addition  other companies may not use adjusted ebitda or may use other non gaap measures  limiting the usefulness of adjusted ebitda 
therefore  adjusted ebitda should only be used to evaluate the company s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures 
the presentation of adjusted ebitda is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable gaap measures 
the company compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda by relying upon gaap results to gain a complete picture of the company s performance 
since adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure as defined by the securities and exchange commission  the company includes in the tables below reconciliations of adjusted ebitda to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  net income minority interest in income of subsidiary provision for income taxes interest expense income from operations depreciation and amortization non cash stock based compensation adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  adjusted ebitda interest paid income taxes paid gain on sale of rental equipment change in certain assets and liabilities accounts receivable  net prepaid expenses and other assets accounts payable and other liabilities deferred income net cash provided by operating activities adjusted ebitda is defined as net income before minority interest in income of subsidiary  interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation  amortization  non cash stock based compensation and non cash impairment charges 
adjusted ebitda margin is calculated as adjusted ebitda divided by total revenues for the period 
adjusted ebitda is a component of two restrictive financial covenants for the company s unsecured line of credit and senior notes due in under these agreements  the company is subject to the following financial covenants maintain a leverage ratio of funded debt to adjusted ebitda as defined not to exceed 
at december  the actual ratio was maintain a fixed charge coverage of adjusted ebitda to fixed charges of at least 
at december  the actual ratio was 
at december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
there are no anticipated trends that the company is aware of that would indicate non compliance with these covenants  though  significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the company s ability to comply with these covenants
