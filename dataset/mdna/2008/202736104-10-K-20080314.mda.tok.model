significant categories of earning assets are loans and investment securities  while deposits and short term borrowings represent the major portion of interest bearing liabilities 
the level of net interest income is impacted primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities  as well as changes in interest rates when compared to previous periods of operations

credit risk arises through the extension of loans  leases  certain securities and financial guarantees 
to manage this risk  the company establishes policies and procedures to manage both on and off balance sheet risk and communicates and monitors the application of these policies and procedures throughout the company 
the company s credit risk is centered in its loan portfolio 
provision and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the annual cost of maintaining an allowance for inherent credit losses 
the amount of the provision each year and the level of the allowance are matters of judgment and are impacted by many factors  including actual credit losses during the period  the prospective view of credit losses  loan performance measures and trends such as delinquencies and charge offs  and other factors  both internal and external that may affect the quality and future loss experience of the credit portfolio 
the company continuously reviews its loan portfolio and maintains an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
in addition to the review of credit quality through an ongoing credit review process and a monthly review of impaired loans by management and the board  the company constructs a comprehensive allowance analysis for its loan portfolio at least quarterly 
this analysis includes three basic elements  a general allowance  specific allowances for identified problem loans and an unallocated allowance representing estimations done pursuant to either standard of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  or sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the specific component relates to loans that are classified as either doubtful  substandard or special mention 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
such qualitative factors management considers are the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  including adverse circumstances that may affect the ability of the borrower to repay interest and or principal  the estimated value of collateral  an analysis of the levels and trends of delinquencies  level of concentrations and growth within the portfolio  and the level and trend of interest rates and the condition of the national and local economies 
an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 
management s evaluation and resulting provision and allowance decisions are reviewed by the board of directors quarterly 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries

notwithstanding these allocations  the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb charge offs in any category of loan

it is management s practice to cease accruing interest on loans when payments are days delinquent 
however  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the estimated net realizable value of collateral is sufficient to cover the principal balance and accrued interest  and the loan is in the process of collection

table of contents non accrual loans increased thousand in to million 
non accrual loans at december  consist of sixteen loans 
million or of the total consists of five loans which are secured by real estate and management does not anticipate any material losses associated with these credits 
the remaining thousand in non accrual represents eleven loans  with the majority making monthly payments and in most cases are secured with workout arrangements currently in place 
management is closely monitoring these credits and believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to offset any potential loss that may occur 
if non accrual loans had been performing fully  these loans would have contributed an additional thousand to interest income in  thousand in  thousand in  thousand in and thousand in there was thousand in other real estate owned as of december   as compared to none at december   and and million at december  the balance at december  included two residential properties 
one of the properties is currently under contract with an expected closing during the first quarter of the second property is being actively marketed and is also expected to be sold in management does not anticipate any material losses associated with these properties 
the balance at december  included one commercial property and one residential property 
during  both properties were sold and resulted in a net loss of thousand 
the company continues to allocate significant resources to the expedient disposition and collection of non performing and other lower quality assets 
as a part of this workout process  the company routinely reevaluates all reasonable alternatives  including the sale of these assets 
individual action plans have been developed for each non performing asset 
uses of funds total average earning assets at december  increased from year end compared with s increase of from year end s increase of 
the increase in average earning assets over the last three years has been primarily attributable to the increase in the loan portfolio which has increased from million in to million in loan portfolio the loan portfolio is the largest component of earning assets and accounts for the greatest portion of total interest income 
as of december   total gross loans  including loans held for sale excluding unearned income  grew to a record million  a million or a increase from million at year end this is a continuation of the growth experienced from year end to year end of million or and from year end to year end of million or 
the tremendous growth experienced during the past three years was achieved not only by the high loan demand generated by the low interest rate environment and our strong local economy  but also by the efforts of the company s officers to develop new loan relationships combined with the support of existing customers 
in addition  during the first half of  the company added four of the leading veteran commercial lending officers to the company s professional team 
these professionals also contributed to the significant growth in the loan portfolio 
during the past three years  the company raised million in and million in  in additional capital  allowing us to continue our strong growth momentum and allowing us to better serve our customers by increasing our legal lending limit to over million as of december  during the past three years  a considerable volume of new loan relationships have been developed with old line and well established local businesses  who have transferred their relationships to the company from other regional financial institutions that are experiencing further consolidation 
this has been an excellent source of new business for the bank  as customers still value the personal attention traditionally offered by a community bank 
the bank intends to aggressively continue to target these relationships in future periods 
the company s overall objective in managing loan portfolio risk is to minimize the adverse impact of any single event or set of occurrences 
to achieve this objective  the company strives to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse in terms of loan type  industry concentration  geographic distribution and borrower concentration

table of contents construction and development loans increased million to million in compared to an increase of million to million in and an million increase to million in the company makes loans primarily for the construction of one to four family residences and  to a lesser extent  multi family dwellings 
the company also makes construction loans for office and warehouse facilities and other nonresidential projects  generally limited to borrowers that present other business opportunities for the company 
the amounts  interest rates and terms for construction loans vary  depending upon market conditions  the size and complexity of the project  and the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors of the loan 
the term for the company s typical construction loan ranges from nine months to months for the construction of an individual residence  and from months to a maximum of three years for larger residential or commercial projects 
the company does not typically amortize its construction loans  and the borrower pays interest monthly on the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
the interest rates on the company s construction loans are mostly variable 
the company does not generally finance the construction of commercial real estate projects built on a speculative basis 
for residential builder loans  the company limits the number of models and or speculative units allowed depending on market conditions  the builder s financial strength and track record and other factors 
construction loans for nonresidential projects and multi unit residential projects are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk to the company than residential mortgage loans 
the company attempts to minimize such risks by i making construction loans in accordance with the company s underwriting standards and to established customers in its primary market area and ii by monitoring the quality  progress and cost of construction 
loans in the commercial category  as well as commercial real estate mortgages  consist primarily of short term five year or less final maturity or five year rate call and or floating or adjustable rate commercial loans made to small to medium sized companies 
total commercial loans increased to million in compared with an increase of to million in and an increase of to million in virtually all of the company s commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans relate to property in our market areas of hampton roads and northeastern north carolina which includes the cities of norfolk  virginia beach  chesapeake  portsmouth and suffolk  virginia and the outer banks of north carolina 
as such  they are subject to risks relating to the general economic conditions in those markets  and the market for real estate in particular 
these regions have experienced solid economic activity during  and  the local real estate market remains steady  and the company attempts to mitigate risk through careful underwriting  including primary reliance on the borrower s financial capacity and the ability to repay without resort to the property  and lends primarily with respect to properties occupied  or managed by the owner 
residential mortgage loans increased million or in  compared to an increase of million or in  and an increase of million or to million in the company s family residential real estate loans are generally not the typical purchase money first mortgage loan or refinancing  but are loans made for other purposes and the collateral obtained is a first deed of trust on the residential property of the borrower

these loans are pre committed for sale prior to funding and are secured by first deeds of trust on residential to family dwellings 
the company will continue with its efforts to develop creditable loan relationships in order to enhance its earnings opportunities while simultaneously strengthening its underwriting criteria 
to limit credit exposure  the company obtains collateral to support credit extensions and commitments when deemed necessary 
the most significant categories of collateral are real and personal property  cash on deposit and marketable securities 
the company obtains real property as security for some loans that are made on the basis of the general creditworthiness of the borrower and whose proceeds were not used for real estate related purposes 
a number of measures have been taken by the company over the past several years to reduce overall exposure and earnings vulnerability in the real estate sectors of the bank s trade area 
these measures include strengthening real estate underwriting  management review of policies and practices  and reducing higher risk concentrations within the real estate portfolio 
senior level management is devoted to the management and or collection of certain non performing assets as well as certain performing loans 
aggressive collection strategies and a proactive approach to managing overall credit risk has expedited the company s disposition  collection and re negotiation of non performing and other lower quality assets and allowed loan officers to concentrate on generating new business 
the following table shows the maturity or period of re pricing of gross loans outstanding as of december  demand loans  as well as loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due within one year 
adjustable and floating rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in which they contractually mature 
fixed rate loans are included in the period in which the final contractual repayment is due 
since the majority of the company s loan portfolio is short term  the company can re price its portfolio more frequently to minimize long term interest rate fluctuations and maintain a steady interest margin

the company s efficiency ratio tax equivalent basis was for the year ended december   compared to in and in salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of noninterest expense  increased by in following an increase of in and in these increases were driven by annual merit increases  the addition of several new positions during  and  including the staff needed for the two new branches added in late  the new branch opened in the second quarter of and the six new branches added in  an increase in certain employee benefit costs experienced in each year  and the creation of the title company and investment company during the company is currently servicing a record number of deposit and loan accounts 
to support this growth  along with the legislation and requirements relating to the sarbanes oxley act  the bank secrecy act  the patriot act  the fair credit reporting act  the gramm leach bliley act  and others  the company had to deploy significant resources including additional employees who can devote the time and attention necessary to ensure ongoing compliance with each of these important policies 
salaries and benefit costs associated with the mortgage company were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
salaries and benefit costs associated with the title company were thousand  thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively 
salaries and benefit costs associated with the investment company were thousand  thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase can be attributable to the opening of two new branches during  the new branch opened in the second quarter of  the six new branches opened in  the improvements to several of the branch facilities  the cost of which qualified for capitalization and the occupancy cost associated with the mortgage  title and investment companies 
other noninterest operating expenses  which include a grouping of numerous transactions relating to normal banking operations  increased thousand or in  compared with million or in  and an increase of thousand or in the major part of this increase is the result of the company s investment in an extensive multimedia advertising campaign utilizing billboards  radio and newspaper to promote and reinforce its presence throughout southside hampton roads during  and advertising and marketing expense increased by in  following an increase of in and an increase of in bank franchise tax  which is based largely on outstanding equity at year end  has increased  and for  and  respectively as a result of our increased equity due to our record earnings and capital the company raised during the last several years

table of contents dividends and dividend policy the company s board of directors determines the amount of and whether or not to declare dividends 
such determinations by the board take into account the company s financial condition  results of operations and other relevant factors 
the company s only source of funds for cash dividends are dividends paid to the company by the bank 
in april  the company s board of directors approved a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
shares purchased from the company with reinvested dividends are issued at a five percent discount from the market value 
the plan also permits optional cash payments up to thousand per quarter for the purchase of additional shares of common stock 
these shares are issued at market value  without incurring brokerage commissions 
based on the company s outstanding financial performance for the year ended december   the company paid out quarterly cash dividends for a total of per share or a increase over the year ended december  on february and may   the company paid a cash dividend

the federal reserve  the office of the controller of the currency and the fdic have issued risk based capital guidelines for us banking organizations 
these guidelines provide a capital framework that is sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking companies 
risk based capital ratios are another measure of capital adequacy 
on october  and june   the parent generated million and million  respectively  in new regulatory capital through the private placement of its common stock 
on november   the parent generated million in new regulatory capital from the initial funding of a trust preferred securities offering 
under federal reserve bank rules  the company and the bank were considered well capitalized  the highest category of capitalization defined by the regulators as of december  the bank s risk adjusted capital ratios at december   were for tier and for total capital  well above the required minimums of and  respectively 
these ratios are calculated using regulatory capital either tier or total capital as the numerator and both on and off balance sheet risk weighted assets as the denominator 
tier capital consists primarily of common equity less goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
total capital adds certain qualifying debt instruments and a portion of the allowance for loan losses to tier capital 
one of four risk weights  primarily based on credit risk  is applied to both on and off balance sheet assets to determine the asset denominator 
in order to maintain a strong equity capital position and to protect against the risks of loss in the investment and loan portfolios and on other assets  management will continue to monitor the bank s capital position 
several measures have been or will be employed to maintain the bank s capital position  including but not limited to continuing its efforts to return all non performing assets to performing status  monitoring the bank s growth  and continued utilization of its formal asset liability policy 
once again  it should be noted that the bank s capital position has always exceeded and continues to exceed the minimum standards established by the regulatory authorities 
liquidity bank liquidity is a measure of the ability to generate and maintain sufficient cash flows to fund operations and to meet financial obligations to depositors and borrowers promptly and in a cost effective manner 
asset liquidity is provided primarily by maturing loans and investments  and by cash received from operations 
other sources of asset liquidity include readily marketable assets  especially short term investments  and long term investment securities that can serve as collateral for borrowings 
on the liability side  liquidity is affected by the timing of maturing liabilities and the ability to generate new deposits or borrowings as needed 
the company maintains a liquid portfolio of both assets and liabilities and attempts to mitigate the risk inherent in changing rates in this manner 
cash  interest bearing deposits in banks  federal funds sold and investments classified as available for sale totaled  and million as of december   and  respectively 
to provide liquidity for current ongoing and unanticipated needs  the company maintains a portfolio of marketable investment securities  and structures and monitors the flow of funds from these securities and from maturing loans 
the company maintains access to short term funding sources as well  including a federal funds line of credit with its correspondent banks up to million  the ability to borrow from the federal reserve system up to thousand and from the federal home loan bank of atlanta up to million 
as a result of the company s management of liquid assets  and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  including the use of broker certificates of deposit  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositor s requirements and to meet customers credit needs 

table of contents the company s asset liability management committee alco is responsible for formulating liquidity strategies  monitoring performance based on established objectives and approving new liquidity initiatives 
alco s overall objective is to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity needs  the interest rate and economic outlook  market opportunities and customer requirements 
general strategies to accomplish this objective include maintaining a strong balance sheet  achieving solid core deposit growth  taking on manageable interest rate risk and adhering to conservative financial management on a daily basis 
these strategies are monitored regularly by alco and reviewed periodically with the board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations to meet the financing needs of customers  the company is a party  in the normal course of business  to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  commitments to sell loans and standby letters of credit 
for further information on off balance commitments see note financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  in the consolidated financial statements included as exhibit of this form k 
the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations  contingent obligations and certain other off balance sheet commitments outstanding as of december  table contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations other liabilities on balance sheet under gaap federal home loan bank advances trust preferred capital notes long term debt off balance sheet commitments standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit total contractual obligations inflation the company carefully reviews federal reserve monetary policy in order to ensure an appropriate position between the cost and utilization of funds 
the effect of changing prices on financial institutions is typically different than on non banking companies since virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
in particular  interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes is directly related to price level indices 
accordingly  management believes the company can best counter inflation over the long term by managing net interest income and controlling net increases in noninterest income and expenses 
critical accounting policies certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s most critical accounting policy relates to the company s allowance for loan losses  which reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company s borrowers to make required loan payments 
if the financial condition of the company s borrowers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  the company s estimates would be updated and additional provisions for loan losses may be required 
further discussion of the estimates used in determining the allowance for loan losses is contained in note to consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk is exposure to interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of interest income and interest expense and the market value of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
based on the nature of the company s operations  it is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank s loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in the hampton roads and northeastern north carolina areas  including the cities of norfolk  virginia beach  chesapeake  portsmouth and suffolk  virginia and the outer banks of north carolina and is  therefore  subject to risks associated with these local economies 
as of december   the company does not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps or caps 
the primary goal of the company s asset liability management strategy is to optimize net interest income while limiting exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in the interest rate environment 
the company s ability to manage its interest rate risk depends generally on the company s ability to match the maturities and re pricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities while taking into account the separate goals of maintaining asset quality and liquidity and achieving the desired level of net interest income 
the company s management  guided by the alco  determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these decisions are based on management s expectations regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the national and regional economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
the company uses a variety of traditional and on balance sheet tools to manage its interest rate risk 
gap analysis  which monitors the gap between interest sensitive assets and liabilities  is one such tool 
in addition  the company uses simulation modeling to forecast future balance sheet and income statement behavior 
by studying the effects on net interest income of rising  stable and falling interest rate scenarios  the company can position itself to take advantage of anticipated interest rate movements  and protect itself from unanticipated interest rate movements  by understanding the dynamic nature of its balance sheet components 
earnings simulation analysis management uses simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
the model calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates 
this method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process 
assumptions used in the model are derived from historical trends  peer analysis and management s outlook 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities prepayment assumptions are based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates 
interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and are reflected in the different rate scenarios 
many factors affect the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes on financial instruments 
consequently  variations should be expected from the projections resulting from the controlled conditions of the simulation analysis 
the following table represents the interest rate sensitivity on net interest income for the company for the twelve months following each of the two year ends and  using different rate scenarios change in prime rate change in net interest income change in net interest income basis points basis points basis points basis points 
table of contents market value simulation market value simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments 
market values are calculated based on the discounted cash flow analysis 
the net market value is the market value of all assets minus the market value of all liabilities 
the change in net market value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer term interest rate risk in the balance sheet 
similar assumptions are used in the market value simulation as in the earnings simulation 
the following table reflects the change in net market value over different rate environments change in prime rate change in net market value change in net market value basis points basis points basis points basis points another technique for managing its interest rate risk exposure is the management of the company s interest sensitivity gap 
the interest sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or re price within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or re price within that time period 
at december   the company s one year positive gap interest earning assets maturing or re pricing within a period exceed interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing within the same period was approximately million  or of total assets 
thus  during periods of rising interest rates  this implies that the company s net interest income would be positively affected because the yield on the company s interest earning assets is likely to rise more quickly than the cost of its interest bearing liabilities 
in periods of falling interest rates  the opposite effect on net interest income is likely to occur 
the table below sets forth the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  and that are subject to re pricing or that mature in each of the future time periods shown 
loans and securities with call or balloon provisions are included in the period in which they balloon or may first be called 
long term debt advances from federal home loan bank of atlanta is included in the period in which they contractually mature 
each contains certain conversion options that may cause the advances to mature or convert prior to final maturity 
the trust preferred capital notes are included in the period in which they may first be redeemed 
except as stated above  the amount of assets and liabilities shown that re price or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
in making the gap computations  none of the assumptions sometimes made regarding prepayment rates and deposit decay rates have been used for any interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  the table does not reflect scheduled principal payments which will be received throughout the lives of the loans
