table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview general we are a petroleum company engaged primarily in the acquisition  exploitation and development of properties for the production of crude oil and natural gas 
we acquire known  underdeveloped oil and natural gas resources and exploit them through the application of capital and technology to increase production  ultimate recoveries  or both 
our strategy is intended to generate scalable development opportunities at normally pressured depths  exhibiting relatively low completion risk  generally longer and more predictable production lives  less expenditures on infrastructure and lower operational risks 
within this overall strategy  we pursue three specific initiatives i enhanced oil recovery eor  using miscible and immiscible gas flooding  ii conventional redevelopment of bypassed primary resource within mature oil and natural gas fields utilizing modern technology and our expertise  and iii unconventional gas resource development  using modern stimulation and completion technologies 
our most significant asset is within our eor initiative in the  acre delhi field  located in northeast louisiana 
our non operated interests consist of in overriding and mineral royalty interests and a after pay out reversionary working interest in the delhi field holt bryant unit  along with a working interest in certain other depths in the delhi field resulting from the delhi farmout 
the holt bryant unit is currently being redeveloped by the operator  denbury resources inc denbury  using co enhanced oil recovery technology and a dedicated portion of denbury s proved co reserves in the jackson dome  approximately miles east of delhi 
injection of co is expected to begin during the first half of calendar  followed by projected increases in oil production on or about late calendar since our closing of the delhi farmout  we have focused on developing projects in our other initiatives  particularly through conventional redevelopment of bypassed resources in the giddings field using horizontal drilling methods  and the leasing of unconventional gas shale projects in the woodford shale trend in oklahoma 
conceptually  our plan going forward can be illustrated as follows 
gbaijpg 
as indicated by the above chart  volumes are representative and not to scale  we are funding our current development projects in the giddings field and leasing in our gas shale projects with our working capital resources 
we expect that net cash flows from our properties in the giddings field  our current cash resources and cash flows from the delhi project will be used to fund our gas shale projects and other new projects 

table of contents highlights for the year ended june  we reported earnings for the quarter ended june  we reported positive earnings from operations for the quarter ended june  during the quarter ended june   operating income was  and net income before income taxes was  this compares to an operating loss of  and net loss before income taxes of  for the comparable fiscal period 
we substantially increased our proved reserves and high graded our production and reserve base  redeploying assets from the tullos field area to the giddings field  within our bypassed resource initiative proved reserves increased from mmboe to mmboe  despite production  adjustments and sales of minerals in place totaling approximately mmboe 
through leasing and development activities in the giddings field during fiscal  we added mmboe to the mmboe of proved reserves we owned at july  additions were offset by mmboe of reductions  consisting of mboe of production  mboe of downward revisions and mboe of divested proved reserves from our properties in the tullos field area 
proved locations in the giddings field increased from locations at the beginning of the year  to locations and seven production wells wells and locations at july  proved developed reserves began the year at mboe  all located at our now divested properties in the tullos field area  and ended the year at mboe  all located in the giddings field 
sales volumes increased during the three and twelve months ended june  vs 
 respectively 
gains were solely attributable to our new production in the giddings field  with primary production beginning almost simultaneously with the march  sale of our historical production base in the tullos field area 
our first well in the giddings field began production in late february  two more wells began production in mid march  and four wells began production in may and june 
despite the delay in obtaining full productive rates in several of our first wells in the giddings field due to drilling fluid production  june averaged net boepd of production approximately gross boepd 
we lowered per barrel lifting costs by  or per boe  during our most recent fiscal quarter  while depletion increased less than per boe 
lifting costs were per boe during the quarter ended june   our first quarter that included only production from our properties in the giddings field 
during the quarter ended september   the last quarter that included only production from our properties in the tullos field area  lifting costs averaged per bo 
due to additions of reserves at the giddings field during the period  which are higher than our historical acquisition costs of our properties in the tullos field area  our depletion rate rose from to per boe 
the forgoing was a result of redeploying our working capital and the proceeds from the sale of our properties in the tullos field area into acquisitions and drilling at our properties in the giddings field 
on march   we completed the sale of our properties in the tullos field area for gross cash proceeds of approximately million 
while only producing about gross and net barrels of oil production per day from over producing wells  these properties required a disproportionate amount of staff effort and vendor services  thereby adversely affecting our ability to develop other projects utilizing our expertise and working capital 
furthermore  we believed the potential upside in the tullos field area was substantially less than our other projects  particularly as compared to our properties in the giddings field 
we also completed the testing of our completion technology utilizing the one well we drilled in the tullos field area and determined that the potential of that technology would be best realized in other  less depleted fields 
in late we bean leasing in the giddings field  and in late calendar we initiated a redevelopment drilling program targeting the austin chalk formation 
initially composed of ten re entries  we subsequently revised the program to six wells with an aggregate horizontal footage exceeding the initial ten well program 
this drilling was completed by fiscal year end  albeit at a higher capital cost than originally expected due to higher well service and materials costs  unexpected downhole problems in the wells being re entered  overall learning curve costs associated with starting a new program and higher loss of drilling fluid than expected 
as of june   seven wells have been placed in production  including five wells that were re entered for additional drilling and recompletion  one new well that was drilled and completed  and one well that was restored to production 
to date  results of the drilling program are consistent with our expectations and we continue to move forward in our program of converting existing proved undeveloped locations to producing well status 

table of contents our delhi eor co project continued to progress denbury charged million of capital to delhi during calendar  and announced an million budget for we understand that the mississippi river crossing permits have been obtained by the corps of engineers  and that the final leg of the co supply pipeline and field preparations were actively being constructed 
denbury  the operator of the delhi holt bryant unit  reported to us that  as of december   approximately million of capital has been charged to the delhi project  excluding the million they paid to us in denbury  disclosed a capital expenditure budget of million for calendar year for the completion of the co supply pipeline to delhi and related field activities 
although we don t control the operations  we expect that oil production response will occur within six months of first injection and that the field oil production rate will steadily increase from that point 
we have no expected capital expenditure requirements related to the ongoing co eor development at the delhi field  although we retain our separate overriding and mineral royalty interests and reversionary interest after payout 
we continued to advance our unconventional gas shale projects we substantially increased our net acreage in our two woodford shale projects in oklahoma 
at june   we owned approximately  gross and  net acres in these projects  as compared to  gross and  net acres at june  offset operators have announced the drilling and completion of numerous wells in the immediate areas 
we remained financially strong we protected our short term investments during difficult credit market conditions 
we maintained our cash liquidity by continuing to avoid structurally enhanced investment securities  auction rate securities and other questionable credit instruments 
instead  we relied upon lower yielding us government agency money market funds during fiscal in july  we moved our investments into us treasury money market funds to avoid agency exposure 
we remained debt free 
looking forward in fiscal we expect to increase development drilling expenditures by  and decrease land expenditures by 
we currently expect capital expenditures of million during fiscal  of which approximately million will be dedicated to development drilling and the balance to leasehold acquisitions 
this compares to approximately million of development drilling expenditures and approximately million of land acquisition expenditures during fiscal drilling expenditures of approximately million will be focused on our properties in the giddings field  with additional expenditures for initial test drilling in our woodford shale projects 
although at a lesser pace  we will continue to acquire additional proved locations in the giddings field 
we expect to begin a new project within our bypassed resource initiative 
our capital budget includes the acquisition of leases within a new project and application of the technology we tested at the tullos field area 
expenditures for this project are scheduled for late fiscal on a mature field in texas 
we expect first injection of co at delhi in the first half of calendar based on the operator s current plans  denbury should be injecting co at delhi in the first half of calendar  with expected oil production accruing to us from our overriding and royalty interests on or about late calendar we expect to preserve our financial strength 
we recognize that the world and us economies are experiencing unprecedented credit market stress and volatility  which makes us even more determined to live within our means 
consequently  we may reduce capital expenditures from our budget based on a number of factors  including changes in the commodity prices that we expect to receive  drilling and production performance results from new and existing wells  unexpected changes in our working capital  insufficient joint venture capital  or such other factors as we deem appropriate 
we believe any retrenchment would be brief  only serving as a bridge to reach our expected annuity from delhi production  which appears to be around the corner for the benefit of our shareholders 
liquidity and capital resources at june   our working capital  predominately cash and cash equivalents  was approximately million and we continued to be debt free 
this compares to working capital of approximately million at june  of the million decrease in working capital since june  approximately million was used for capital expenditures on oil and natural gas leasehold and development costs  approximately million was used for capital expenditures on other property and equipment  and approximately million was used in operations  offset by net proceeds from the sale of our properties in the tullos field area of approximately million and an increase of approximately million in net operating assets 
for the year ended june   approximately million was used in operations 
this compares to approximately million used in operations for the year ended june   which included approximately million paid for income taxes 
cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately million during the year ended june  this compared to approximately million provided by investing activities for the year ended june  during the current fiscal period approximately million of cash was used for investments to acquire and develop oil and natural gas property interests  which does not include approximately million net change in accounts payable from july  relating to expenditures for oil and natural gas properties  and approximately million of asset retirement costs 
we also acquired approximately million in other property and equipment 
the sale of our properties in the tullos field area partially offset our acquisition and development activities by providing net proceeds of approximately million 

table of contents during the year ended june   we received million from the qualified intermediary account representing unspent like kind exchange funds from the delhi farmout  partially offset by approximately million of cash used for investments to acquire and develop oil and natural gas property interests and other property and equipment 
there were no significant cash flows from financing activities during the years ended june  and we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures for oil and natural gas leasehold and development costs during the year ended june  compared to approximately million during the year ended june   including approximately million for leasehold acquisitions and approximately million for development activities 
we expect our capital expenditures for oil and natural gas leasehold and development costs to continue during the fiscal year related to diminished incremental leasing in the giddings field and in our gas shale projects in oklahoma 
based on our current plans  we expect capital expenditures to approximate million during fiscal  with approximately million dedicated to development drilling and the balance to leasehold acquisitions 
we expect to fund our development drilling and acquisition activities for fiscal year primarily from current working capital and cash provided by our operations in the giddings field  supplemented by up to million from joint ventures

table of contents sales volumes 
crude oil  natural gas liquids  and natural gas sales volumes  net to our interest  for the year ended june  increased to  boe  compared to  boe for the year ended june  the increase in sales volumes is due primarily to new production of crude oil  ngls and natural gas from our properties in the giddings field 
of the  boe sold during the year ended june   the tullos field area  which was sold on march   accounted for approximately  boe or approximately of total sales volumes 
for the year ended june   the tullos field area accounted for  boe or approximately of total sales volumes

during our ownership  we had no ngl or natural gas production from our properties in the tullos field area 
production 
oil production will vary from oil sales volumes by changes in crude oil inventories  which are not carried on our balance sheet 
crude oil  ngl and natural gas production for the year ended june  increased to  boe  compared to  boe for the year ended june  the increase is primarily due to oil  ngl and natural gas production from our properties in the giddings field 
production from the tullos field area  which was sold on march   accounted for approximately of production for the year ended june  compared to approximately for the year ended june  oil  ngl and natural gas revenues 
revenues presented in the table above and discussed herein represent revenue from sales of our oil and natural gas production volumes  net to our interest 
in the previous year  production sold under fixed price delivery contracts  which have been designated for the normal purchase and sale exemption under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  are also included in these amounts 
realized prices may differ from market prices in effect during the periods  depending on when the fixed delivery contract was executed 
crude oil  ngl and natural gas revenues for the year ended june  increased from the previous fiscal year 
this was due to a increase in the price of a bbl of oil  from per bbl to per bbl  along with sales of ngls and natural gas during the year ended june   whereas there were no sales of ngls and natural gas during the year ended june  oil revenues from our properties in the tullos field area  which was sold in march  were  or approximately of total revenues  for the year ended june   compared to  or approximately of total revenues  for the year ended june  lease operating expenses including production severance taxes 
lease operating expenses for the year ended june  decreased approximately from the comparable period 
the overall decrease in lease operating expenses in is primarily attributable to lower field expenses in the giddings field as compared to the tullos field area and the inclusion of only eight months of field expense due to the sale of our properties in the tullos field area in early march on a boe basis  lease operating expenses decreased by over the comparable period  due to lower lease operating costs and higher sales volumes 
general and administrative expenses g a 
g a expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended june   compared to approximately million for the year ended june  higher overall compensation expenses for estimated bonuses and new hires accounted for the majority of the increase 
new hires are associated with a build up of our infrastructure to execute our drilling program in the giddings field 
non cash stock based compensation expense was  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
depreciation  depletion amortization expense dd a 
dd a expense increased  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  the increase is primarily due to a higher depletion rate vs 
per boe and a increase in sales volumes 
the increase in the depletion rate is due to the higher development cost of puds in the giddings field that we added in replacement of our lower cost pdp s from our properties in the tullos field area  which we sold in march 
table of contents interest income 
interest income for the year ended june  decreased  to  compared to  for the year ended june  the decrease in interest income is due to lower available cash balances averaging approximately million during the year ended june   as compared to cash balances averaging approximately million during the year ended june   combined with a lower interest rate environment during the year ended june  the lower cash balance is mostly due to cash used to pay income taxes arising from the million we received from the delhi farmout and for additions to our oil and natural gas properties 
inflation 
although the general inflation rate in the united states  as measured by the consumer price index and the producer price index  has been relatively low in recent years  the oil and gas industry has experienced unusually high price increases for oilfield equipment  tubulars  labor and services for the years ended june  and similarly  the prices we received for our products during this period has also increased dramatically  thereby offsetting material impacts on our results of operations 
seasonality 
our business is generally not seasonal  except for certain rare instances when weather conditions may adversely affect access to our properties 
although we do not generally modify our production for changes in market demand  we do experience seasonality in the product prices we receive  generally based on higher demand for natural gas in the summer and winter and higher demand for downstream oil products during the summer driving season 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we select certain accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these policies  together with our estimates have a significant affect on our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
oil and natural gas properties 
companies engaged in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
we apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
another acceptable method of accounting for oil and natural gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting 
in general  the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment 
under the full cost method  all geological and geophysical costs  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool  whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred 
in the assessment of impairment of oil and natural gas properties  the successful efforts method follows the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  under which the net book value of assets are measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method  the full cost pool net book value of oil and natural gas properties is measured against future net cash flows discounted at using commodity prices in effect at the end of the reporting period 
the financial results for a given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting that a company adopts 
oil and natural gas reserves  depletion  and the ceiling test 
under full cost accounting  the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows used to calculate depletion and to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions  which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  additional development activity  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare the report  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for the properties make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statements 

table of contents material revisions to reserve estimates and or significant changes in commodity prices could substantially affect our estimated future net cash flows of our proved reserves  affecting our quarterly full cost ceiling test calculation and could significantly affect our dd a rate 
a decrease in commodity prices as of june   would not result in an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties 
a increase in our estimate of proved reserves quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter dd a rate from per boe to per boe  and a decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our dd a rate to approximately per boe 
unproved properties 
on a quarterly basis  the costs of unproved properties are evaluated for inclusion in the costs to be amortized resulting from the determination of proved reserves or impairment 
to the extent that the evaluation indicates these properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
impairments and abandonments of unproved properties are accounted for as an adjustment to capitalized costs related to proved oil and natural gas properties  with no losses recognized 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes 
our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared or filed  therefore  we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits  and net operating loss carry backs and carry forwards 
adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns 
further  we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets primarily our net operating loss 
if recovery is not likely  we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover  which would result in an increase to our income tax expense 
as of june   we have recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of our net operating loss that is limited by irs section management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making the assessment of the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  as of end of the current fiscal year  we believe that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets 
if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this valuation method requires the input of certain assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected term of the award  the expected risk free interest rate  and the expected dividend yield of the company s stock 
the risk free interest rates used is the us treasury yield for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant 
our dividend yield is zero  as we do not pay a dividend 
because of our limited trading experience of our common stock and limited exercise history of our stock option awards  estimating the volatility and expected term is very subjective 
we base our estimate of our expected future volatility  on peer companies whose common stock has been trading longer than ours  along with our own limited trading history while operating as an oil and natural gas producer 
future estimates of our stock volatility could be substantially different from our current estimate  which could significantly affect the amount of expense we recognize for our stock based compensation awards 
an increase of in our current estimated volatility from the current volatility of to would increase the fair value of future grants of stock options approximately 
conversely  a decrease of in our current estimated volatility would decrease the fair value of future grants of stock options approximately 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements at june  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
commodity price risk our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  as  if and when needed 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce 
although our current production base may not be sufficient enough to effectively allow hedging  we may periodically use derivative instruments to hedge our commodity price risk 
we may hedge a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations 
we may use futures contracts  swaps and fixed price physical contracts to hedge our commodity prices 
realized gains and losses from our price risk management activities are recognized in oil and natural gas sales when the associated production occurs 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes
