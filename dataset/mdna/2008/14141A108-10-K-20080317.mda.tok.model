readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
we undertake no obligation to revise any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise 
readers are urged to review and consider carefully the various disclosures made in this report and in our other filings made with the sec that disclose and describe the risks and factors that may affect our business  prospects and results of operations 
the terms the company  us  we and our refer to cardiac science corporation and our majority owned subsidiaries 
business overview we develop  manufacture  and market a family of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic cardiology devices and systems  including automated external defibrillators aeds  electrocardiograph systems ecgs  stress test systems  holter monitoring systems  hospital defibrillators  cardiac rehabilitation telemetry systems  and cardiology data management systems informatics that connect with hospital information his  electronic medical record emr  and other information systems 
we sell a variety of related products and consumables  and provide a portfolio of training  maintenance  and support services 
we are the successor to the cardiac businesses that established the trusted burdick  heartcentrix  powerheart  and quinton brands and are headquartered in bothell  washington 
we distribute our products in more than countries worldwide  with operations in north america  europe  and asia 
cardiac science corporation was incorporated in delaware on february  as csq holding company to effect the business combination of quinton cardiology systems  inc quinton and cardiac science  inc csi  which we refer to as the merger transaction 
the merger transaction was consummated on september  in connection with the merger transaction  the outstanding shares of common stock of quinton and csi were cancelled and stockholders of quinton and csi were issued common stock of cardiac science corporation in consideration of their shares of quinton and csi common stock 
stockholders of quinton received share of our common stock for each common share of quinton held  representing approximately of our total outstanding common stock as of the date of closing  and holders of csi common stock received share of our common stock for each common share of csi held  which  together with  shares of our common stock issued to the holders of senior notes and related warrants of csi in connection with the merger transaction  represented approximately of our total outstanding common stock as of the date of closing 
in addition  we assumed each outstanding option and other warrant to purchase common stock issued by quinton and csi 
for accounting purposes  the merger transaction was treated as an acquisition by quinton of csi as of september  since we are deemed to be the successor to quinton for accounting purposes  our consolidated financial statements represent the historical statements of quinton and include csi s results of operations since september  all share and per share data have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the conversion of quinton shares into cardiac science corporation shares at the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement 
critical accounting estimates and policies to prepare financial statements that conform with us generally accepted accounting principles  we must select and apply accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the 
table of contents circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there are certain critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we reasonably could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
deferred tax assets and income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes 
this process involves calculating our current tax obligation or refund and assessing the nature and measurements of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in each period  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income 
if required  we will recognize a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we adjust our tax provision or tax benefit in the statement of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
stock based compensation 
as of january   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  and applied the provisions of securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating future volatility  expected term and the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in connection with acquisitions of our medical treadmill product line  burdick and csi 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances  for each reporting unit identified for purposes of accounting for goodwill 
a reporting unit represents a portion of our business for which we regularly review certain discrete financial information and operational results 
we have determined that we have two reporting units  consisting of our general cardiology products  which include our product service business  and the cardiac science shanghai joint venture  both of which operate in the cardiology market and have similar economic and operating characteristics 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit  and potentially result in recognition of an impairment of goodwill  which would be reflected as a loss on our statement of operations and as a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill 
we performed a test for goodwill impairment at november  in accordance with our policy for performing this test annually 
we did not record an impairment charge as a result of the analysis 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets are comprised primarily of trade names  developed technology  patent rights and customer relationships  all of which were acquired in our acquisition of burdick in  the merger transaction with csi in and the cross licensing agreement with koninklijke philips electronics nv philips in we use our judgment to estimate the fair value of each of these intangible assets 
our judgment about fair value is based on our expectation of future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate 
we also use our judgment to estimate the useful lives of each intangible asset 

table of contents we believe the burdick and cardiac science trade names have indefinite lives and  accordingly  we do not amortize the trade names 
we evaluate this conclusion annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired and make a judgment about whether there are factors that would limit our ability to benefit from the trade name in the future 
if there were such factors  we would start amortizing the trade name over the expected remaining period in which we believed it would continue to provide benefit 
with respect to our developed technology  customer relationship and patent rights  we also evaluate the remaining useful lives annually 
we periodically evaluate whether our intangible assets are impaired 
for our trade names  this evaluation is performed annually  or more frequently if events occur that suggest there may be an impairment loss  and involves comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of fair value 
for intangible assets related to developed technology  customer relationship and patent rights  this evaluation would be performed if events occur that suggest there may be an impairment loss 
if we conclude that any of our intangible assets is impaired  we would record this as a loss on our statement of operations and as a reduction to the intangible asset 
valuation of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and intangible assets subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized on our statement of operations and as a reduction to value of the asset group on our balance sheet if it is concluded that the fair value of the asset group is less than its carrying value 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
inventories 
inventories represent a significant portion of our assets 
we value inventories at the lower of cost  on an average cost basis  or market 
we regularly perform a detailed analysis of our inventories to determine whether adjustments are necessary to reduce inventory values to estimated net realizable value 
we consider various factors in making this determination  including the salability of individual items or classes of items  recent sales history and predicted trends  industry market conditions and general economic conditions 
different estimates regarding the net realizable value of inventories could have a material impact on our reported net inventory and cost of sales  and thus could have a material impact on the financial statements as a whole 
warranty 
we provide warranty service covering many of the products and systems we sell 
we estimate and accrue for future costs of providing warranty service  which relate principally to the hardware components of the systems  when the systems are sold 
our estimates are based in part on our warranty claims history and our cost to perform warranty service 
differences could result in the amount of the recorded warranty liability and cost of sales if we made different judgments or used different estimates 
licensing income and litigation settlement 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into a settlement agreement philips pursuant to which the parties agreed to dismiss all pending claims between the parties in consideration for cross licenses of certain patents between the parties and a million payment from us to philips 
the transaction was valued in accordance with accounting principals board opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  apb  as amended by sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 sfas 
the fair value of the intangible assets acquired of million and royalty income received of million was measured based upon estimated future royalty streams that would have been due to both parties for the use of their patents 
this fair value was then limited to the net present value of the payment streams 
we also recorded a gain on the transaction of million  included in licensing income and litigation settlement  because the fair value of the intangible assets received in the transaction was estimated to exceed the fair value of the intangible assets given up and  in our case  the cash paid 
the intangible assets value will be amortized to income based upon the remaining economic life of the patents of years  which will approximate million annually 
software revenue recognition 
we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of 
table of contents fair value exists for those elements 
customers may receive certain elements of our products over a period of time 
these elements include post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades enhancements on a when and if available basis  the fair value of which is recognized over the service period 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement and the ability to identify vsoe of fair value for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
with respect to arrangements where software is considered more than incidental to the product  the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for undelivered support is deferred and the residual fair value of delivered software is recognized 
revenue from software implementation services is recognized as the services are provided based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
when significant implementation activities are required  we recognize revenue from software and services upon installation 
we occasionally sell software and hardware upgrades on a stand alone basis 
revenue recognition 
revenue from sales of hardware products is generally recognized when title transfers to the customer  typically upon shipment 
some of our customers are distributors that sell goods to third party end users 
except for certain identified distributors where collection may be contingent on distributor resale  we recognize revenue on sales of products made to distributors when title transfers to the distributor and all significant obligations have been satisfied 
in making a determination of whether significant obligations have been met  we evaluate any installation or integration obligations to determine whether those obligations are inconsequential or perfunctory 
in cases where the remaining installation or integration obligation is not determined to be inconsequential or perfunctory  we defer the portion of revenue associated with the fair value of the installation and integration obligation until these services have been completed 
distributors do not have price protection and generally do not have product return rights  except if the product is defective upon shipment or shipped in error  and in some cases upon termination of the distributor agreement 
for certain identified distributors where collection may be contingent on the distributor s resale  revenue recognition is deferred and recognized on a sell through or cash basis 
the determination of whether sales to distributors are contingent on resale is subjective because we must assess the financial wherewithal of the distributor to pay regardless of resale 
for sales to distributors  we consider several factors  including past payment history  where available  trade references  bank account balances  dun bradstreet reports and any other financial information provided by the distributor  in assessing whether the distributor has the financial wherewithal to pay regardless of  or prior to  resale of the product and that collection of the receivable is not contingent on resale 
we offer limited volume price discounts and rebates to certain distributors 
volume price discounts are on a per order basis based on the size of the order and are netted against the revenue recorded at the time of shipment 
we have some arrangements that provide for volume discounts based on meeting certain quarterly or annual purchase levels 
rebates are paid quarterly or annually and are accrued for as incurred 
we consider program management packages and training and other services as separate units of accounting and apply the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf when sold with an aed based on the fact that the items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and could be acquired from another vendor 
fair value is determined to be the price at which they are sold to customers on a stand alone basis 
training revenue is deferred and recognized at the time the training occurs 
aed program management services revenue  pursuant to agreements that exist with some customers pursuant to annual or multi year terms  are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the related contract period 
we offer optional extended service contracts to customers 
fair value is determined to be the price at which they are sold to customers on a stand alone basis 
service contract revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the extended service contracts  which generally begin after the expiration of the original warranty period 
for services performed  other than pursuant to warranty and extended service contract obligations  revenue is recognized when the service is performed and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in february  the fasb issued staff positions no 
and no 
which partially defer the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities and remove certain leasing transactions from its scope 
we will adopt the new requirements beginning in the first quarter of we do not anticipate that this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
under the provisions of sfas  companies may choose to account for eligible financial instruments  warranties and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis 
changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings each reporting period 
sfas is effective for us on january  we have not yet determined if we will elect to apply any of the provisions of sfas  but the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree  including the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination 
the requirements of sfas r are effective for periods beginning after december  we are required to and plan to adopt the provisions of sfas r beginning in the first quarter of we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of sfas r 
the impact will depend upon the acquisitions  if any  we consummate after the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity within the consolidated balance sheets 
the requirements of sfas are effective for periods beginning after december  we are in the process of evaluating this guidance and therefore have not yet determined the impact that sfas will have on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption 
in december  the sec issued sec staff accounting bulletin no 
certain assumptions used in valuation methods sab 
sab extends the use of the simplified method  under certain circumstances  in developing an estimate of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with sfas r 
prior to sab  sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab stated that the simplified method was only available for grants made up to december  sab is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and all interim periods within those fiscal years 
our policy for will be to continue using the simplified method 

table of contents results of operations overview of results revenues for were million  with net income of million 
during the year we posted record revenue of million  representing growth over restructured the us cardiac monitoring sales team to take advantage of revenue opportunities in that market released a new hospital defibrillator in the fourth quarter  marking the beginning of a long term strategic selling alliance with ge medical to distribute these products worldwide introduced new and updated products  including a new cardiac rehabilitation system  an updated electrocardiograph platform  increased connectivity options for stress systems and new non english language versions of a number of products announced the creation of nevada project heartbeat  the first statewide public access defibrillation program in the us renewed its partnership with san diego project heartbeat  where we remain the preferred aed supplier for their leading edge public access defibrillation program expanded global aed distribution  particularly in north america  and achieved significant market share increases received the award for global excellence in ecg monitoring from frost and sullivan settled three intellectual property related lawsuits  eliminating substantial expense  uncertainty and management distraction  and attained record profit and operating cash flow looking forward we expect continued growth in aed revenues  both domestically and overseas in however  we do not expect growth at the same level as we expect to see meaningful revenue from the ge hospital defibrillator  which was released in late we expect our cardiac monitoring line to continue to improve with modest growth over time 
we expect increased service revenue and related gross profit to increase in the foreseeable future 
there are a number of factors that may affect revenue growth in future periods 
these factors include ge s level of success in selling our new hospital defibrillator  the results of our continued effort to revitalize our cardiac monitoring line and our ability to continue to capture share of the international aed market as it rapidly evolves 
we expect continued growth in gross profit as our revenues increase in upcoming quarters 
however  a number of factors will affect our gross margins in the foreseeable future and our gross margins may fluctuate from period to period and over time 
factors that may cause changes in our gross margins from period to period include  but are not limited to  sales volume  product pricing  the mix of sales through our different distribution channels  the timing of the impact of planned productivity increases and cost reductions  and the success of growing sales related to the ge hospital defibrillator 
as revenues increase  we expect our operating expenses to increase  though at a slower rate than our overall revenue rate 
we are devoting substantial resources to the continued development of new versions of our products to meet the changing requirements of our customers 
as a result  our research and development expenses are expected to increase in the future 
in addition  we intend to expand our sales and marketing activities both domestically and internationally in order to increase sales of our products and services 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase as revenue increases and we expand our sales efforts in both domestic and international locations  hire additional marketing personnel and initiate additional marketing programs 
finally  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase slightly in the future as we continue to develop our corporate infrastructure in support of the growth of our business 
in addition to these operating expenses  we expect stock based compensation expense to continue to be a significant ongoing expense 

table of contents revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of our non invasive cardiology products and related consumables  and to a lesser extent  from services related to these products  including training 
we categorize our revenues as defibrillation products  which includes our aeds  hospital defibrillators and related accessories  cardiac monitoring products  which includes capital equipment  software products and related accessories and supplies  and service  which includes service contracts  cpr aed training services  aed program management services  equipment maintenance and repair  replacement part sales and other services 
we derive a portion of our service revenue from sales of separate extended maintenance arrangements 
we defer and recognize these revenues over the applicable maintenance period

domestic defibrillation sales increased by and international sales grew by 
cardiac monitoring products revenue decreased by for from the comparable period in  although revenue for the three months ended december  increased by 
the decrease in our cardiac monitoring revenue is due primarily to increased competition in cardiology equipment and supplies 
service revenue decreased for from the comparable period in due primarily to the discontinuation in the second quarter of of certain non core service contracts acquired in the merger transaction and to a lesser degree to a reduction of product support in some areas  which was done in order to stimulate sales of new products 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  defibrillation products revenue increased for from the comparable period in due mostly to the addition of defibrillation products revenue through the merger transaction on september  defibrillation product revenue increased by approximately over pro forma revenue for the same period in giving effect to the merger transaction as if the two companies had been combined for the entire period  driven by higher sales both internationally and domestically 
cardiac monitoring products revenue decreased by for from the comparable period in this decrease was caused primarily by increased competition and delays in some of our product launches 
service revenue increased for compared to due primarily to the addition of defibrillation related service revenue acquired in the merger transaction 

table of contents gross profit gross profit is revenues less the cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of the costs associated with manufacturing  assembling and testing our products  amortization of certain intangibles  overhead costs  compensation  including stock based compensation and other costs related to manufacturing support and logistics 
we rely on third parties to manufacture certain of our product components 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to these manufacturers 
cost of service revenue consists of customer support costs  training and professional service expenses  parts and compensation 
our hardware products include a warranty period that includes factory repair services or replacement parts 
we accrue estimated expenses for warranty obligations at the time products are shipped

gross profit from service decreased for from the comparable period in due principally to lower revenues on service contracts that were acquired in the merger transaction 
these contracts expired in the first half of year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross profit from products increased for from the comparable period in principally due to the contribution of higher gross profit on sales of aeds after the merger transaction in september increased sales of higher margin cardiac monitoring products in plus product mix changes and productivity improvements in our cardiac monitoring line contributed to higher gross profit as a percent of revenue from products as compared to gross profit from service increased slightly for compared to due principally to the addition of gross profit from defibrillation service revenue  partially offset by the lower gross margins on cardiac monitoring service contracts in resulting from increased costs 
gross margin on service declined significantly from to due mostly to changes in cost structure resulting from the merger transaction 
operating expenses operating expenses include expenses related to research and development  sales  marketing and other general and administrative expenses required to run our business  including stock based compensation 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for development and engineering personnel  fees paid to consultants  and prototype costs related to the design  development  testing and 
table of contents enhancement of products 
several components of our research and development activities require significant funding  the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability in our expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  marketing and sales support functions as well as costs associated with corporate and product branding  promotional and other marketing activities 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  regulatory and human resources personnel as well as professional fees  legal fees  excluding fees associated with significant litigation matters  and other corporate expenses

these investing outflows were partially offset by proceeds from maturities of short term investments of million 
net cash flows used in investing activities in consisted of payments for capital expenditures of million and purchases of short term investments of million  partially offset by proceeds from maturities of short term investments of million and collection of a note receivable related to a royalty agreement acquired in connection with the merger transaction of million 
in addition  net cash flows used in investing activities in included payments of acquisition costs related to the merger transaction of million 
net cash flows provided by financing activities for and consisted of proceeds from exercises of stock options and issuances of common stock under our employment stock purchase plan espp less minimum tax withholdings on restricted stock awards remitted to taxing authorities 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and we had short term investments of million 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and future expected operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet operating expenses  working capital requirements  capital expenditures and other obligations for at least months 
we have a million line of credit with silicon valley bank with minimal restrictions on the amount eligible for borrowing 
substantially all of our current assets are pledged as collateral for the line of credit 
this line of credit bears interest  based on our quarterly adjusted ebitda  at the lender s prime rate or libor plus 
at december   we did not have any borrowings under this line of credit 
we may be affected by economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
for more information on the factors that may impact our financial results  please see part i  item a risk factors included in this annual report on form k 
in addition  we are continually considering other acquisitions that would complement or expand our existing business or that may enable us to expand into new markets 
future acquisitions may require additional debt  equity financing or both 
we may not be able to obtain any additional financing  or may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms 

table of contents contractual obligations the tables below summarize our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  amounts in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations consist of outstanding purchase orders issued in the normal course of business 
at december  we had performance bonds of million outstanding which were collateralized by letters of credit issued by silicon valley bank in connection with various sales contracts or financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the us and sell them worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since the majority of our revenues are currently priced in us dollars and are translated to local currency amounts  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets
