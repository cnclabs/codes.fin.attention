item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview flir was founded in  originally providing infrared imaging systems that were installed on vehicles for use in conducting energy audits 
later  we expanded our focus to other applications and markets for our technology  in particular  designing and selling stabilized thermal imaging systems for aircraft used by law enforcement 
we have since grown substantially  due to increasing demand for infrared products across a growing number of markets  and having executed a series of acquisitions 
today we are one of the world leaders in the design  manufacture and marketing of thermal imaging and stabilized camera systems for a wide variety of applications in the commercial  industrial and government markets  internationally as well as domestically 
our thermography business primarily consists of the design and manufacture of hand held thermal imaging systems that can detect and measure minute temperature differences  which are useful for a wide variety of industrial and commercial applications 
uses for our thermography products include high end predictive and preventative maintenance  research and development  test and measurement  leak detection and scientific analysis 
our thermography products are primarily produced at our facilities in stockholm 
a growing distribution network has enabled us to penetrate existing and emerging markets and applications worldwide 
our commercial vision systems cvs business is focused on the development  manufacture and sale of generally lower cost uncooled products to emerging commercial markets where the primary requirement is to see at night or in adverse conditions 
these markets are developing rapidly and include such uses as automotive night vision  recreational marine  firefighting  airborne law enforcement and commercial security 
cvs also sells camera cores  readout integrated circuits and other sub components to oems in certain markets 
our infrared sensor business  which supplies both internal and external customers  is also part of cvs 
vertical integration into infrared sensors provides us with the ability to design and produce infrared detectors  allowing us to reduce our costs and open new markets 
our cvs products are primarily produced at our santa barbara facility 
our government systems business is focused primarily on markets where very high performance is required 
the primary market for these products is government customers  who use our hand held and fixed mounted products for such applications as force protection  counter terrorism  search and rescue  perimeter security  navigation safety  law enforcement  narcotics detection  maritime and border patrol  and anti piracy 
our government systems products are primarily produced at our portland  boston and stockholm facilities 
a substantial portion of our revenue in the government systems business is derived from sales to government agencies and we are continuing to expand our military program business  both in the us and internationally 
international revenue accounted for approximately percent  percent and  percent of our revenue in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue in the future 
we have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and changing dynamics of foreign competitiveness based on variations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
factors contributing to this variability include significant manufacturing activity in stockholm  significant sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and cross currency fluctuations between such currencies as the us dollar  euro and swedish kroner 
during and  there were significant fluctuations in the values of the major currencies in which we conduct business  in particular  a weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the swedish kroner 
the impact of those fluctuations is reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements  but in the aggregate  did not have a material impact on our results of operations 
we typically experience longer payment cycles on our international sales  which can have an adverse impact upon our liquidity 
in addition  substantial portions of our operations are conducted outside the united states  including manufacturing in stockholm and sales operations worldwide 
international sales and operations may be subject to risks such as the imposition of governmental controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  labor union activities  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  and general economic conditions 

table of contents we experience fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal variations and customer sales cycles  such as the seasonal pattern of contracting by the us and certain foreign governments  the frequent requirement by certain customers to take delivery of equipment prior to the end of december due to funding considerations  and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration 
such events have resulted and could continue to result in certain fluctuations in quarterly results in the future 
as a result of such quarterly fluctuations in operating results  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  goodwill  warranty obligations  contingencies and income taxes on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer at a fixed or determinable price and with a reasonable assurance of collection  passage of title to the customer as indicated by the shipping terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations  pursuant to guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december we design  market and sell our products primarily as commercial  off the shelf products 
many of our government systems and commercial vision systems customers  particularly those who use our airborne systems  request different system configurations  based on standard options or accessories that we offer 
in general  our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based upon customer specified acceptance criteria 
in those limited circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance if we cannot demonstrate that the system meets those specifications prior to shipment 
for any contracts with multiple elements ie  training  installation  additional parts undelivered at the end of a reporting period  we recognize revenue on the delivered elements only after we have determined that the delivered elements have stand alone value and any undelivered elements have objective and reliable evidence of fair value 
in addition  judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also have a limited number of design and development contracts  principally with governmental customers for which revenues and related costs are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events 
table of contents impacting their business  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
actual write offs during the past three years have not been material to our results of operations 
we also record an allowance for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million 
we believe our reported allowances at december   are adequate 
if the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination is made 
inventory 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology infrared systems  we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventories becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to record inventory write downs when conditions exist that suggest that our inventories may be in excess of anticipated demand or are obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventories based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our write downs are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to their net realizable value and establish a new cost basis 
as of december   our inventories of million are stated net of inventory write downs of million 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional inventory write downs may be required in the future 
goodwill 
we have recorded goodwill in connection with our business acquisitions 
we review goodwill in june of each year  or on an interim basis if required  for impairment to determine if events or changes in business conditions indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of the future cash flows we expect the assets to generate within the boundaries of the applicable business divisions of the company 
our current review indicates that no adjustments are necessary for the goodwill assets  which have a carrying value of million as of december  product warranties 
our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time  generally twelve months  at no cost to our customers 
our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
we believe that our recorded liability of million at december  is adequate to cover our future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date 
if actual product failures or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
income taxes 
we record our deferred tax assets when the benefits are more likely than not to be recognized 
valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when a determination is made that the deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized in the future 
in making that determination  on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  we estimate our future taxable income based upon historical operating results and external market data 
future levels of taxable income are dependent upon  but not limited to  general economic conditions  competitive 
table of contents pressures  and other factors beyond our control 
as of december   we have determined that no valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of million is required 
if we should determine that we may be unable to realize our deferred tax assets to the extent reported  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the indicated periods certain items as a percentage of revenue year ended december  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses earnings from operations interest expense interest income other income  net earnings before income taxes income tax provision net earnings years ended december   and revenue 
revenue for totaled million  an increase of percent over the million of revenue in revenue from the thermography business segment increased percent from million in to million in the increase in thermography revenue was primarily due to the introduction of new products and increased unit sales in most of our existing product lines 
revenue from the government systems business segment increased percent from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to significant increases in unit sales of most of our products 
revenue from the commercial vision systems business segment increased percent from million in to million in the increase in commercial vision systems revenue was also primarily due to an increase in unit sales across all major product lines of the segment 
revenue for totaled million  an increase of percent over the million of revenue in revenue from the thermography business segment increased percent from million in to million in the increase in thermography revenue was primarily due to sales of the infracam product which was launched in and increased unit sales in most of our other product lines 
revenue from the government systems business segment increased percent from million in to million in the increase in government systems revenue was primarily due to an increase in sales of gimbaled products  partially offset by a decrease in sales of hand held and fixed mounted products 
revenue from the commercial vision systems business segment increased percent from million in to million in the increase in commercial vision systems revenue was due to increased unit sales across all product lines 
international revenue in totaled million  representing percent of revenue 
this compares with international revenue in which totaled million  representing percent of revenue and 
table of contents million in  representing percent of revenue 
while the sales mix between domestic and international sales may fluctuate slightly from year to year  we anticipate the mix to be approximately percent to percent domestic and percent to percent international on a long term basis 
gross profit 
gross profit in was percent of revenue  compared to percent of revenue in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to cost efficiencies realized by increased volumes in our government systems and commercial vision systems manufacturing facilities 
gross profit in was percent of revenue  compared to percent of revenue in the slight increase in gross profit was primarily due to the product mix within our three business segments and cost efficiencies in our santa barbara operations  offset by stock based compensation expense of million included in our cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes materials  labor and overhead costs incurred in the manufacturing of products and services sold in the period 
material costs include raw materials  purchased components and sub assemblies  outside processing and inbound freight costs 
labor and overhead costs consist of direct and indirect manufacturing costs  including wages and fringe benefits  operating supplies  depreciation  occupancy costs  and purchasing  receiving and inspection costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or percent of revenue  in compared to million  or percent of revenue  in the increase in research and development expenses was due to the continued investment in new product development in all business segments to enable future growth 
we believe that spending levels are sufficient to support the development of new products and the continued growth of the business 
we expect research and development expenses to be approximately percent of revenue on a long term basis 
research and development expenses were million  or percent of revenue  in compared to million  or percent of revenue  in the increase in research and development expenses was due to the growth in the business and the impact of stock based compensation of million in we have also incurred expenses associated with customer funded design and development contracts 
such expenses were million in  million in and million in these expenses are reported as cost of goods sold since the related funding is reported as revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or percent of revenue  in compared to million  or percent of revenue in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to the continued growth in the business  including costs associated with new product launches and increased performance incentive and stock based compensation costs 
in addition  during we incurred significantly higher legal and accounting costs related to the investigation of our historical stock option practices and various other legal matters see note  contingencies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses in the future to increase at a slower rate than revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or percent of revenue  in compared to million  or percent of revenue in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to the growth in the business and the impact of stock based compensation of million in interest expense 
interest expense totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense is primarily attributable to the accrual of interest on the convertible notes that were issued in june  the amortization of costs related to the issuance of the notes and interest on short term borrowings 

table of contents interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in invested cash 
other income  net 
we reported other income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and the other income is primarily currency gains on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our european operations 
income taxes 
our income tax provision was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for  and were percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
the mix in taxable income between our us and foreign operations impacted the income tax provisions in each of these years 
our effective tax rate is lower than the us federal tax rate of percent because of lower foreign tax rates  the effect of foreign tax credits and other federal and state tax credits 
at december   we had us tax net operating loss carryforwards nols totaling approximately million and state tax nols totaling approximately million which expire in the years through additionally  we have federal tax credits available aggregating million and various state tax credits available aggregating million  net of federal benefit  which expire in the years through the utilization of stock option exercise deductions is generally accounted for as a direct increase in additional paid in capital rather than as a reduction in our income tax provision 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes requires that the tax benefits described above be recorded as assets when the benefits are more likely than not to be recognized 
to the extent that we assess the realization of such assets to not be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is required to be recorded 
based on this guidance  we believe that the net deferred tax assets of million reflected on the december  consolidated balance sheet  are realizable based on future forecasts of taxable income over a relatively short time horizon and therefore  we have not recorded a valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to cash provided from operations and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by the acquisition of extech instruments corporation  capital expenditures and repayments of borrowings under our credit agreement 
cash provided by operating activities in totaled million compared to million in the slight increase in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net earnings  offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories and other current assets 
at december   we had accounts receivable in the amount of million compared to million at december  the increase of million in the receivable balance was primarily due to the increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of at december   we had inventories of million compared to million at december  the percent increase in inventories was primarily due to an increase in purchases of materials to support business growth  increased backlog of orders and new product introductions 
at december   we had prepaid expenses and other current assets of million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to estimated tax payments for made to both federal and foreign jurisdictions  increases in vendor advances and increases in sales demonstration units related to recently introduced products 

table of contents accounts payable increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase primarily relates to the increase in inventories and overall company growth 
accrued payroll and related liabilities increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase was primarily due to the timing of payroll payments  increased headcount and increased annual incentive accruals 
accrued income taxes payable decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease relates to prepayments of estimated taxes in foreign jurisdictions that were greater than the expected tax liability in those jurisdictions 
cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  primarily consisting of capital expenditures  principally for expansions and improvements in most of our manufacturing facilities  the purchase of equipment to be utilized in the fabrication of microbolometers at a third party site  costs associated with the continued implementation of an enterprise resource planning system and the acquisition of extech instruments corporation 
cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  primarily consisting of capital expenditures  including the purchase of a facility in orlando  florida  expansions and improvements in our manufacturing facilities and the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system 
on october   we signed a credit agreement credit agreement with bank of america  na  union bank of california  na  na bank national association and other lenders 
the credit agreement provides for a million  five year revolving line of credit 
we have the right  subject to certain conditions including approval of additional commitments by qualified lenders  to increase the line of credit by an additional million until october  the credit agreement includes a million sublimit multicurrency option  permitting us and certain of our designated subsidiaries to borrow in euro  kroner  sterling and other agreed upon currencies 
under the credit agreement  borrowings will bear interest based upon the prime lending rate of the bank of america or eurodollar rates with a provision for a spread over eurodollar rates based upon the company s leverage ratio 
the eurodollar interest rate was percent and the prime lending rate was percent at december  these rates were percent and percent  respectively  at december  the credit agreement requires us to pay a commitment fee on the amount of unused credit at a rate  based on our leverage ratio  which ranges from percent to percent 
at december  and  the commitment fee rate was percent 
the credit agreement contains five financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain leverage ratios  in addition to minimum levels of ebitda and consolidated net worth  a maximum level of capital expenditures and  commencing december   a minimum liquidity of cash and availability under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all assets of the company 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  outstanding under the credit agreement and were in compliance with all of the financial covenants 
we had million and million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement at december  and  respectively  which reduces the total available credit 
our sweden subsidiary has a million swedish kroner approximately million line of credit with an interest rate at percent at december  at december   the company had no amounts outstanding on this line of credit 
the million swedish kroner line of credit is secured primarily by accounts receivable and inventories of the sweden subsidiary and is subject to automatic renewal on an annual basis 
in june  we issued million of percent senior convertible notes due in in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the net proceeds from the issuance were approximately million 
issuance costs are being amortized over a period of seven years 
interest is payable semiannually on june and december of each year 
the holders of the notes may convert all or some of their notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes prior to the maturity date in certain circumstances 
we may redeem for cash all or part of the notes on or after june  
table of contents the convertible notes are eligible for conversion at the option of the note holders 
as of december   notes with a value of  have been converted into shares of the company s common stock 
we do not currently anticipate any more conversions of these notes before we believe that our existing cash combined with the cash we anticipate to generate from operating activities  and our available credit facilities and financing available from other sources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
we do not have any significant commitments nor are we aware of any significant events or conditions that are likely to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we leased our non owned facilities under operating lease agreements 
we also leased certain operating machinery and equipment and office equipment under operating lease agreements 
except for these operating lease agreements  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest on long term debt credit agreement interest on credit agreement operating leases licensing rights post retirement obligations principal and interest obligations on our long term debt are based upon the assumption that all convertible notes are held to their maturity in post retirement obligations are based upon actuarial assumptions 
actual payments may differ in terms of both timing and amounts 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit agreements 
the credit agreements are at variable rates 
a change in interest rates on the credit agreements impacts the interest incurred and cash flows 
at december   we had million outstanding under our credit agreement 
it is currently our intention to repay the million outstanding in full by the end of the first quarter of we have determined that any change in interest rates during the first three months of will not materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 
our convertible notes carry interest at a fixed rate of percent 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes impact the fair value of the notes but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
the fair value of the notes at december   was approximately million compared to a carrying value of million 
we have assets  liabilities  and inventory purchase commitments outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
similarly  certain revenues from products sold in foreign countries are denominated in foreign currencies 
assets and liabilities located outside the united states are primarily located in sweden and the united kingdom 
our investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar are considered long term 
we do not currently engage in forward currency exchange contracts or similar hedging activities to reduce our economic exposure to changes in exchange rates 
because we market  sell and license our products throughout the world  we could be adversely affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our products 
our net investment in foreign subsidiaries  translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates at december  was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the potential loss in fair value is primarily due to the increase in the net investment of foreign subsidiaries 
the company has no plans of liquidating any of its foreign subsidiaries  and therefore  foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not reduce our reported net earnings
