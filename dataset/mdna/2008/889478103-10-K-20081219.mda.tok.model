item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on december   we issued a press release and held a conference call to review the results of operations for our fiscal year ended october  and to discuss the current state of our business 
the information and estimates contained in this report are consistent with those given in the press release and on the conference call on december   and we are not reconfirming or updating that information 
overview in fiscal  we recognized billion of revenues and recorded a net loss of million  compared to billion of revenues and million of net income in fiscal the loss recognized in fiscal  as compared to the income recognized in fiscal  was due primarily to the higher inventory impairment charges and write offs and joint venture impairment charges recognized in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  a decline in revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and the negative impact on profit margins due to the higher sales incentives given on the homes delivered in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset in part by the positive impact on cost of sales on homes settled in fiscal from communities that had reduced inventory values as a result of impairments previously recognized 
we recognized inventory impairment charges and write offs  joint venture impairment charges and goodwill impairment charges of million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal cost of sales was reduced by approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  due to reduced inventory values as a result of impairments previously recognized 
the value of net new contracts signed declined by in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decrease in the value of net new contracts signed was the result of a decrease in the number of net new contracts signed and a decline in the average value of the contracts signed 
when we report the number and value of net new contracts signed  we report such totals net of any cancellations that occur during the reporting period  whether signed in that reporting period or in a prior period 
the decrease in the number of net new contracts signed was due to the slowdown in our business discussed below 
the decrease in the average value of contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to higher sales incentives given to home buyers in fiscal  as compared to fiscal and a shift in the number of contracts signed to less expensive areas and or products in fiscal  as compared to fiscal during fiscal  our customers cancelled contracts with an aggregate sales value of million  as compared to  cancelled contracts with an aggregate sales value of billion in fiscal in fiscal and  these cancellations represented and  respectively  of the gross number of contracts signed  and and  respectively  of the gross value of contracts signed 
our backlog at october  of billion decreased  as compared to our backlog at october  of billion 
backlog consists of homes under contract but not yet delivered to our home buyers for our communities accounted for using the completed contract method of accounting 
only outstanding agreements of sale that have been signed by both the home buyer and us as of the end of the period for which we are reporting are included in backlog 
of the value of backlog reported on october   and  home buyers subsequently cancelled approximately 
and  respectively 
since the fourth quarter of fiscal  we have experienced a slowdown in our business 
this slowdown has worsened over the past several months 
the value of net new contracts signed in fiscal is lower than the value of contracts signed in fiscal this slowdown  which we believe started with a decline in consumer confidence  an overall softening of demand for new homes and an oversupply of homes available for sale  has been exacerbated by  among other things  a decline in the overall economy  increasing unemployment  fear of job loss  a significant decline in the securities markets  the continuing decline in home prices  the large number of homes that are or will be available due to foreclosures  the inability of some of our home buyers to sell their current home  the deterioration in the credit markets  and the direct and indirect impact of the turmoil in the mortgage loan market 
we believe that the key to a recovery in our business is the return of consumer confidence and a stabilization of financial markets and home prices 
we continue to seek a balance between our short term goal of selling homes in a tough market and our long term goal of maximizing the value of our communities 
we believe that many of our communities are in locations that are difficult to replace and in markets where approvals have been increasingly difficult to achieve 
we believe 
table of contents that many of these communities have substantial embedded value that will be realizable in the future and that this value should not necessarily be sacrificed in the current soft market 
we are concerned about the dislocation in the secondary mortgage market 
we maintain relationships with a widely diversified group of mortgage financial institutions  most of which are among the largest and  we believe  most reliable in the industry 
our buyers generally have been able to obtain adequate financing 
nevertheless  tightening credit standards have shrunk the pool of potential home buyers and the availability of certain loan products previously available to our home buyers 
mortgage market liquidity issues and higher borrowing rates may impede some of our home buyers from closing  while others may find it more difficult to sell their existing homes as their prospective buyers face the problem of obtaining a mortgage 
we believe that our home buyers generally should be able to continue to secure mortgages  due to their typically lower loan to value ratios and attractive credit profiles  as compared to the average home buyer 
because we cannot predict the short and long term liquidity of the credit markets  we continue to caution that  with the uncertainties in these markets  the pace of home sales could slow further until these markets stabilize 
based on our experience during prior downturns in the housing market  we believe that unexpected opportunities may arise in difficult times for those builders that are well prepared 
in the current challenging environment  we believe our strong balance sheet  liquidity and access to capital  our broad geographic presence  our diversified product lines  our experienced personnel and our national brand name all position us well for such opportunities now and in the future 
at october   we had billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand and approximately billion available under our revolving credit facility which extends to we believe we have the resources available to fund attractive opportunities  should they arise 
when our industry recovers  we believe that we will see reduced competition from the small and mid sized private builders who are our primary competitors in the luxury market 
we believe that the access of these private builders to capital already appears to be severely constrained 
we envision that there will be fewer and more selective lenders serving our industry at that time 
those lenders likely will gravitate to the home building companies that offer them the greatest security  the strongest balance sheets and the broadest array of potential business opportunities 
we believe that this reduced competition  combined with attractive long term demographics  will reward those well capitalized builders who can persevere through the current challenging environment 
notwithstanding the current market conditions  we believe that geographic and product diversification  access to lower cost capital  and strong demographics have in the past and will in the future  as market conditions improve over time  benefit those builders that can control land and persevere through the increasingly difficult regulatory approval process 
we believe that these factors favor the large publicly traded home building companies with the capital and expertise to control home sites and gain market share 
we believe that  as builders reduce the number of home sites being taken through the approval process and this process continues to become more difficult  and if the political pressure from no growth proponents continues to increase  our expertise in taking land through the approval process and our already approved land positions will allow us to grow in the years to come  as market conditions improve 
because of the length of time that it takes to obtain the necessary approvals on a property  complete the land improvements on it  and deliver a home after a home buyer signs an agreement of sale  we are subject to many risks 
we attempt to reduce certain risks by controlling land for future development through options also referred to herein as land purchase contracts  contracts  purchase agreements or option agreements whenever we can  thus allowing the necessary governmental approvals to be obtained before acquiring title to the land  generally commencing construction of a detached home only after executing an agreement of sale and receiving a substantial down payment from the buyer  and using subcontractors to perform home construction and land development work on a fixed price basis 
our risk reduction strategy of generally not commencing the construction of a home until we had an agreement of sale with a buyer was effective in the past  but due to the significant number of cancellations of agreements of sale  that we have had in the current downturn in the housing market  many of which were for homes on which we had commenced construction  and the increase in the number of multi family communities that we have under construction  the number of homes under construction for which we do not have an agreement of sale has increased from our historical levels 

table of contents in response to current market conditions  we have been reevaluating and renegotiating or canceling many of our land purchase contracts 
as a result  we have reduced our land position from a high of approximately  home sites at april   to approximately  home sites at october  of the  home sites that we controlled at october   we owned approximately  of them 
of the  home sites owned at october   significant improvements have been completed on approximately  of them 
at october   we were selling from communities compared to communities at october  we expect to be selling from approximately communities at october  given the current business climate in which we are operating and the numerous uncertainties related to sales paces  sales prices  mortgage markets  cancellations  market direction and the potential for and magnitude of future impairments  it is difficult to provide guidance for fiscal subject to our caveats and risks reported elsewhere and the preceding caveats  we currently estimate that we will deliver between  and  homes in fiscal at an average sales price of between  and  per home 
we believe that  as a result of continuing sales incentives given to our home buyers and slower sales per community  our cost of sales as a percentage of revenues  before impairment charges and write downs  will be higher in fiscal than in fiscal additionally  based on fiscal s lower projected revenues  our selling  general and administrative expenses  which we expect to be lower in fiscal than in fiscal  will be higher as a percentage of revenues 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or fair value  as determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
in addition to direct land acquisition  land development and home construction costs  costs also include interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead related to development and construction  which are capitalized to inventory during the period beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction 
for those communities that have been temporarily closed  no additional interest is allocated to the community s inventory until it re opens and other carrying costs are expensed as incurred 
once a parcel of land has been approved for development and we open the community  it may take four to five years to fully develop  sell and deliver all the homes in one of our typical communities 
longer or shorter time periods are possible depending on the number of home sites in a community and the sales and delivery pace of the homes in a community 
our master planned communities  consisting of several smaller communities  may take up to ten years or more to complete 
because of the downturn in our business  the aforementioned estimated community lives will likely be significantly longer 
because our inventory is considered a long lived asset under us generally accepted accounting principles  we are required  under sfas  to regularly review the carrying value of each of our communities and write down the value of those communities for which we believe the values are not recoverable 
current communities when the profitability of a current community deteriorates  the sales pace declines significantly or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset  the asset is reviewed for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flow for the community to its carrying value 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flow is less than the community s carrying value  the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is primarily determined by discounting the estimated future cash flow of each community 
the impairment is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the impairment is determined 
in estimating the future undiscounted cash flow of a community  we use various estimates such as a the expected sales pace in a community  based upon general economic conditions that will have a short term or long term impact on the market in which the community is located and on competition within the market  including the number of home sites available and pricing and incentives being offered in other communities owned by us or by other builders  b the expected sales prices and sales incentives to be offered in a community  c costs expended to date and expected to be incurred in the future  including  but not limited to  land and land development costs  home construction costs  interest costs and overhead costs  d alternative product 
table of contents offerings that may be offered in a community that will have an impact on sales pace  sales price  building cost or the number of homes that can be built on a particular site  and e alternative uses for the property such as the possibility of a sale of the entire community to another builder or the sale of individual home sites 
future communities we evaluate all land held for future communities or future sections of current communities  whether owned or under contract  to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land as originally contemplated 
this evaluation encompasses the same types of estimates used for current communities described above  as well as an evaluation of the regulatory environment in which the land is located and the estimated probability of obtaining the necessary approvals  the estimated time and cost it will take to obtain the approvals and the possible concessions that will be required to be given in order to obtain the approvals 
concessions may include cash payments to fund improvements to public places such as parks and streets  dedication of a portion of the property for use by the public or as open space or a reduction in the density or size of the homes to be built 
based upon this review  we decide a as to land under contract to be purchased  whether the contract will likely be terminated or renegotiated  and b as to land we own  whether the land will likely be developed as contemplated or in an alternative manner  or should be sold 
we then further determine whether costs that have been capitalized to the community are recoverable or should be written off 
the write off is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the need for the write off is determined 
the estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of both current and future communities are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions 
should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated fair value deteriorate in the future  we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges and write offs related to current and future communities 
variable interest entities we have a significant number of land purchase contracts and several investments in unconsolidated entities which we evaluate in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 as amended by fasb interpretation no 
r collectively referred to as fin 
pursuant to fin  an enterprise that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the expected residual returns of a variable interest entity vie is considered to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
a vie is an entity with insufficient equity investment or in which the equity investors lack some of the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
for land purchase contracts with sellers meeting the definition of a vie  we perform a review to determine which party is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
this review requires substantial judgment and estimation 
these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the entity s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of the land under contract 
at october   we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of two vies related to land purchase contracts and had recorded million of inventory and million of accrued expenses 
revenue and cost recognition home sales completed contract method the construction time of our homes is generally less than one year  although some homes may take more than one year to complete 
revenues and cost of revenues from these home sales are recorded at the time each home is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer 
closing normally occurs shortly after construction is substantially completed 
in addition  we have several high rise mid rise projects which do not qualify for percentage of completion accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas  which are included in this category of revenues and costs 
for our standard attached and detached homes  land  land development and related costs  both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future  are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes to be constructed in each community 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
the estimated land  common area development and related costs of master planned communities  including the cost of golf courses  net of their estimated residual 
table of contents value  are allocated to individual communities within a master planned community on a relative sales value basis 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs are allocated to the remaining home sites in each of the communities of the master planned community 
for high rise mid rise projects that do not qualify for percentage of completion accounting  land  land development  construction and related costs  both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future  are generally amortized to the cost of units closed based upon an estimated relative sales value of the units closed to the total estimated sales value 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated total costs or revenues of the project are allocated to the remaining units to be delivered 
forfeited customer deposits are recognized in other income in the period in which we determine that the customer will not complete the purchase of the home and when we determine that we have the right to retain the deposit 
home sales percentage of completion method during the past two years  we completed construction on four projects for which we used the percentage of completion accounting method to recognize revenues and costs  the remaining units in these projects will be accounted for using the completed contract method of accounting 
based upon the current accounting rules and interpretations  we do not believe that any of our current or future communities qualify for percentage of completion accounting 
under the provisions of sfas  revenues and costs are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting for those communities that qualify when construction is beyond the preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for non delivery of the unit  sufficient units in the project have been sold to ensure that the property will not be converted to rental property  the sales proceeds are collectible and the aggregate sales proceeds and the total cost of the project can be reasonably estimated 
revenues and costs of individual projects are recognized on the individual project s aggregate value of units for which the home buyers have signed binding agreements of sale  less an allowance for cancellations  and are based on the percentage of total estimated construction costs that have been incurred 
total estimated revenues and costs are reviewed periodically  and any change is applied to current and future periods 
forfeited customer deposits are recognized as a reduction in the amount of revenues reversed in the period in which we determine that the customer will not complete the purchase of the home and when we determine that we have the right to retain the deposit 
sales incentives in order to promote sales of our homes  we grant our home buyers sales incentives from time to time 
these incentives will vary by type of incentive and by amount on a community by community and home by home basis 
incentives that impact the value of the home or the sales price paid  such as special or additional options  are generally reflected as a reduction in sales revenues 
incentives that we pay to an outside party  such as paying some or all of a home buyer s closing costs are recorded as an additional cost of revenues 
incentives are recognized at the time the home is delivered to the home buyer and we receive the sales proceeds 
land sales land sales revenues and cost of revenues are recorded at the time that title and possession of the property have been transferred to the buyer 
we recognize the pro rata share of land sales revenues and cost of land sales revenues to entities in which we have a or less interest based upon the ownership percentage attributable to the non company partners 
any profit not recognized in a transaction reduces our investment in the entity or is recorded as an accrued expense on our consolidated balance sheets 
off balance sheet arrangements we have investments in and advances to various joint ventures and to toll brothers realty trust group trust and toll brothers realty trust group ii trust ii 
at october   we had investments in and advances to these entities of million  and were committed to invest or advance additional funds to these entities if needed and had guaranteed several of these entities indebtedness and or loan commitments 
see note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities for more information regarding these entities 
our investments in these entities are accounted for using the equity method 

table of contents results of operations the following table compares certain statement of operations items related to fiscal  and amounts in millions year ended october  revenues completed contract percentage of completion land sales costs of revenues completed contract percentage of completion land sales interest selling  general and administrative goodwill impairment loss income from operations loss earnings from unconsolidated entities interest and other loss income before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss income note percentages for cost of revenues for completed contract  percentage of completion and land sales are based on the corresponding item under revenues 
percentages for interest expense and selling  general and administrative expenses are based on total revenues 
amounts may not add due to rounding 
fiscal compared to fiscal unless otherwise stated  contracts signed represents a number or amount equal to the gross number or amount of contracts signed during the relevant period  less the number or amount of contracts cancelled during the relevant period  which includes contracts that were signed during the relevant period and contracts signed in prior periods 
revenues and costs completed contract revenues in fiscal were lower than those for fiscal by billion  or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of homes delivered and a decrease in the average price of the homes delivered 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered was primarily due to the lower backlog of homes at october  as compared to october  this lower backlog of homes was primarily the result of a decrease in the number of net new contracts signed in fiscal over fiscal the decline in the average price of the homes delivered in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to higher sales incentives given on homes closed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  which was offset by the settlement of units in several of our higher priced high rise projects not accounted for under the percentage of completion accounting method in fiscal that did not have settlements in fiscal  and a shift in product mix during fiscal to higher priced product 
sales incentives given on homes delivered in fiscal averaged  per home  as compared to  per home in fiscal the aggregate value of net new sales contracts signed decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the value of net new sales contracts signed was billion  homes in fiscal and billion  homes in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was the result of a decrease in the number of net new contracts 
table of contents signed and a decrease in the average value of each contract signed 
we believe the decrease in the number of new contracts signed was attributable to the overall softening of demand for new homes 
see overview above for an expanded discussion related to the decrease in the number of signed contracts and the slowdown in our business 
the decrease in the average value of net new contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to higher sales incentives given to home buyers in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and a shift in the number of contracts signed to less expensive areas and or products in fiscal  as compared to fiscal at october   we were offering sales incentives that averaged approximately of the sales price of the home  as compared to an average of approximately at october  at october   our backlog of homes under contract was billion  homes  lower than our billion  homes backlog at october  the decrease in backlog at october  compared to our backlog at october  was primarily attributable to a lower backlog at october   as compared to the backlog at october   and the decrease in the value and number of net new contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset in part by lower deliveries in fiscal  as compared to fiscal home costs  including inventory impairment charges and write offs but before interest  as a percentage of home sales revenue were in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal in fiscal and  we recognized inventory impairment charges and write offs of million and million  respectively 
excluding inventory impairment charges and write offs  cost of revenues was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the increase in the cost of revenues percentage before inventory impairment charges and write offs was due primarily to higher sales incentives on the homes delivered and higher overhead costs per home due to decreased construction activity  offset in part by the positive impact on cost of sales on homes settled in fiscal from communities that had reduced inventory values as a result of impairments previously recognized 
revenues and costs percentage of completion in fiscal and  we recognized million and million of revenues  respectively  and million and million of costs excluding interest  respectively  on projects accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
this decline in revenues in fiscal was primarily the result of the delivery of available units to be sold in projects accounted for using the percentage of completion method and the lack of new projects that qualify under the accounting rules for the application of the percentage of completion accounting method 
during the past two years  we completed construction on four projects for which we used the percentage of completion accounting method to recognize revenues and costs  the remaining units in these projects will be accounted for using the completed contract method of accounting 
based upon the current accounting rules and interpretations  we do not believe that any of our current or future communities qualify for the percentage of completion accounting method 
revenues and costs land sales we are developing several communities in which we expect to sell a portion of the land to other builders or unrelated entities 
the amount and profitability of land sales will vary from year to year depending upon the sale and delivery of the specific land parcels 
in fiscal and  we recognized million and million of land sales revenues  respectively  and million and million of costs excluding interest  respectively 
interest expense in our homebuilding operations that are accounted for using the completed contract method of accounting  we determine interest expense on a specific lot by lot basis  and for land sales  on a parcel by parcel basis 
as a percentage of total revenues  interest expense varies depending on many factors  including the period of time that we owned the land  the length of time that the homes delivered during the period were under construction  and the interest rates and the amount of debt carried by us in proportion to the amount of our inventory during those periods 
for projects that used the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition  we determined interest expense based on the total estimated interest for the project and the percentage of total estimated construction costs that had been incurred 
any change in the estimated interest expense for the project was applied to current and future periods from the date the estimate was made 
interest expense as a percentage of revenues was of total revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the increase in interest expense as a percentage of revenues in fiscal was due to the added length of 
table of contents time that the homes delivered in fiscal remained in inventory and accumulated additional capitalized interest 
in addition  as our inventory has been reduced  there is less available inventory to which we allocate the interest incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of revenues  sg a was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal sg a spending decreased by million  or  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the reduction in spending was due primarily to reduced compensation costs and reduced costs for advertising  promotions and marketing 
goodwill impairment during fiscal  due to the continued decline of the nevada and florida housing markets  we re evaluated the carrying value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of two small home builders in these markets 
during fiscal  due to the continued decline of the detroit housing market  we re evaluated the carrying value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of a small home builder 
we estimated the fair value of our assets in these markets  including goodwill 
fair value was determined based on the discounted future cash flow expected to be generated in these markets 
based upon this evaluation and our expectation that these markets would not recover for a number of years  we determined that the related goodwill had been impaired 
we recognized million and million of impairment charges in fiscal and  respectively 
after recognizing these charges  we do not have any goodwill remaining on our balance sheet at october  losses from unconsolidated entities we are a participant in several joint ventures and in the trust and trust ii 
we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from these entities 
many of our joint ventures are land development projects or high rise mid rise construction projects and do not generate revenues and earnings for a number of years during the development of the property 
once development is complete  the joint ventures generally  over a relatively short period of time  are expected to generate revenues and earnings until all the assets of the entities are sold 
because there is not a steady flow of revenues and earnings from these entities  the operating results recognized from these entities will vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
in fiscal  we recognized million of losses from unconsolidated entities as compared to million of losses in fiscal the loss in fiscal was the result of million of impairment charges related to seven of our investments in unconsolidated entities 
the loss in fiscal was attributable to million of impairment charges related to two of our investments in unconsolidated entities 
interest and other income for fiscal and  interest and other income was million and million  respectively 
the increase in other income in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the recognition in fiscal of a gain of million related to the receipt of proceeds from a condemnation judgment in the company s favor  and higher interest income  offset  in part  by million of gains from the sales of our cable tv and broadband internet businesses and our security monitoring business  higher retained customer deposits  higher income from ancillary businesses and higher management fees in fiscal loss income before income taxes for fiscal  we reported a loss before income tax benefits of million  as compared to million of income before income taxes for fiscal income taxes in fiscal  an income tax benefit was provided at an effective rate of 
in fiscal  an income tax provision was provided at an effective rate of 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and are not comparable because of the impact of the individual components that comprise the benefit for income taxes that was recognized in fiscal related to our reported loss in fiscal and the impact of the individual components that 
table of contents comprise the provision for income taxes that was recognized in fiscal related to our reported income in fiscal see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  income taxes  for additional information regarding the change in the income tax rates and the impact on the financial statements 
geographic segments we operate in four geographic segments around the united states the north  consisting of connecticut  illinois  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  new jersey  new york  and rhode island  the mid atlantic  consisting of delaware  maryland  pennsylvania  virginia and west virginia  the south  consisting of florida  georgia  north carolina  south carolina  and texas  and the west  consisting of arizona  california  colorado and nevada 
we acquired and opened our first communities for sale in georgia in fiscal we stopped selling homes in rhode island in the first quarter of fiscal and delivered our last home there in fiscal our operations in rhode island were immaterial to the north geographic segment 
the following table summarizes by geographic segment total revenues and loss income before income taxes for each of the years ended october  and amounts in millions loss income before revenues income taxes units units north a mid atlantic b south c west d corporate and other total a includes percentage of completion revenues of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and land revenues of million and million in fiscal and  respectively

c includes percentage of completion revenues of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and land revenues of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
d includes land revenues of million in fiscal north revenues in fiscal were lower than those in fiscal by million  or 
the decrease in revenues was attributable to a decrease of million in percentage of completion revenues and an decrease in the number of homes delivered  partially offset by a increase in the average price of homes delivered 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered in the year ended october   as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to lower backlog at october   as compared to october  the decline in backlog at october   as compared to october   was due primarily to an decrease in the number of new contracts signed in fiscal over fiscal the increase in the average price of homes delivered in the year ended october   as compared to the year ended october   was primarily due to closings during fiscal in several high rise completed contract communities in the new york and new jersey urban markets  which had higher average prices than our typical product  we did not have any closings of this type of product in fiscal excluding these deliveries  the average price of homes delivered in fiscal decreased  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher sales incentives and a shift in the number of settlements to less expensive products and or locations in fiscal the value of net new contracts signed during the year ended october  was million  a decline  from the billion of net new contracts signed during the year ended october  the decline in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to a decrease in the number of net new contracts signed and a decrease in the average value of each contract 
the decrease in the number of net new contracts signed in fiscal 
table of contents was primarily due to the continued slowdown in the housing market 
the decline in the average sales price was primarily the result of fewer net new contracts signed in the new york and new jersey urban markets  which had higher average prices than our typical product  as several communities in these areas sold out in fiscal  higher sales incentives given during the year ended october   as compared to the year ended october   and a shift in the number of contracts signed to less expensive product in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the number of contract cancellations for the year ended october   was  as compared to in the year ended october  we reported million of income before income taxes in the year ended october   as compared to income before income taxes of million in the year ended october  the decrease in income was due to a million loss from unconsolidated entities in fiscal  as compared to million of income in fiscal  and lower revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset  in part by the recognition of a million charge for goodwill impairment in the first quarter of fiscal  and lower selling  general and administrative costs and lower costs of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the loss from unconsolidated entities includes million of impairment charges in fiscal related to two of these unconsolidated entities 
the lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in the year ended october   as compared to the year ended october   was primarily the result of lower inventory impairment charges recognized in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded million of inventory impairments  as compared to million in fiscal mid atlantic revenues in fiscal were lower than those in fiscal by million  or 
the decrease in revenues for the year ended october  was attributable to a decrease in the number of homes delivered primarily in virginia and pennsylvania  and a decrease in the average sales price of the homes delivered 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered in fiscal was primarily due to a lower backlog at october   as compared to october  the decrease in the backlog of homes at october  was primarily the result of a decrease in the number of net new contracts signed in fiscal over fiscal the decrease in the average price of the homes delivered in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to higher sales incentives given in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the value of net new contracts signed during fiscal of million decreased from the million of net new contracts signed in fiscal the decline was due to a decrease in the number of net new contracts signed and a decrease in the average value of each contract 
the decrease in the number of net new contracts signed was due primarily to continued weak demand  partially offset by lower cancellations for the year ended october   as compared to the year ended october  the number of contract cancellations decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in the average value of each contract was primarily attributable to higher sales incentives given in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and a shift in the number of contracts signed to less expensive products in maryland and virginia in fiscal  as compared to fiscal we reported a loss before income taxes of million for the year ended october   as compared to income before income taxes of million for the year ended october  this decline was primarily due to a decline in revenues and higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
for fiscal  cost of revenues before interest as a percentage of revenues was  as compared to in fiscal the increase in the fiscal percentage was primarily the result of the higher inventory impairment charges recognized and increased sales incentives given to home buyers on the homes delivered 
we recognized inventory impairment charges of million in the year ended october   as compared to million in the year ended october  as a percentage of revenues  higher sales incentives increased cost of revenues approximately in fiscal  as compared to fiscal

the decrease in revenues was attributable to a decrease in the number of homes delivered  a decrease in the average selling price of the homes delivered  and a reduction in percentage of completion revenues of million 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered was primarily attributable to our florida operations  where we had a lower number of homes in backlog at october   as compared to october  the decrease in the backlog of homes at october  for the entire segment was primarily the result of a decrease in the number of net new contracts signed in fiscal over fiscal the decrease in the average price of the homes delivered in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to higher sales incentives given to home buyers and a greater percentage of this segment s settlements shifting to less expensive areas  primarily in florida 
the value of net new contracts signed in fiscal was million  a decline from the million of net new contracts signed in fiscal the decline was due to a decrease in the number of net new contracts signed and a decrease in the average value of each contract 
the decrease in the number of net new contracts signed was attributable to the overall continued weak market conditions in north carolina  south carolina and texas

the decrease in the average value of each contract signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  for this geographic segment was primarily due to lower average sales prices in florida  which was the result of higher sales incentives and a shift in the number of contracts signed to less expensive areas and products in fiscal  as compared to fiscal in addition  the average value of each contract signed in florida for the year ended october  was negatively impacted by cancellations at high rise projects in fiscal  which carried a higher average value per cancelled contract 
the decreases in florida s average value of each contract signed were offset  in part  by an increase in the average value of contracts signed in north carolina  which was primarily due to a shift in the number of contracts signed to more expensive products in fiscal  as compared to fiscal we reported losses before income taxes for the years ended october  and  of million and million  respectively 
the increase in the loss was primarily due to a decline in revenues and higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  partially offset by lower selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal  as compared to fiscal cost of revenues before interest as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended october   as compared to in fiscal the increase in the fiscal percentage was primarily due to the higher inventory impairment charges recognized as well as increased sales incentives given to home buyers on the homes delivered during fiscal  as compared to fiscal for the years ended october  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of inventory impairments

we reported losses before income taxes for the years ended october  and  of million and million  respectively 
the increase in the loss was attributable to lower revenues and higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and an increase in impairment charges related to unconsolidated entities in which we have investments from million in fiscal to million in fiscal for the years ended october  and  cost of revenues before interest as a percentage of revenues was and  respectively 
the increase in the fiscal percentages was primarily the result of increased sales incentives given to home buyers on the homes delivered and higher inventory impairment charges as a percentage of revenues  partially  offset by the positive impact on the cost of sales percentage on homes settled in fiscal from communities that had reduced inventory values as a result of impairments previously recognized 
as a percentage of revenues  higher sales incentives increased cost of revenues approximately in fiscal  as compared to fiscal we recognized inventory impairment charges of million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal this segment benefited from the recognition of million of income in fiscal related to the receipt of proceeds from a favorable condemnation judgment on property we controlled in this segment 
corporate and other corporate and other realized a loss before income taxes for the year ended october  of million  an increase of million from the million loss before income taxes reported for the year ended october  this increase was primarily the result of a million gain realized from the sale of our cable tv and broadband internet business and security business in fiscal and lower management fee income in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  partially offset by higher interest income and lower corporate general and administrative expenses in fiscal  as compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues and costs completed contract revenues for fiscal were lower than those of fiscal by approximately billion  or 
the decrease was attributable to a decrease in the number of homes delivered and a decrease in the average price of the homes delivered 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered was primarily due to the lower backlog of homes at october  as compared to october   which was primarily the result of a decrease in the number of contracts signed in fiscal versus fiscal  and a decline of in the number of contracts signed in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in the average price of the homes delivered was due primarily to the increased sales incentives given to buyers on the homes delivered in fiscal as compared to fiscal offset in part by a slight change in the mix of homes delivered to higher priced homes 
the value of contracts signed in fiscal was billion  homes 
this represented a decrease compared to the value of contracts signed in fiscal of billion  homes 
the decrease was attributable to a decrease in the number of contracts signed in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and a decrease in the average value of each contract signed in fiscal as compared to fiscal we believe the decrease in the number of contracts signed was attributable to the increased number of cancellations  a decline in consumer confidence  an overall softening of demand for new homes and an oversupply of homes available for sale 
the value of contracts cancelled in fiscal including those signed in fiscal and those signed in prior periods but not cancelled until fiscal as a percentage of the gross value of contracts signed in fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal we believe this slowdown was attributable to a decline in consumer confidence  an overall softening of demand for new homes  an oversupply of homes available for sale  the inability of some of our home buyers to sell their current home and the direct and indirect impact of the turmoil in the mortgage loan market 
we attributed the reduction in demand to concerns on the part of prospective home buyers about the direction of home prices  due in part to the constant media attention with regard to the potential of mortgage foreclosures  many home builders 
table of contents advertising price reductions and increased sales incentives  and concerns by prospective home buyers about being able to sell their existing homes 
in addition  we believed speculators and buyers who bought homes as an investment were no longer helping to fuel demand 
we tried to avoid selling homes to speculators  and we generally did not build detached homes without having a signed agreement of sale and receiving a substantial down payment from a buyer 
nonetheless  we were impacted by an overall increase in the supply of homes available for sale in many markets  as speculators attempted to sell the homes they previously purchased or cancelled contracts for homes under construction  and as those builders that as part of their business strategy were building homes in anticipation of capturing additional sales in a demand driven market  attempted to reduce their inventories by lowering prices and adding incentives 
in addition  based on the high cancellation rates reported by us and by other builders  non speculative buyer cancellations were also adding to the supply of homes in the marketplace 
the decline in the average sales price of new sales contracts signed was due primarily to a shift in the number of contracts signed to less expensive areas and or smaller homes and the effect of increased sales incentives in fiscal  as compared to fiscal at october   our backlog of homes under contract accounted for under the completed contract method of accounting was billion  homes  lower than the billion  homes in backlog at october  the decrease in backlog at october   as compared to the backlog at october   was primarily attributable to a lower backlog at october   as compared to the backlog at october   and the decrease in the value and number of contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset in part by the lower number of deliveries in fiscal  as compared to fiscal home costs as a percentage of revenue were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in the fiscal percentage was primarily the result of the higher amount of inventory impairment charges recognized  increased sales incentives given to home buyers on the homes delivered and higher overhead costs per home delivered 
in fiscal and  we recognized inventory impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
fiscal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased by approximately due to the increased sales incentives and by due to higher overhead costs per home 
revenues and costs percentage of completion we were developing several projects for which we recognized revenues and costs using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenues and costs of individual projects were recognized on the individual project s aggregate value of units for which home buyers had signed binding agreements of sale and were based on the percentage of total estimated construction costs that had been incurred 
total estimated revenues and construction costs were reviewed periodically  and any changes were applied to current and future periods 
in fiscal and  we recognized million and million of revenues  respectively  and million and million of costs  respectively  on these projects 
in fiscal  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues recognized of was slightly higher than the fiscal percentage of 
the increase was due primarily to cost increases and a change in the mix of revenues recognized in fiscal to more costly projects 
in fiscal  we delivered million homes in projects for which we are using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
at october   our backlog of homes in communities that we accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting was million net of million of revenue recognized compared to million at october  net of million of revenue recognized 
the decline in the backlog at october  was primarily the result of the recognition of revenues and a decline in contracts signed 
revenues and costs land sales we are developing several communities in which we expect to sell a portion of the land to other builders or entities 
the amount and profitability of land sales will vary from year to year depending upon the sale and delivery of the specific land parcels 
in fiscal and  land sales revenues were million and million  respectively  and the cost of land sales revenues was approximately and of land sales revenues  respectively 

table of contents interest expense in our communities accounted for using the completed contract method of accounting  we determine interest expense on a specific lot by lot basis  and for land sales we determine interest expense on a parcel by parcel basis 
as a percentage of total revenues  interest expense varies depending on many factors  including the period of time that we owned the land  the length of time that the homes delivered during the period were under construction  and the interest rates and the amount of debt carried by us in proportion to the amount of our inventory during those periods 
for projects that used the percentage of completion method of accounting  interest expense was determined based on the total estimated interest for the project and the percentage of total estimated construction costs that had been incurred 
any change in the estimated interest expense for the project was applied to current and future periods from the date the estimate was made 
interest expense as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a spending decreased by million  or in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the reduction in spending was due primarily to cost reductions  offset in part by the expenses resulting from the increased number of communities from which we were operating during fiscal  as compared to fiscal at october   we had selling communities  a increase over the selling communities we had at october  goodwill impairment during fiscal  due to the continued decline of the detroit market  we re evaluated the carrying value of goodwill associated with a acquisition 
we estimated the fair value of our assets in this market  including goodwill 
fair value was determined based on the discounted future cash flow expected to be generated in this market 
based upon this evaluation and our expectation that this market would not recover for a number of years  we determined that the related goodwill was impaired 
we recognized a million impairment charge in fiscal after recognizing this charge  we did not have any goodwill remaining from this acquisition 
loss earnings from unconsolidated entities we are a participant in several joint ventures and in the trust and trust ii 
we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings from these entities 
many of our joint ventures are land development projects or high rise mid rise construction projects and do not generate revenues and earnings for a number of years during the development of the property 
once development is complete  the joint ventures will generally  over a relatively short period of time  generate revenues and earnings until all the assets of the entities are sold 
because there is not a steady flow of revenues and earnings from these entities  the earnings recognized from these entities will vary significantly from period to period 
in fiscal  we recognized million of losses from unconsolidated entities as compared to million of earnings in fiscal the fiscal loss was attributable to million of impairment charges on two of our investments in unconsolidated entities in our quarter ended october  interest and other income in fiscal  we recognized million of interest and other income  as compared to million in fiscal the million increase in fiscal was primarily the result of the recognition into income of million of retained customer deposits in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  a million gain realized from the sale of our security business  a million gain realized from the sale of our cable tv and broadband internet business  and an million increase in interest income in fiscal  as compared to income before income taxes income before taxes in fiscal was million  a decrease of from the billion earned in fiscal 
table of contents income taxes income taxes were provided at an effective rate of in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal  as compared to fiscal was due primarily to lower pretax income reported in fiscal  as compared to fiscal and the greater impact of individual components of the provision for income taxes on the overall rate in fiscal  as compared to the fiscal rate 
the effective state income tax rate for fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal the increase in the state tax rate was the result of the allocation of our income and losses to the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and the tax rates in those jurisdictions 
in addition  in fiscal  we reported higher tax free income  an increase in our estimated interest provided on anticipated tax assessments and a lower amount of expiring state tax provisions  as compared to fiscal we also recognized million and million of manufacturing and other tax credits in fiscal and fiscal  respectively

table of contents capital resources and liquidity funding for our business has been provided principally by cash flow from operating activities  before inventory additions  unsecured bank borrowings and the public debt and equity markets 
prior to fiscal  we used our cash flow from operating activities  before inventory additions  bank borrowings and the proceeds of public debt and equity offerings to acquire additional land for new communities  fund additional expenditures for land development  fund construction costs needed to meet the requirements of our backlog  invest in unconsolidated entities  purchase our stock  and repay debt 
in fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents increased by million to billion 
cash flow from operating activities was million 
cash flow from operating activities was generated primarily from income before inventory and investment impairment losses  reductions in inventory  and a decrease in contracts receivable related to percentage of completion accounting  offset  in part  by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses excluding accruals of estimated liabilities to various joint ventures  a decrease in customer deposits and an increase in deferred tax assets 
the decreased inventory  contracts receivable  accounts payable and customer deposits were due primarily to the decline in our business as previously discussed 
we used million of cash flow in investing activities  primarily for additional investments in unconsolidated entities 
in addition  we used million of cash flow in financing activities  primarily for the repayment of debt  offset in part  by cash generated from stock based benefit plans and the tax benefits of stock based compensation 
in fiscal  we generated million of cash  including million from operating activities and million from investing activities  offset  in part  by the use of million in financing activities 
in the fiscal period  net cash generated from operating activities was primarily attributable to income before write offs  offset  in part  by a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses  a reduction in customer deposits and an increase in deferred tax assets 
at october   the aggregate purchase price of land parcels under option and purchase agreements was approximately million including million of land to be acquired from joint ventures in which we have invested 
of the million of land purchase commitments  we had paid or deposited million and had invested in or guaranteed loans on behalf of our joint ventures of million which will be credited against the purchase price of the land 
the purchases of these land parcels are scheduled over the next several years 
we have additional land parcels under option that have been excluded from the aforementioned aggregate purchase amounts since we do not believe that we will complete the purchase of these land parcels and no additional funds will be required from us 
in general  our cash flow from operating activities assumes that  as each home is delivered  we will purchase a home site to replace it 
because we own several years supply of home sites  we do not need to buy home sites immediately to replace those which we deliver 
in addition  we generally do not begin construction of our single family detached homes until we have a signed contract with the home buyer  although in the past several years  due to the high cancellation rate of customer contracts and the increase in the number of attached home communities from which we were operating all of the units of which are generally not sold prior to the commencement of construction  the number of speculative homes in our inventory increased significantly 
should our business remain at its current level or decline from present levels  we believe that our inventory levels would continue to decrease as we complete and deliver the homes under construction but do not commence construction of as many new homes  as we complete the improvements on the land we already own and as we sell and deliver the speculative homes that are currently in inventory  resulting in additional cash flow from operations 
in addition  we might continue to delay or curtail our acquisition of additional land  as we have since the second half of fiscal  which would further reduce our inventory levels and cash needs 
at october   we owned or controlled through options approximately  home sites  as compared to approximately  at october   and approximately  at april   the high point of our home sites owned and controlled 
during the past several years  we have had a significant amount of cash invested in either short term cash equivalents or short term interest bearing marketable securities 
in addition  we have made a number of investments in unconsolidated entities related to the acquisition and development of land for future home sites or in entities that are constructing or converting apartment buildings into luxury condominiums 
our investment activities related to marketable securities and to investments in and distributions of investments from unconsolidated entities are contained in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows under cash flow from investing activities 

table of contents we have a billion credit facility consisting of a billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility collectively  the credit facility with banks  which extends to march at october   we had no outstanding borrowings against the revolving credit facility but had letters of credit of approximately million outstanding under it 
under the terms of the credit facility  our maximum leverage ratio as defined in the agreement may not exceed to and at october   we were required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth as defined in the agreement of approximately billion 
at october   our leverage ratio was approximately to  and our tangible net worth was approximately billion 
we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our current operations and meet our contractual obligations through a combination of existing cash resources and our existing sources of credit 
due to the deterioration of the credit markets and the uncertainties that exist in the economy and for home builders in general  we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace existing financing or find sources of additional financing in the future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our estimated contractual payment obligations at october  amounts in millions thereafter total senior and senior subordinated notes a loans payable a mortgage company warehouse loan a operating lease obligations purchase obligations b retirement plans c other a amounts include estimated annual interest payments until maturity of the debt 
of the amounts indicated  billion of the senior and senior subordinated notes  million of loans payable  and million of the mortgage company warehouse loan were recorded on the october  consolidated balance sheet 
b amounts represent our expected acquisition of land under options or purchase agreements and the estimated remaining amount of the contractual obligation for land development agreements secured by letters of credit and surety bonds 
c amounts represent our obligations under our k  deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement plans 
of the total amount indicated  million has been recorded on the october  consolidated balance sheet 
inflation the long term impact of inflation on us is manifested in increased costs for land  land development  construction and overhead 
we generally contract for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin 
accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes will affect our profits 
prior to the current downturn in the economy and the decline in demand for homes  the sales prices of our homes generally increased 
because the sales price of each of our homes is fixed at the time a buyer enters into a contract to purchase a home  and because we generally contract to sell our homes before we begin construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
we generally attempt to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
the slowdown in the homebuilding industry over the past several years and the decline in the sales prices of our homes  without a corresponding reduction in the costs  have had an adverse impact on our profitability 

table of contents in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect our interest costs 
if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance home purchases  our revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford new homes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our earnings and cash flow 
we do not have the obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until we are required to refinance such debt 
at october   our debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates  and estimated fair value were as follows amounts in thousands fixed rate debt variable rate debt a weighted weighted average average fiscal year of maturity amount interest rate amount interest rate thereafter discount total fair value at october  a based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at october   and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each increase in interest rates would increase the interest incurred by us by approximately million per year
