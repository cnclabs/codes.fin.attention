item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company is a non operating holding company whose income is derived from the earnings of five wholly owned subsidiaries 
we are engaged primarily in the collection  storage  treatment and distribution of potable water for domestic  industrial  commercial and fire protection service in new hampshire through our three utility subsidiaries pennichuck water works  inc pennichuck water  pennichuck east utility  inc pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct company  inc 
pittsfield 
our water utility revenues constituted of our consolidated revenues in pennichuck water  our principal subsidiary which was established in  accounted for of our consolidated revenues 
pennichuck water s franchise area presently includes the city of nashua  new hampshire the city and surrounding municipalities 
our water subsidiaries are regulated by the new hampshire public utilities commission the nhpuc and must obtain nhpuc approval to increase their water rates to recover increases in operating expenses and to obtain the opportunity to earn a return on investments in plant and equipment 
new hampshire law provides that utilities are entitled to charge rates which permit them to earn a reasonable return on the cost of the property employed in serving their customers  less accrued depreciation  contributed capital and deferred income taxes rate base 
the cost of capital permanently employed by a utility in its utility business marks the minimum rate of return that a utility is lawfully entitled to earn on its rate base 
capital expenditures associated with complying with federal and state water quality standards have historically been recognized and approved by the nhpuc for inclusion in water rate s  though there can be no assurance that the nhpuc will approve future rate increases in a timely or sufficient manner to cover our capital expenditures 
the businesses of our two other subsidiaries are non regulated water management services and real estate development and investment 
pennichuck water service corporation service corporation provides various non regulated water related monitoring  maintenance  testing and compliance reporting services for water systems for various towns  businesses and residential communities in and around southern and central new hampshire 
its most significant contracts are with the towns of hudson and wilton  new hampshire and the towns of salisbury and barnstable  massachusetts 
the southwood corporation southwood is engaged in real estate management and commercialization activities 
historically  most of southwood s activities were conducted through real estate joint ventures 
during the past years  southwood has participated in four residential joint ventures with john p 
stabile ii  stabile a local developer 
southwood s earnings have from time to time during that period contributed a significant percentage of our consolidated net income 
southwood s contributions from the sale of real estate have increased the fluctuations in our net income during that period 
we expect that southwood will contribute a smaller proportion of our future revenues and earnings excluding the effects of the january sale of the three commercial office buildings that comprised substantially all of the assets of hecop i  ii and iii as more fully des cribed elsewhere in this annual report on form k

we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
events significantly affecting our earnings during recent years overview 
our earnings during the five year period ended december  were significantly affected by the following events that occurred during one or more years of that period sales of land by southwood  which were especially significant in  sale of one cell tower lease in and eight cell tower leases in increased recorded amounts of afudc as a result of the ongoing construction of our water treatment plant  our actions to oppose ongoing efforts by the city of nashua  new hampshire that began in to acquire all or a significant portion of pennichuck water s assets through an eminent domain proceeding under new hampshire utility law  defense and settlement costs related to parallel investigations by the us securities and exchange commission the sec and the new hampshire bureau of securities regulation the bureau that were conducted primarily in and settled in december  and expenses related to the merger agreement that we entered into in april with aqua america inc formerly known as philadelphia suburban corporation and terminated in february southwood real estate related revenues 
our revenues and earnings were positively affected by sales of southwood land during three of the past five years 
the following table sets forth the amount of revenues that we recognized during each year in the to period attributable to those land sales and the percentage that those revenues represented of our total revenues during each of those years 
year southwood land sales of consolidated revenues s we expect that southwood s revenues from land sales will constitute a relatively minor percentage of our future consolidated revenues excluding the effects of the january sale of the three commercial office buildings that comprised substantially all of the assets of hecop i  ii and iii as more fully described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain proceeding 
the city of nashua s mayor stated his opposition to our proposed merger with aqua america almost immediately after we announced it 
in january  nashua residents approved a referendum authorizing the city to pursue the acquisition of our assets by eminent domain or otherwise 
in march  as part of the eminent domain process  the city filed a petition with the nhpuc seeking approval to acquire all of our water utility assets  whether or not related to our nashua service area 
the eminent domain proceeding and potential consequences for us are described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents the eminent domain merits hearing before the nhpuc began on january   but was subsequently suspended through july   by agreement of the parties stay agreement to allow the city and pennichuck to engage in settlement discussions 
on july   the stay agreement expired without the parties having reached a settlement of their eminent domain dispute 
while we have publicly stated our willingness to consider any future comprehensive settlement proposals the city may wish to make  to our knowledge none are currently pending 
we remain vehemently opposed to the city s proposed eminent domain taking of pennichuck water assets 
the merits hearing resumed on september  and concluded on september  briefs summarizing the arguments of each party were filed in the fourth quarter a ruling by the nhpuc on the city s petition may be issued at any time 
our annual eminent domain related expenses in through were million  million  million and million  respectively 
sec and new hampshire investigations and settlement 
we and our former president and chief executive officer were the subject of parallel investigations by the sec and the bureau that began in early and late  respectively  as disclosed in previous filings  including the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  effective december   the sec and the bureau entered into settlements with the former ceo and us 
under the terms of the new hampshire settlement  our company s shareholders as of march  received a payment totaling  as of march  the former ceo was financially responsible for  of that amount and our company was responsible for the balance 
our investigation related expenses were  in   in and in and terminated merger agreement 
we entered into an agreement in april to be acquired in a merger with aqua america inc in february  before the merger was submitted to our shareholders  we agreed with aqua america to abandon the proposed transaction because of actions taken by the city of nashua  summarized below  to attempt to acquire all or a significant portion of pennichuck water s assets by eminent domain 
we incurred million and  of merger related expenses that we recognized in and  respectively 
critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as those policies critical to our business operations and the understanding of the results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in significant changes to the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows 
regulatory accounting 
the use of regulatory assets and liabilities as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation stipulates generally accepted accounting principles for companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator such as the nhpuc 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we defer costs and credits on the consolidated balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from when the costs and credits are incurred 
these deferred amounts  both assets and liabilities  are then recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the same period that they are reflected in rates charged to our water utilities customers 
 in the event that the inclusion in the rate making process is disallowed  the associated regulatory asset or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or change in regulatory approval 
we did not defer the costs associated with the terminated merger agreement with aqua america  our defense against the city s ongoing eminent domain proceeding or the sec and bureau regulatory investigations and settlements 
revenue recognition 
the revenues of our water utility subsidiaries are based on authorized rates approved by the nhpuc 
estimates of water utility revenues for water delivered to customers but not yet billed are accrued at the end of each accounting period 
we read our residential customer meters generally on a quarterly basis and 
table of contents record revenues based on meter reading results 
unbilled revenues from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period are estimated based on historical usage patterns and the effective water rates 
the estimate of the unbilled revenue is a management estimate utilizing certain sets of assumptions and conditions 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
accrued unbilled revenues recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
our non utility revenues are recognized when services are rendered 
revenues are based  for the most part  on long term contractual rates 
pension and other post retirement benefits 
our pension and other post retirement benefits costs are dependent upon several factors and assumptions  such as employee demographics  plan design  the level of cash contributions made to the plans  earnings on the plans assets  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets and health care cost trends 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  changes in pension and post retirement benefit obligations other than pensions pbop associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension and pbop costs in the consolidated statements of income  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of the plans participants 
in determining pension obligation and expense amounts  the factors and assumptions described above may change from period to period and such changes could result in material changes to recorded pension and pbop costs and funding requirements 
further  the value of our pension plan assets  which partially consist of equity investments  are subject to fluctuations in market returns which may result in increased or decreased pension expense in future periods 
these conditions impacted the funded status of our pension plan at both december  and and  therefore  will also impact pension expense for our pension plan currently meets the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of accordingly  we anticipate that we will contribute approximately  to the plan during this contribution includes approximately  to reduce the plan s unfunded status  per current requirements under the pension protection act 
results of operations general in this section  we discuss our  and results of operations and the factors affecting them 
our operating activities  as discussed in greater detail in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  are grouped into three reportable business segments as follows water utility operations  water management services  real estate operations  and other our consolidated revenues tend to be significantly affected by weather conditions experienced throughout the year and  from time to time  by final orders of the nhpuc on our requests for rate increases 
water revenues are typically at their lowest point during the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
water revenues in the second and third quarters tend to be greater because of increased water consumption for nonessential usage by our customers during the late spring and summer months 
results of operations compared to overview 
for the year ended december   our consolidated net income was million  compared to net income of  in on a per share basis  fully diluted income per share for was as compared to per share for the increase in consolidated net income of million for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the following factors 

table of contents beneficial factors an increase in regulated water utility operating income of million  a reduction in net eminent domain related costs of million costs are net of a  cash payment received from the city of nashua  and other income of million pre tax from the sale of one cell tower lease in february and seven cell tower leases in june compared to other income of  from the sale of one cell tower lease in november partially offsetting factors an increase in the income tax provision of million  reduced interest income of  a decrease in afudc in the amount of  an increase in interest expense of  due to increased long term borrowings  and the receipt in of a payment in the amount of  representing a settlement with our prior directors and officers insurance provider 
our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in our combined revenues was primarily attributable to rate relief granted to pennichuck water and pennichuck east  and to combined water utility customer growth 
water utility operations 
our water utility operations include the activities of pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield  each of which is regulated by the nhpuc 
on a combined basis  net income of our three utilities for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from water utility operating revenues increased by million as a result of rate increases and customer growth 
the combined utility customer base during the year increased  resulting in a total combined customer base of approximately  as of december  water utility operating income also benefited from a change in the method of allocating certain overhead and administrative costs between regulated and non regulated operations 
we believe that due to the combined effects of an economic slowdown in the commercial and industrial sectors  changing demographics and conservation measures  water consumption from existing customers has generally been declining 
such decline was mitigated during the third quarter due to higher consumption resulting from dryer weather in compared to we also believe that there is a potential for further consumption decline that may result from increased customer conservation efforts as a result of two matters 
future rate increases  as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  could lead to decreased consumption 
also  the implementation of automated meter reading equipment that allows for monthly billing  rather than quarterly billing  may also give rise to further water conservation 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by increases in operating expenses 
our utility operating revenues increased to approximately million in  or from for  approximately  and of our total utility operating revenues were generated by pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield  respectively  as shown in the following table 
change s pennichuck water pennichuck east pittsfield total see regulation under item i in this annual report on form k for a discussion of rate matters 

table of contents for the year ended december   utility operating expenses increased by approximately million  or approximately  to approximately million as shown in the table below 
change s operations maintenance depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total the operations and maintenance expenses of our water utility business include such categories as water supply  treatment  purification and pumping  transmission and distribution system functions  including repairs and maintenance and meter reading  and engineering  customer service and general and administrative functions 
the change in our utilities operating expenses over the same period in was primarily the result of the following  of increased production costs largely related to increased fuel  power and purification costs for pennichuck water and pennichuck east  partially related to increased pumpage in the third quarter  as well as the incremental costs from pittsfield s acquisition of its north country operations in the second quarter of   of increased transmission and distribution costs relating to repair or replacement of gates  mains  meters and hydrants  supplies  fuel and labor costs   of increased engineering and general and administrative costs primarily relating to costs for employee benefits  property and casualty insurance and administrative salaries  increased depreciation and amortization of  principally due to increased depreciation attributable to completed portions of the water treatment plant upgrade  and increased taxes other than on income of  principally in our core pennichuck water system 
increased costs are expected to be ongoing in our utilities future cost of providing water service 
as such  our utilities expect to periodically seek rate relief  as necessary  to recover increasing costs as they occur 
for the year ended december    and of the combined utilities operating income was provided by pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield  respectively  compared to  and for the year ended december   respectively 
pittsfield is planning to file a new request for rate relief prior to mid primarily to seek recovery of increases in certain operating expenses since  the test year for purposes of its most recent rate increase awarded in  as well as to obtain recovery of and a return on several million dollars of capital expenditures incurred for the rehabilitation and upgrade of systems acquired in mid as described above 
water management services 
the following table provides a breakdown of revenues from our non regulated water management services operations for the years ended december  and change s municipal contracts community system contracts watertight program miscellaneous total the combined base fees under service corporation s municipal contracts represent million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  with the balance of  and  representing fees earned for services performed in addition to the base scope of services for and 
table of contents  respectively 
of the net decrease of  in total municipal contract revenue   is attributable to a decrease in revenue from services that were performed in addition to the base scope  offset by a  increase in revenue covered by the base scope of the municipal contracts 
contract revenues from community system contracts for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  representing operating contracts at the end of december and december for the years ended december  and  service corporation s revenues included  and  respectively  relating to fees earned under its watertight program 
this program provides maintenance service to residential customers for a fixed annual fee 
at the end of december  approximately  customers were enrolled in this program  representing a increase from for the year ended december   total operating expenses associated with our water management services remained unchanged from at million 
these costs are comprised primarily of direct costs for servicing our various operating contracts as well as allocated intercompany charges for general and administrative support for contract operations 
total operating costs include an increase of  in intercompany charges resulting from a change in our allocation methodology  as well as an increase in the actual level of corporate expenses 
the resultant increase was essentially offset by a  decrease in marketing expenses  an  decrease in professional fees and a  decrease in maintenance expenses 
real estate operations 
for the year ended december   southwood s total net revenues were  compared to  in in the table below  we show the major components of southwood s revenues during and s operating revenue sale of timber lease income tower rental parking lot income total operating revenues other income loss  net income loss from unconsolidated equity investments other income sale of westwood park llc other income loss  net total net revenue the decrease in our real estate total net revenues resulted principally from reduced timber sales and losses attributed to our share of the hecop entities  partly offset by a gain on the sale of westwood park llc 
as of december  and  southwood had a ownership interest in four joint ventures organized as limited liability companies  as discussed in greater detail under off balance sheet arrangements and also under note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the remaining ownership interest in each joint venture was then primarily held by john p 
stabile ii  a local developer  with whom southwood has also participated in four residential joint ventures during the past years 
southwood uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in the joint ventures 
consequently  southwood s investment is adjusted for its share of earnings or losses and for any distributions received from the joint venture 
for the year ended december   southwood s share of pre tax earnings from these joint ventures was approximately  compared to pre tax loss of  for the increase in the joint ventures pre tax earnings resulted primarily from increased occupancies in the hecop i and hecop iii buildings during southwood s share of pre tax earnings loss is included under net earnings loss from investments accounted for under the equity method in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

table of contents in january  we announced the sale of the three commercial office buildings that comprised substantially all of the assets of hecop i  ii and iii as more fully described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
therefore  future equity method earnings or losses  resulting from the joint ventures will be insignificant 
expenses associated with our real estate operations were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of  was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately  which was partially offset by decreased intercompany charges of  southwood s operating expenses consisted primarily of  in net salaries and benefits   for general and administrative costs and  in allocated intercompany charges due to additional company resources utilized for the planning and development of our existing land portfolio

other income from the sale of cell tower leases and the insurance settlement are non recurring items 
allowance for funds used during construction afudc 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded afudc of approximately  and million  respectively 
the  decrease is largely attributable to the completion  effective january   of the second of three major phases of pennichuck water s upgrade to its water treatment plant 
interest income 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded interest income of approximately  and  respectively 
the amount primarily relates to interest earned on funds received from our equity and debt offerings that were temporarily invested in money market securities 
interest expense 
for the year ended december   our consolidated interest expense was approximately million  compared to million in the increase of  is primarily attributable to the issuance of million and million principal amount of tax exempt bonds in october and october  respectively

liquidity and capital resources overview 
our primary sources of funds are cash flow from utility operations  cash proceeds from the sale of portions of our real estate holdings  borrowings pursuant to our bank revolving credit facility and proceeds from the sale of long term debt and equity securities 
our primary uses of funds are capital expenditures associated with our continuous utility construction programs  dividends on our common stock payable as and when declared by our board of directors and repayments of principal on our outstanding debt obligations  whether pursuant to scheduled sinking fund payments or final maturities 
for the past several years  cash flows from operations have fluctuated largely based on four factors i weather  ii amount and timing of rate increases  iii gains recognized on the sale of southwood land and cell tower leases  as more fully discussed above  and iv the costs associated with the city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain proceeding and costs related to the sec and bureau regulatory investigations that were settled in december  each discussed in more detail above 
during through  in addition to cash flow from operations  we realized a substantial amount of net new proceeds from the sale of various debt securities totaling million

for the period to  comparable expenditures are expected to total million 
the amounts shown as other in the table above reflect expenditures for actual or potential acquisitions of small regional regulated water utility systems  consistent with our record of prior acquisitions and expenditures in our non regulated water management services operations 
external financing requirements 
due to the significant size of our utility construction program in as described above  we expect that only to of our funding requirements will be provided by cash flow from our operations after payment of dividends on common stock 
we expect that the balance of our funding requirements will be obtained through our cash and short term investment balances as well as long term debt arrangements and the issuance of common stock pursuant to our drcspp 
for and  due to a substantial decrease in our projected capital expenditures as shown in the table above we expect a majority of our funding requirements will be provided by cash flow from our operations after payment of dividends on common stock 
our timing and mix of future debt and equity financing is subject to a number of factors including  but not limited to i debt and equity market conditions  ii the need to maintain a balanced capital structure in order to preserve financial flexibility and to manage the overall cost of capital  and iii certain debt issuance covenants as contained in our outstanding loan agreements 
there is no assurance that we will be able to complete all or any of the future debt and equity financings described below or to complete them on a timely basis 
the receipt of timely and adequate rate relief will also be critically important in providing us cash flow from operations and the ability to access credit and permanent capital  both debt and equity  at reasonable costs and terms 
we are unable  however  to predict the outcome of our future rate relief filings 
on october   pennichuck water arranged for the issuance of an aggregate  of long term tax exempt bonds through the business finance authority the authority of the state of new hampshire  consisting of three separate series of bonds a through c with coupon rates ranging from to and a maturity date of october  on the date of issuance of the bonds  the authority loaned the proceeds of the series a bonds totaling  to pennichuck water to finance upgrades to its water facilities 
the proceeds of the series b and the series c bonds totaling  and  respectively  were deposited in escrow on the date of issuance which  upon request by pennichuck water on october  and october   respectively or such other dates as pennichuck water may request the proceeds of the series b bonds or the series c bonds  as applicable  would be loaned to pennichuck water to finance the project 
amounts held in escrow are for the sole benefit of the bondholders with no recourse to us until loaned to pennichuck water and hence we have not recorded the associated debt as a long term liability 
we expect to draw these funds as we incur capital expenditures for various water facilities projects  primarily the water treatment plant upgrade project and we will then record the associated debt as a long term liability 
as permitted under the terms of the master agreement  pennichuck water borrowed  as of october    of the proceeds of the series b bonds to finance a portion of the project cost 
this portion of the series b bonds was designated as the series b bonds 
the series b bonds are subject to mandatory tender on october  the remaining  of the proceeds of the series b bonds  designated as the series b bonds  were re deposited into an escrow account maintained by the bank of new york trust company  na  as escrow agent  until april  due to the then current confidential negotiations with the city as well as the then current limitations on incurring additional long term debt under its interest coverage test  pennichuck water elected on april  to re escrow the proceeds of the series b bonds to october  on october   pennichuck water borrowed an additional million of the proceeds of the series b and series c bonds  this portion was designated as the series bc bonds 
the series bc bonds are not subject to mandatory tender prior to maturity on october  the interest rate on the series bc bonds is subject to adjustment every days pursuant to certain auction procedures 
the remaining million of the proceeds of the series b and series c bonds  designated as the series bc bonds has been re deposited into an escrow account until may  at that time  pennichuck water expects to borrow a portion of the proceeds of the series bc bonds 
the remaining balance  if any  would be re deposited into an escrow account until october  
table of contents pennichuck water is actively pursuing a conversion of its million series bc bonds from auction rate mode to one or more fixed rate term modes 
such conversion is expected to close on or about may  upon the october  mandatory tender date for its series b bonds  pennichuck water expects to remarket such bonds for a new fixed rate term period 
as more fully discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k see item legal proceedings we expect the nhpuc to rule definitively on the city s eminent domain petition shortly although there is no statutory timetable governing such ruling 
given the highly uncertain outcome of this proceeding  we may find that we are unable to  or elect not to  issue or remarket such debt securities pending the definitive ruling on the city s petition or we may find that the cost that we incur in connection with the issuance or remarketing of such debt increases materially 
we believe these risks are particularly relevant to a portion of the long term tax exempt bonds that were issued on our behalf in through the business finance authority of the state of new hampshire 
of the initial million offering  proceeds totaling approximately million are currently held in escrow for the sole benefit of the bondholders 
the associated debt is non recourse to us until the proceeds are loaned to pennichuck water 
upon one or more requests by pennichuck water  some or all of the proceeds of those bonds will be loaned to pennichuck water to finance its water treatment plant upgrade and other certain other capital projects 
when pennichuck water borrows the bond proceeds  the associated bonds will be remarketed to investors who will be relying on pennichuck water as the source of repayment rather than the escrow fund 
if  because of the uncertainties described above relating to th e eminent domain dispute  pennichuck water is unable to  or elects not to  remarket the bonds as debt securities for which pennichuck water is liable  it would not be able to borrow any of the bond proceeds then in escrow and the associated debt would not become pennichuck water s obligation 
under these circumstances  we would expect to rely primarily on our cash flow from operations  our cash and short term investment balances and  thereafter  on our bank revolving credit facility to finance pennichuck water s water treatment plant upgrade and other capital projects 
our borrowing cost under that credit facility would likely be materially higher than tax exempt bond financing costs 
borrowings under the credit facility would also reduce our liquidity to meet other obligations 
in addition to authorizing a tax exempt bond financing  we have applied and will continue to apply for long term debt funds directly from the state of new hampshire under the state s revolving fund program srf 
funds provided under the srf loans carry long term fixed costs at interest rates set with reference to various municipal bond indices  which rates are generally below the rates for comparable us treasury securities of like maturity 
as of december   we had seven outstanding srf loans with actual draw downs aggregating approximately million 
we have commenced documentation for our eighth srf loan  a requested commitment of up to  to fund a portion of certain pennichuck east capital improvements 
we expect to have a document closing on this srf loan in the second quarter of and to begin draw downs later in during  we expect to draw down approximatel y an additional million on existing and new srf loans 
significant financial covenants our million revolving credit facility with bank of america  which matures june   contains three financial maintenance tests which must be met on a quarterly basis 
these maintenance tests are as follows our fixed charge coverage ratio must exceed x  our tangible net worth must exceed million  plus new equity issued subsequent to december  and our funded debt less certain cash and short term investment balances  if any must not exceed of our total capitalization 
also  various pennichuck water and pennichuck east loan agreements contain tests that govern the issuance of additional indebtedness 
these issuance tests are as follows to issue short term debt  our total debt must not exceed of our total capital unless the new short term debt is subordinated to existing debt  to issue long term debt  our funded debt must not exceed of our property additions  and 
table of contents to issue long term debt  our earnings available for interest divided by our interest expense must exceed x 
on august   pennichuck water implemented a legal defeasance transaction for its outstanding  new hampshire industrial development authority series tax exempt bonds series bonds 
pennichuck water placed us treasury securities in an irrevocable escrow account with the bank of new york  the bond trustee  in an aggregate amount sufficient to provide for all remaining scheduled principal and interest payments on the series bonds 
this defeasance transaction discharged all future pennichuck water obligations with respect to the series bonds and pennichuck water will no longer record the debt in its consolidated financial statements 
in addition  pennichuck water will no longer be subject to the covenants under the series bonds  one of which restricted pennichuck water from issuing long term debt unless pennichuck water s earnings available for interest divi ded by its interest expense exceeded 
certain covenants as described below in pennichuck water s and pennichuck east s loan agreements and in our bank of america revolving credit loan agreement effectively restrict our ability to upstream common dividends from pennichuck water and pennichuck east  as well as pay common dividends to our shareholders 
several of pennichuck water s loan agreements contain a covenant that requires pennichuck water to maintain a minimum net worth of million 
as of december   pennichuck water s net worth was million 
one of pennichuck east s loan agreements contains a covenant that requires pennichuck east to maintain a minimum net worth of million 
as of december   pennichuck east s net worth was million 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
our ability to incur significant additional long term debt and to continue to satisfy these tests depends  among other factors  on receipt of timely and adequate rate relief 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  southwood had a ownership interest in four joint ventures organized as limited liability companies 
the remaining ownership interest in each of the joint ventures was then primarily held by john p 
stabile ii  a local developer with whom southwood has also participated in four other residential joint ventures during the past ten years 
the formation of these joint ventures provided southwood with an opportunity to develop its landholdings in such a manner as to provide for a long term income stream through commercial rental activities 
additionally  the joint ventures  as legal entities  mitigate the financial risk associated with sole ownership of developed commercial properties by southwood 
the joint ventures  whose assets and liabilities are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  owned certain commercial office buildings on which there w ere outstanding mortgage notes totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the mortgage notes were each secured by the underlying property 
in addition  southwood was then contingently liable on one half of the outstanding balances of three of the four outstanding mortgages  and as such  it issued a guarantee to the mortgagee for its share of the guaranteed indebtedness 
as of december   southwood was contingently liable on approximately million of mortgage indebtedness associated with the limited liability companies 
in addition  if either hecop ii or hecop iii defaulted on its indebtedness  southwood s investment in the other hecop would have been at risk  because each of hecop ii and iii guaranteed the indebtedness of the other 
southwood s investments in hecop i iii had an aggregate carrying value of  as of december  distributions from the joint ventures ha ve from time to time during the past ten years been a significant source of funds to support our dividend payments to shareholders 
we account for southwood s investment in the four current joint ventures using the equity method of accounting  meaning that we recognize on a current basis of each joint venture s operating results 
those results reflect ongoing carrying costs such as maintenance and property taxes 
information about our revenues  expenses and cash flows arising from the joint ventures is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have assessed these equity investments in accordance with fin r consolidation of variable interest entities  and have determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities 
in january  we announced the sale of the three commercial office buildings that comprised substantially all of the assets of hecop i  ii and iii 
our share of net cash proceeds  after retirement of mortgage notes and payment of expenses of sale  but before income taxes  was approximately million 
the first quarter pre tax non operating income from this sale is approximately million 

table of contents in october  we completed a tax exempt debt financing with the new hampshire bond finance authority bfa 
the bfa acts solely as a passive conduit to the tax exempt bond markets with us acting as the obligor for the associated tax exempt debt 
as of december  we had borrowed million representing a portion of the million offering conducted in october the remaining million was placed in escrow for the sole benefit of bondholders with no recourse to us and hence we have not recorded the associated debt as a long term liability 
we expect to draw these funds as we incur capital expenditures for various water facilities projects  primarily the water treatment plant upgrade project and record the associated debt as a long term liability in and  if necessary  the company has one interest rate financial instrument  an interest rate swap  which qualifies as a derivative under statement of financial accounting standards no

pennichuck water has a wholesale water agreement the agreement with manchester nh water works mww to purchase water from mww through six metering points for various community water systems owned by pennichuck water and pennichuck east 
the agreement  amended in february  has a year term and provides for an average daily flow to pennichuck water and pennichuck east of up to million gallons per day mgd with a maximum daily flow rate of mgd 
pennichuck water and pennichuck east purchase water at a rate established by mww for all of its non manchester customers 
the current rate  effective january   is per one hundred cubic feet ccf in areas where fire protection is not provided by mww and per ccf where fire protection is provided 
the agreement requires that pennichuck water and pennichuck east pay a one time source development charge  sdc of for each gallon  effective february   of the million gallons of the average daily flow 
to date  pennichuck water and pennichuck east had achieved a combined peak average daily flow of  gallons 
the sdc is re calculated annually to reflect any increases in average daily flow and  if the flow is increased  pennichuck water and pennichuck east pay the sdc for the incremental demand 
any incremental sdc is payable in january of each year 
sdc payments began in and as of december   the total sdc paid to mww was  which allows pennichuck water to draw an average daily flow of up to  the incremental sdc paid in and was  and  respectively 
in january  pennichuck prepurchased an additional  of capacity from mww at the old sdc rate of per gallon 
as of december   we have no defined commitments for future purchases under this agreement 
in april  pennichuck water entered into a long term lease arrangement with hecop iii  llc for  square feet of office space located in merrimack  new hampshire which serves as our headquarters 
this lease expires in april and we have commenced discussions regarding a multi year extension 
southwood held a ownership interest in hecop iii  llc and the remaining ownership interests were held by john p 
stabile ii  who also was a holder of ownership interests in three other llc joint ventures with southwood as discussed above 

table of contents in january  we announced the sale of the three commercial office buildings that comprised substantially all of the assets of hecop i  ii and iii 
our share of net cash proceeds  after retirement of mortgage notes and payment of expenses of sale  but before income taxes  was approximately million 
the first quarter pre tax non operating income from this sale is approximately million 
pension plan 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of our employees 
the accounting for this plan under financial accountings standard board fasb no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  requires that we use key assumptions when computing the estimated annual pension expense 
these assumptions are i the discount rate applied to the projected benefit obligation  ii the long term rate of return on plan assets and iii the long term rate of future increases in compensation 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of our pension obligations and our annual pension expense 
a range of discount rates is established and periodically modified by the internal revenue service to calculate a pension plan s current benefit obligation for purposes of the full funding limits imposed on such plans 
our expected lon g term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on the plan s expected asset allocation  expected returns on various classes of plan assets as well as historical returns 
we assumed that our long term rate of return on pension plan assets was in  and in addition  we assumed an increase in participant compensation levels of in  and these key assumptions are reviewed annually with our actuary and investment advisor and are updated to reflect the plan s experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from our actuarial assumptions because of economic and other conditions which may impact the amount of pension expense we recognize 
dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan 
we offer a dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase program that is available to our shareholders  employees and customers 
under this program  our shareholders may reinvest all or a portion of their common stock dividends into shares of common stock at prevailing market prices 
we also accept optional cash payments to purchase additional shares at of the prevailing market prices 
this program has provided us with additional common equity of  in and  in environmental matters 
our water utility subsidiaries are subject to the water quality regulations set forth by the environmental protection agency epa and the new hampshire department of environmental services des 
the epa is required to periodically set new maximum contaminant levels for certain chemicals as required by the federal safe drinking water act sdwa 
the quality of our treated water currently meets or is better than all standards set by the epa and the des 
however  increased monitoring and reporting standards have led to additional operating costs for us 
any additional monitoring and testing costs arising from future epa and des mandates should eventually be recovered through water rates in our utilities future rate filings 
pennichuck water s filtration plant in nashua is impacted by the interim enhanced surface water treatment rule rule  which established a new turbidity standard of nephelometric turbidity units or ntu 
turbidity is a measure of sediment or foreign particles that are suspended in the water 
we have allocated approximately million in our capital expenditures budget for the continued construction of such required improvements 
pennichuck water estimates the total cost to comply with this new standard to be approximately million 
at december   an aggregate million of such capital expenditures had been incurred and the remaining amount is expected to be incurred largely in  and to a lesser extent  in the total cost includes all construction and engineering associated costs necessary to complete the required treatment plant upgrad es from the initiation of the project in to initial construction in and to expected completion in the spring of  although such estimates are subject to any future changes in the rule and changes in design and construction that may be required 
capital expenditures associated with complying with federal and state water quality standards have historically been recognized and approved by the nhpuc for inclusion in our water rates  though there can be no assurance that the nhpuc will approve future rate increases in a timely or sufficient manner to cover our capital expenditures

our exposure to financial market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our million revolving credit facility and our million series bc tax exempt auction rate bonds that contain variable interest rates 

table of contents our revolving credit facility  which includes a total borrowing capacity of million  permits us to borrow  repay and re borrow  in varying amounts and from time to time at our discretion through june  borrowings under this credit facility bear interest rates ranging from the london interbank offered rate libor plus to libor plus based on the results of various financial ratios 
the applicable margin as of december  was 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december  during we do not expect to borrow under this facility 
the interest rate for our million series bc tax exempt auction rate bonds is subject to adjustment every days pursuant to certain auction procedures as more fully described in the related financing documents 
the initial interest rate  per annum for the period october  thru october  was established pursuant to negotiations between pennichuck water and its tax exempt bond underwriters 
the first three auctions of the series bc bonds were successful and resulted in per annum rates of  and for the day periods commencing november   december  and january   respectively 
the ensuing auction held on february  failed ie there were insufficient bids to cover the amount of bonds available for sale 
in such instances  the interest rate is reset to the so called  fail rate which is equal to a proscribed percentage based on the then current credit rating of the auction rate bonds of the day libor rate 
pursuant to this rate setting provision  the interest rate for the series bc bonds was reset to a per annum rate of for a seven day period 
thereafter  auctions are to be held every seven days until an auction succeeds 
each auction subsequent to the february th auction has failed 
the average per annum interest rate for all failed auctions of the series bc bonds is 
pennichuck water is actively pursuing a conversion of its million series bc bonds from auction rate mode to one or more fixed rate term modes 
such conversion is expected to close on or about may  we also have a million variable interest rate loan with a bank 
the loan  which was originally scheduled to mature in april  was extended to december  in april  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the bank that also has a maturity date of december  the purpose of this swap agreement is to mitigate interest rate risks associated with our million floating rate loan 
the agreement provides for the exchange of fixed interest rate payments for floating interest rate payment obligations on notional amounts of principal totaling million 
the floating rate loan with the bank contains interest rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus based on the results of various financial ratios 
the applicable margin as of december  was resulting in an interest rate of 
we designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge against the variable future cash flows associated with the interest payments due on the million of notes 
the combined effect of its libor based borrowing formula and the swap produces an all in fixed borrowing cost equal to the fair market value of our interest rate swaps represents the estimated unrealized loss to terminate these agreements based upon current interest rates
