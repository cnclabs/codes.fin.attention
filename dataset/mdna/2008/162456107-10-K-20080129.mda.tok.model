the proceeds from the term loan under the credit facility were used to finance in part the j j acquisition 
the credit facility includes accordion features that permit us under certain circumstances to increase our borrowings under the revolving credit facility by million and to borrow an additional million as a term loan 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility portion of the credit facility bear interest at libor plus applicable percentages of to or the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate the base rate 
the term loan under the credit facility bears interest of either libor plus or the base rate plus 
the term loan borrowings are to be repaid in increments of million each calendar quarter  with the first principal payment due and paid on june  the principal outstanding after scheduled repayment and any unscheduled prepayments is due january  in april  we entered into an amendment to our credit facility that  among other things  permitted the sale of the convertible senior notes due the convertible notes and reduced the applicable interest rates on the revolving credit facility portion of our credit facility 
in april  we completed a private offering of million of the convertible notes 
the convertible notes bear interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually on may and november of each year  with the first interest payment due and paid on november  concurrently with the sale of the convertible notes  we purchased a note hedge for million and issued warrants for proceeds of million with an affiliate of merrill lynch the counterparty

several different estimates or methods can be used by management that might yield different results 
the following are the significant estimates used by management in the preparation of the november  consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts as of november   an estimate was made of the collectibility of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
this estimate requires the utilization of outside credit services  knowledge about the customer and the customer s industry  new developments in the customer s industry and operating results of the customer as well as general economic conditions and historical trends 
when all these facts are compiled  a judgment as to the collectibility of the individual account is made 
many factors can impact this estimate  including those noted in this paragraph 
the adequacy of the estimated allowance may be impacted by the deterioration in the financial condition of a large customer  weakness in the economic environment resulting in a higher level of customer bankruptcy filings or delinquencies and the competitive environment in which the customer operates 
during the year ended november   we performed an assessment of the collectibility of trade accounts receivable and did not make any significant adjustments to our estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the balance of allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at november  and  respectively 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when our products are shipped and title transfers to our customers 
it is generally our policy across all classes of customers that all sales are final 
as is common in the consumer products industry  customers return products for a variety of reasons including products damaged in transit  discontinuance of a particular size or form of product and shipping errors 
as sales are recorded  we accrue an estimated amount for product returns  as a reduction of these sales  based upon our historical experience and consideration of discontinued products  product divestitures  estimated inventory levels held by our customers and retail point of sale data on existing and newly introduced products 
the level of returns may fluctuate from our estimates due to several factors including weather conditions  customer inventory levels and competitive conditions 
we charge the allowance account for product returns when the customer provides appropriate supporting documentation that the product is properly destroyed or upon receipt of the product 
we separate returns into the two categories of seasonal and non seasonal products 
we use the historical return detail of seasonal and non seasonal products for at least the most recent three fiscal years on generally all products  which is normalized for any specific occurrence that is not reasonably likely to recur  to determine the amount of product returned as a percentage of sales  and estimate an allowance for potential returns based on product sold in the current period 
to consider product sold in current and prior periods  an estimate of inventory held by our retail customers is calculated based on customer inventory detail 
this estimate of inventory held by our customers  along with historical returns as a percentage of sales  is used to determine an estimate of potential product returns 
this estimate of the allowance for seasonal and non seasonal returns is further analyzed by considering retail customer point of sale data 
we also consider specific events  such as discontinued product or product divestitures  when determining the adequacy of the allowance 
our estimate of product returns for seasonal and non seasonal products as of november  was million and million  respectively  and million and million  respectively  as of november  higher sales volume in fiscal offset by customers returning seasonal product earlier in the season resulted in our estimate of returns for seasonal products remaining consistent as compared to fiscal higher sales volumes in fiscal caused an increase in our estimate of returns for seasonal products by approximately million  which resulted in a decrease to net sales in our consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  our estimate of non seasonal returns remained consistent as compared to fiscal during fiscal  as a result of our estimate of customer inventory levels  historical non seasonal product returns and retail point of sale data  we increased our estimate of non seasonal returns by approximately million  which resulted in a decrease to net sales in our consolidated financial statements 
each percentage point change in the seasonal return rate would impact net sales by approximately million 
each percentage point change in the non seasonal return rate would impact net sales by approximately million 
at november   based on consideration of the sales of icy hot pro therapy performing below expectations  review of retail point of sales data throughout fiscal and an estimate of inventory on hand at customers  we estimated returns of icy hot pro therapy as of november  of million  which was included as a reduction of net sales 
during fiscal  we continued to monitor icy hot pro therapy retail sales and inventory levels on hand at customers and increased the specific reserve for icy hot pro therapy by million as of november   which is included as a reduction of net sales in our consolidated financial statements 
we routinely enter into agreements with customers to participate in promotional programs 
the cost of these programs is recorded as either advertising and promotion expense or as a reduction of sales as prescribed by emerging issues task force  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
a significant portion of the programs are recorded as a reduction of sales and generally take the form of coupons and vendor allowances  which are normally taken via temporary price reductions  scan downs  display activity and participations in in store programs provided uniquely by the customer 
we also enter into cooperative advertising programs with certain customers  the cost of which is recorded as advertising and promotion expense 
in order for retailers to receive reimbursement under such programs  the retailer must meet specified advertising guidelines and provide appropriate documentation of the advertisement being run 
we analyze promotional programs in two primary categories coupons and vendor allowances 
customers normally utilize vendor allowances in the form of temporary price reductions  scan downs  display activity and participations in in store programs provided uniquely by the customer 
we estimate the accrual for outstanding coupons by utilizing a third party clearinghouse to track coupons issued  coupon value  distribution and expiration dates  quantity distributed and estimated redemption rates that are provided by us 
we estimate the redemption rates based on internal analysis of historical coupon redemption rates and expected future retail sales by considering recent point of sale data 
the estimate for vendor allowances is based on estimated unit sales of a product under a program and amounts committed for such programs in each fiscal year 
estimated unit sales are determined by considering customer forecasted sales  point of sale data and the nature of the program being offered 
the three most recent years of expected program payments versus actual payments made and current year retail point of sale trends are analyzed to determine future expected payments 
customer delays in requesting promotional program payments due to their audit of program participation and resulting request for reimbursement is also considered to evaluate the accrual for vendor allowances 
the costs of these programs are often variable based on the number of units actually sold 
as of november   the coupon accrual and reserve for vendor allowances were million and million  respectively  and million and million  respectively  as of november  each percentage point change in promotional program participation would impact net sales by million and advertising and promotion expense by an insignificant amount 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability 
we record income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements based on an estimated annual effective income tax rate 
our estimated annual effective income tax rate during fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal  as a result of lower deductions for charitable contributions and greater apportionment in states with higher statutory tax rates
