item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under the caption entitled item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
our fiscal year ends on september and unless otherwise noted  future references to years refer to our fiscal year rather than a calendar year 
overview consolidation and segments 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of headwaters  all of our subsidiaries  and other entities in which we have a controlling interest 
all significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
we made one acquisition in and several smaller acquisitions in and these entities results of operations for the periods from the acquisition dates through september  have been consolidated with our results  their operations prior to the dates of acquisition have not been included in the consolidated results for any period 
we currently operate in three industries building products  coal combustion products ccps and energy 
in the building products segment  we design  manufacture  and sell architectural stone and resin based exterior siding accessories such as shutters  mounting blocks  and vents  concrete block and other building products 
revenues consist of product sales to wholesale and retail distributors  contractors and other users of building products 
we are a nationwide leader in the management and marketing of ccps  including fly ash used as a substitute for portland cement 
revenues in the ccp segment consist primarily of product sales with a small amount of service revenue 
in the energy segment  we are focused on reducing waste and increasing the value of energy related feedstocks  primarily in the areas of low value coal and oil 
revenues for the energy segment through december  consisted primarily of sales of chemical reagents and license fees related to our former section k business 
beginning january   and for the foreseeable future  revenues for this segment consist primarily of coal sales 
operations and strategy 
during the past several years  we have executed our two fold plan of maximizing cash flow from our existing operating business units and diversifying from significant reliance on the legacy energy segment section k formerly section business 
with the addition and expansion of our ccp management and marketing business through acquisitions beginning in  and the growth of our building products business through several acquisitions beginning in  we have achieved revenue growth and diversification in three business segments 
because we also incurred increased indebtedness to make strategic acquisitions  one of our historical financial objectives has been to focus on increasing cash flows to reduce debt levels 
in  our primary focus has been on growing our coal cleaning business and our current primary use of cash consists of capital expenditures  primarily in the energy segment for coal cleaning facilities 
a material amount of our consolidated revenue and net income through december  was derived from license fees and sales of chemical reagents  both of which were dependent on the ability of licensees and other customers to manufacture and sell qualified synthetic fuel that generated tax credits under section k of the internal revenue code 
we have also claimed section k tax credits for synthetic fuel sales from facilities in which we owned an interest 
by law  section k tax credits for synthetic fuel produced from coal expired for synthetic fuel sold after december  with the expiration of section k at the end of calendar  our licensees synthetic fuel facilities and the facilities we owned were closed because production of synthetic fuel was not profitable absent the tax credits 
the closure of these synfuel facilities has had  and will continue to have  a material adverse effect on our current and future revenue  net income and cash flow  when compared to prior periods 
section k tax credits were subject to phase out after the average annual us wellhead oil price reference price reached a beginning phase out threshold price  and would have been eliminated entirely if the reference 
table of contents price had reached the full phase out price 
the calendar reference price and phase out range were announced in calendar and accordingly  in the march and june quarters we adjusted previously recognized revenue and tax credits as required to reflect the finalized phase out 
the existence and unpredictability of phase out has materially adversely affected both the amount and timing of recognition of our revenue  net income and cash flow beginning in fiscal and continuing into at the current time  we do not believe there are any material residual contingencies related to phase out 
we own and operate several new and recently renovated coal cleaning facilities that remove rock  dirt  and other impurities from waste coal  resulting in higher value  marketable coal 
in addition  we are currently constructing several additional coal cleaning facilities  which will begin operating prior to december  construction of these facilities was our largest single investment of cash during fiscal and currently we expect construction activities in the energy segment and other segments to be our most significant investment of cash in capital expenditures in were financed primarily with available cash and with lease financing 
in  coal sales were million  compared to million in our ccp segment business strategy is to continue to negotiate long term contracts with suppliers supported by investment in transportation and storage infrastructure for the marketing and sale of ccps 
we are also continuing our efforts to expand the use of high value ccps and to develop more uses for lower value ccps  such as blending 
our building products segment has been significantly affected by the depressed new housing and residential remodeling market and our current strategy is to reduce operating costs as much as possible and be positively positioned to take advantage of an industry turnaround at some point in the future 
we are also continuing to develop new building products and leverage our robust distribution system which we believe is a competitive advantage for us 
our ccps and building products businesses are significantly affected by seasonality  with the highest revenue and profitability produced in the june and september quarters 
our acquisition strategy targets businesses that are leading companies in their respective industries and that have strong operating margins  thus providing additional cash flow that complements the financial performance of our existing businesses 
in  we began to acquire small companies in the building products industry with innovative products that can be marketed using our existing distribution channels 
we are also committed to continuing to invest in research and development activities that are focused on energy related technologies and nanotechnology 
we participate in joint ventures that operate an ethanol plant located in north dakota and a hydrogen peroxide plant in south korea 
we are also investing in other energy projects such as the refining of heavy crude oils into lighter transportation fuels 
in and subsequent years  we focused on the integration of our large acquisitions  including the marketing of diverse kinds of building products through our national distribution network 
we became highly leveraged as a result of those acquisitions  but reduced our outstanding debt significantly since that time through cash generated from operations  from an underwritten public offering of common stock and from proceeds from settlement of litigation 
during through  we made several early repayments of our long term debt 
in  early repayments of long term debt decreased as compared to earlier years primarily due to our investments of available cash in developing and growing our coal cleaning business in the energy segment 
significant cash needs for capital expenditures will continue in  so we are focused on liquidity to enable us to continue implementing our growth plans 
although our historical emphasis on the early repayment of long term debt has diminished temporarily  a significant amount of our long term debt is repayable beginning in management believes that operational improvements and the continued growth in the coal cleaning business will increase cash flow from operations and that this increase  along with the cash flow currently being generated  will provide sufficient funds to retire this maturing debt 
furthermore  we believe there may be additional alternatives to restructure our current credit facilities and capitalization 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are identified and described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u 
s 
generally accepted 
table of contents accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our policies and estimation procedures 
estimates are often based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  but which could change in the future 
some of our accounting policies and estimation procedures require the use of substantial judgment  and actual results could differ materially from the estimates underlying the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
such policies and estimation procedures have been reviewed with our audit committee 
the following is a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 
license fee revenue recognition 
through december   we licensed our technologies to the owners of coal based solid alternative fuel facilities in the us license agreements contained a quarterly earned royalty fee generally set at a prescribed dollar amount per ton or a percentage of the tax credits earned by the licensee 
recurring license fees or royalty payments were recognized in the period when earned  which coincided with the sale of alternative fuel by our licensees  provided standard revenue recognition criteria such as amounts being fixed or determinable were met 
in most instances  we received timely reports from licensees notifying us of the amount of solid synthetic fuel sold and the royalty due us under the terms of the respective license fee agreements 
additionally  we experienced a regular pattern of payment by these licensees of the reported amounts 
estimates of license fee revenue earned  where required  could be reliably made based upon historical experience and or communications from licensees with whom an established pattern existed 
in some cases  however  such as when a licensee was beginning to produce and sell synthetic fuel or when a synthetic fuel facility was sold by a licensee to another entity  and for which there was no pattern or knowledge of past or current production and sales activity  there may have been more limited information available to estimate the license fee revenue earned 
in these situations  we used such information as was available and where possible  substantiated the information through such procedures as observing the levels of chemical reagents purchased by the licensee and used in the production of the solid synthetic fuel 
in certain limited situations  we were unable to reliably estimate the license fee revenues earned during a period  and revenue recognition was delayed until a future date when sufficient information was known from which to make a reasonable estimation 
the amount of license fee revenue recognized during and was negatively affected by reduced revenues for certain licensees whose license agreements called for us to be paid a portion of the tax credits earned by the licensee 
certain accounting rules limit revenue recognition to amounts that were fixed or determinable and as a result of uncertainties related to phase out of section k tax credits and other licensee specific factors  the timing of revenue recognition was delayed for certain licensees during those years 
due to publication of the section k calendar reference price and the phase out range  finalization of calendar phase out was made possible during the quarter ended june  as a result of the availability of this information and the clarification of other licensee specific factors  certain calendar and prior year license fee revenue totaling approximately million was recognized in this amount related to periods ending on or prior to december  and was recognized in when it met the fixed or determinable recognition criterion and it was remote that any negative adjustment would be required in the future 
we applied the same policy in with regard to the recognition of revenue for calendar tax credit based license fees 
the final determination of revenue pertaining to fiscal and calendar occurred in when the calendar reference price and phase out range were published and we adjusted previously recognized revenue and tax credits as required to reflect the finalized phase out 
the existence and unpredictability of phase out has materially adversely affected both the amount and timing of recognition of revenue  net income and cash flow beginning in and continuing into at the current time  we do not believe there are any material residual contingencies related to phase out 

table of contents income taxes 
significant estimates and judgments were required in the calculation of our income tax provisions for the years presented 
one of the key estimates affecting our tax provisions was the amount of section k formerly section tax credits that would ultimately be available related to our interest in an entity that owned and operated a coal based solid alternative fuel production facility  plus two other smaller alternative fuel facilities that we owned and operated see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the calendar section k tax credit phase out percentage was not finalized until the quarter ended june  the calendar phase out percentage was not finalized until the quarter ended june  as of september  and  we used our best estimates of what the phase out percentages for calendar and would be  using available information as of those dates 
adjustments to reflect final phase out percentages were reflected in our consolidated financial statements in subsequent periods as necessary 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively 
the impairment charge in was not deductible for tax purposes and most of the impairment charge in was not tax deductible and therefore had a significant negative effect on our reported effective tax rates for both and as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  approximately million of stock based compensation in resulted from the early voluntary cancellation of sars and other stock based awards  requiring an acceleration of expense recognition for unrecognized compensation cost that remained as of the cancellation dates 
as a result of the cancellation of the stock based awards  approximately million of deferred tax assets were written off 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin effective as of october   the beginning of our fiscal year  with a cumulative adjustment to decrease retained earnings and increase income tax liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits by approximately million 
as of september   we had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  net of an million refund claim related to an uncertain tax position 
approximately million of gross unrecognized income tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if released into income 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
for example  we are currently under audit by the irs for the years through and have open tax periods subject to examination by both federal and state taxing authorities for the years through we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and state tax jurisdictions based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined the liabilities are no longer probable or necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of our unrecognized income tax benefits will significantly change within the next months 
these changes could be the result of ongoing tax audits or the settlement of outstanding audit issues 
however  due to the number of years under audit and the matters being examined  at the current time  an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made 
in evaluating our ability to recover our recorded deferred tax assets  in full or in part  all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  is considered and evaluated 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of federal  state and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets consist primarily of identifiable intangible assets obtained in connection with acquisitions 
these intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price for businesses acquired over the fair value of identified assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 we do not amortize goodwill  all of which relates to acquisitions 
sfas no 
requires us to periodically test for goodwill impairment  at least annually  or sooner if evidence of possible impairment arises 
we perform our annual impairment testing as of june  using the two step process described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
with the exception of the tapco reporting unit in and the aggregated building products reporting unit in  the step tests indicated that the fair values of the reporting units  calculated primarily using discounted expected future cash flows  exceeded their carrying values as of the test dates 
accordingly  step of the impairment tests was not required to be performed for those reporting units  and no impairment charges were necessary 
as a result of the depressed new housing and residential remodeling market  the tapco reporting unit failed step in and the aggregated building products reporting unit failed step in this required completion of step  which resulted in a determination that tapco s goodwill was impaired in and the building products segment goodwill was impaired in accordingly  non cash impairment charges of million and million were recorded in and  respectively 
the impairments did not affect our cash position  cash flow from operating activities or senior debt covenant compliance  and will not have any impact on future operations 
as discussed above  the fair values of the reporting units are calculated primarily using discounted expected future cash flows 
there are many estimates and assumptions involved in preparing these expected future cash flows  including most significantly the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows  anticipated long term growth rates  future profit margins  working capital requirements and required capital expenditures 
management uses its best efforts to reasonably estimate all of these and other inputs in the cash flow models utilized  however  it is certain that actual results will differ from these estimates and the differences could be material 
materially different input estimates and assumptions would necessarily result in materially different calculations of discounted expected future cash flows and reporting unit fair values and materially different goodwill impairment estimates 
in addition to the annual review  we evaluate  based on current events and circumstances  the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the useful lives are required 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  or changes in our business model or capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from our current estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful lives of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets should be changed  we amortize the net book value in excess of salvage value over the revised remaining useful lives  thereby prospectively adjusting depreciation or amortization expense as necessary 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flow from that asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
indicators of impairment include such things as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate  a decline in operating performance indicators  a significant change in competition  or an expectation that significant assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
in  the building products segment revised downward the estimated useful lives of certain assets resulting in accelerated depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over shorter periods 
no other significant changes have been made to estimated useful lives during the periods presented 

table of contents it is possible that some of our tangible or intangible long lived assets or goodwill could be impaired in the future and that resulting write downs could be material 
stock based compensation 
we early adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation required by sfas no 
r in we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of stock based awards for all awards expected to vest  over the period during which the related service is rendered by grantees 
the fair value of stock based awards is determined primarily using the black scholes merton option pricing model b s m model  developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of certain subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility 
for stock based awards  we primarily use the graded vesting or accelerated method to allocate compensation expense over the requisite service periods 
our estimated forfeiture rates are based largely on historical data and ranged from to from to  depending on the type of award and the award recipients 
as of september   the estimated forfeiture rate for most unvested awards was per year 
the fair values of stock options and sars have been estimated using the b s m model  adjusted where necessary to account for specific terms of awards that the b s m model does not have the capability to consider 
one such adjustment was used in determining the fair value of sars which had a cap on allowed appreciation 
for these sars  the output determined by the b s m model was reduced by an amount determined by a quasi monte carlo simulation to reflect the reduction in fair value associated with the appreciation cap 
the two most critical estimates in determining fair value are expected stock price volatility and expected lives 
expected stock price volatility was estimated using primarily historical volatilities of our stock 
implied volatilities of traded options on our stock  volatility predicted by a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model  and an analysis of volatilities used by other public companies in comparable lines of business were also considered 
in estimating expected lives  we considered the contractual and vesting terms of awards  along with historical experience  however  due to insufficient historical data from which to reliably estimate expected lives  we used estimates based on the simplified method set forth by the sec in staff accounting bulletins no 
and  where expected life is estimated by summing the award s vesting term and the contractual term and dividing that result by two 
insufficient historical data from which to reliably estimate expected lives is expected to exist for the foreseeable future due to different terms associated with awards granted in recent years  along with other factors 
risk free interest rates used were the us treasury bond yields with terms corresponding to the expected terms of the awards being valued 
as of september   there was approximately million of total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized 
this unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
due to the grant of stock based awards subsequent to september   the amount of total compensation cost related to nonvested awards has increased  and the weighted average period over which compensation cost will be recognized has changed 
approximately million of the stock based compensation resulted from the early voluntary cancellation of sars and other stock based awards  requiring an acceleration of expense recognition for unrecognized compensation cost that remained as of the cancellation dates 
the early voluntary cancellation of sars and other stock based awards was a direct result of our low stock price as compared to the exercise prices of the cancelled sars 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares our operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
summary 
our total revenue for was million  down from billion for gross profit decreased  from million in to million in operating income decreased from million in to an operating loss of million in net income decreased from million  with diluted earnings per share of  to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in 
table of contents excluding our section k business and the goodwill impairment charges for both and  total revenue in was million  down from million in  gross profit was million in  down from million in  and operating income decreased from million to million in net income in was million with diluted earnings per share of  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in revenue and gross margins 
the major components of revenue  along with gross margins  are discussed in the sections below 
building products segment 
sales of building products during were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
sales of building products during were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the decrease in sales of building products in was due primarily to the continuing effects of the depressed new housing and residential remodeling market which impacted sales across most of our product lines 
also  in early  we sold certain non strategic assets in the building products segment which accounted for approximately million of the decrease in revenue from to the gross margin percentage declined from to due primarily to fewer fixed costs being absorbed as a result of lower sales 
we believe our niche strategy and our focus on productivity improvements tempered somewhat the impact of the severe slowdown in new residential construction 
ccp segment 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the increase in ccp revenues in was due primarily to more ash disposal contracts in compared to the gross margin percentage decreased from to primarily due to geographic and product mix changes 
energy segment 
in  our energy segment revenue consisted almost exclusively of chemical reagent sales  license fee revenue related to our solid alternative fuel technologies and sales of synthetic fuel  all of which related to our section k business 
in  approximately of our energy segment revenue consisted of section k revenue  the substantial majority of which was recognized in the quarter ended december   when our section k business terminated 
coal sales revenue was million in  compared to million in other energy segment revenues were million in operating expenses 
the decrease in amortization expense of million from to was due primarily to intangible assets that have been fully amortized 
research and development expense decreased by million from to primarily because of decreased spending on our coal to liquids and hydrogen peroxide technologies 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in was due primarily to reduced incentive pay expenses and stock based compensation  partially offset by increased spending in our energy segment on coal cleaning growth initiatives 
incentive pay decreased due to reduced profitability of our operations and stock based compensation decreased primarily due to approximately million of accelerated expense related to the early voluntary cancellation of sars and other stock based awards in other income and expense 
during  we reported net other expense of million compared to net other expense of million during the decrease in net other expense of million was comprised of a decrease in net interest expense of approximately million and a net change in other income expense items of approximately million 
net interest expense decreased from million in to million in due to lower variable interest rates and lower average levels of long term debt in as compared to the change in other income expense items of million consisted primarily of a million decrease in costs related to our investment in the coal based solid alternative fuel production facility described in note to the consolidated financial statements  plus million of gain on the sale of property  plant and equipment in 
table of contents compared to a loss of million in the majority of the property  plant and equipment sold in represented non strategic assets in our building products segment 
a portion of the proceeds from this sale were used to acquire assets that have increased the capacity of our texas based concrete block business 
income tax provision 
we recorded income tax provisions with an effective tax rate of approximately in  exclusive of the million goodwill impairment charge  which was not tax deductible and less than in  exclusive of the million goodwill impairment charge  most of which was not tax deductible 
the effective tax rate for disregarding the goodwill impairment charge was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to section k tax credits related to the two coal based solid alternative fuel facilities that we owned and operated  plus our interest in an entity that owned and operated another alternative fuel facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the alternative fuel produced at these three facilities through december  qualified for tax credits pursuant to section k formerly section of the internal revenue code 
the effective tax rate for disregarding the goodwill impairment charge was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to section refined coal tax credits which are different from the section k tax credits discussed above related to several coal cleaning facilities that we own and operate 
we believe it is more likely than not that the refined coal produced at many of these facilities qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  notwithstanding the uncertainties and risks associated with the tax credits  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effect of the tax credits and goodwill impairment charges in both years  our effective tax rate for and would have been approximately and  respectively 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares our operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
revenue 
total revenue for increased by approximately to billion as compared to billion for the major components of revenue are discussed in the sections below 
building products segment 
sales of building products during were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
sales of building products during were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the decrease in sales in was due primarily to the effects of the depressed new housing and residential remodeling market which impacted sales across most of our product lines 
the industry slowdown also was the primary reason for the decline in gross margin percentage from to ccp segment 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the increase in ccp revenues and in the gross margin percentage in were due primarily to a combination of continued strong demand for ccps and upward pricing trends in most concrete markets 
the growth in demand for ccps was due in part to certain regional shortages of portland cement for which ccps are a substitute 
the cement shortages also resulted in increased prices for ccps in several markets 
energy segment 
energy segment revenue consisted primarily of chemical reagent sales  license fee revenue related to our solid alternative fuel technologies  and to a lesser extent  sales of synthetic fuel from two solid alternative fuel production facilities that we owned 
the major components of revenue for the energy segment are discussed in the sections below 
as described previously and in note to the consolidated financial statements  a material amount of our and prior fiscal year consolidated revenue was derived from license fees and sales of chemical reagents  both of which depended on the ability of licensees and other customers to manufacture and sell qualified synthetic fuel that generated tax credits under section k of the internal revenue code 

table of contents sales of chemical reagents 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
chemical reagent sales in were higher than in primarily due to increased synthetic fuel production by most of our licensees resulting in increased sales of million and other customers with whom we do not have a license agreement resulting in increased sales of million 
we believe there was less concern in over phase out of section k tax credits than existed in  due partly to mitigation efforts such as hedging  which resulted in increased synthetic fuel production 
the gross margin percentage for of was lower than the gross margin percentage of due primarily to increases in the cost of product  which in turn were related to increases in the costs of petroleum based materials 
license fees 
during  we recognized license fee revenue totaling million  an increase of million from million of license fee revenue recognized during the amount of license fee revenue recognized during and was negatively affected by reduced revenues being recognized for certain licensees whose license agreements called for us to be paid a portion of the section k tax credits earned by the licensee 
due to uncertainties related to phase out and other licensee specific factors  revenue recognition was deferred for certain licensees during and due to publication of the calendar reference price and the phase out range for that year  finalization of calendar phase out was made possible during the quarter ended june  as a result of the availability of this information and the clarification of other licensee specific factors  certain calendar and prior year license fee revenue totaling approximately million was recognized in this amount related to periods ended on or prior to december  and was recognized in when it met the fixed or determinable recognition criterion and it was remote that any negative adjustment would be required in future periods 
we applied the same policy in with regard to the recognition of revenue for calendar tax credit based license fees 
the final determination of revenue collected pertaining to fiscal and calendar year did not occur until the calendar reference price and phase out range was published in the quarter ended june  reference is made to our policy disclosures discussed previously 
other energy segment revenues 
the majority of other energy segment revenue was comprised of sales of synthetic fuel  which during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
sales of synthetic fuel during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
revenue from the sale of synthetic fuel had a negative gross margin  which was more than compensated for by the income tax credits earned from the sales of the synthetic fuel 
amortization and research and development expenses 
the decrease in amortization expense of million from to was due primarily to intangible assets that have been fully amortized 
research and development expense increased by million from to primarily because of increased spending in our joint research efforts with evonik industries ag formally degussa ag related to hydrogen peroxide and in developmental efforts related to our nanotechnologies 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase in was due primarily to a million increase in payroll and incentive pay at the operating business unit level  a million increase in litigation related costs  and a million increase in stock based compensation 
a majority of the increase in payroll costs related to growth initiatives at the operating business unit level  and increased incentive pay related to improved performance at certain operating business units 
the increase in litigation costs was due to a net credit recorded in because of positive developments in certain legal matters 
those developments resulted in reduced likelihood of ultimate legal liability and the reversal of previously expensed litigation costs 
the higher stock based compensation was due to the cancellation of sars and other stock based awards in and the resultant acceleration of expense recognition for unrecognized compensation cost that remained as of the cancellation dates 

table of contents other income and expense 
during  we reported net other expense of million compared to net other expense of million during the change of million was comprised of a decrease in net interest expense of million and an increase in other expenses of million 
net interest expense decreased from million in to million in  due primarily to the lower interest rate on the million of convertible senior subordinated notes issued in  and lower average levels of long term debt in as compared to the decrease in interest expense caused by those factors was partially offset by million of accelerated amortization of debt issue costs related to early repayments of senior debt in  a majority of which were funded by net proceeds from the new lower rate convertible notes 
the increase in other expenses of million consisted primarily of an increase in costs related to our investment in the coal based solid alternative fuel production facility described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax provision 
we recorded income tax provisions with an effective tax rate of approximately in and in  exclusive of the million goodwill impairment charge  which was not tax deductible 
the effective tax rates are lower than statutory rates primarily due to section k tax credits related to the two coal based solid alternative fuel facilities that we owned and operated  plus our interest in an entity that owned and operated another alternative fuel facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the alternative fuel produced at these three facilities through december  qualified for tax credits pursuant to section k formerly section of the internal revenue code 
excluding the effect of the tax credits in both years and the goodwill impairment charge in  our effective tax rate for and would have been approximately and  respectively 
the section k tax credits used in calculating the income tax provision were estimated as of september  while the calendar phase out percentage could not be finalized at the time  as of september   the estimated phase out percentage of represented our best estimate of what the phase out percentage would be  using available information as of that date 
the effect on income taxes of the change in the calendar phase out percentage from to the actual percentage for the year was recorded to income tax expense in  when the calendar actual oil prices and the phase out range were finalized 
impact of inflation and related matters our operations have been negatively impacted by increased raw materials costs for commodities such as cement  polypropylene and poly vinyl chloride in the building products segment and by increased fuel costs that have affected all of our business units 
the increased costs of polypropylene  poly vinyl chloride and fuel have been caused in part by the increase in prices of petroleum based materials and by supply and demand 
the increased costs of cement appear to be caused by supply and demand and by higher fuel and transportation costs 
we have been successful in passing on some  but not all  of the increased material  fuel and transportation costs to customers 
it is not possible to predict the future trends of these costs  nor our ability to pass on any future price increases to customers 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flow activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended september  was million compared to million for the year ended september  
in both and  the primary investing activities consisted of the purchase of property  plant and equipment and payments for acquisitions 
in  financing activities consisted primarily of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility 
in  our primary financing activities consisted of the issuance of convertible debt and the repayment of senior debt with those proceeds 
more details about our investing and financing activities are provided in the following paragraphs 

table of contents investing activities 
total expenditures for property  plant and equipment in were million  an increase of million over the largest share of capital expenditures in was incurred by the building products segment and represented primarily maintenance of operating capacity  rather than expansion of operations 
in contrast  in  a majority of total capital expenditures was incurred by the energy segment  in particular for expanding the coal cleaning business 
most of our and planned capital expenditures represent expansion of operations  rather than maintenance of operating capacity  primarily due to growth initiatives in the energy segment  particularly the construction of coal cleaning facilities  and in the ccp segment 
our capital expenditures are currently expected to be approximately million 
capital expenditures are limited by our senior debt covenants to million annually  however  in certain circumstances  the unused amount from a fiscal year can be carried forward and used in the subsequent fiscal year 
as of september   we had an unused amount of capital expenditures that was able to be carried forward to which increased the limit for  however  as of september   we had no unused amount available to be carried forward to future periods 
as of september   we were committed to spend approximately million on capital projects that were in various stages of completion  primarily in the energy segment 
in  we realized million of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment  most of which represented non strategic assets in our building products segment 
a portion of the proceeds from this sale was used to acquire assets that increased the capacity of our texas based concrete block business  enabling us to meet current and projected demand in this line of business 
in  we acquired of the ownership interests of dutch quality stone dqs  a privately held company in the building products business 
total consideration paid at the date of acquisition  of approximately million  consisted primarily of cash 
an additional million was paid in  based on earnings of dqs for the month period ended september  that exceeded an agreed upon threshold 
in  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a privately held company in the building products industry 
total consideration for this acquisition was approximately million  of which million was paid in cash at the date of acquisition 
the remaining balance is payable in pursuant to contractual terms for some small acquisitions  additional amounts may be payable in the future  based on the achievement of stipulated revenue or earnings targets for periods ending no later than march at the current time  we do not believe that any such payments will be material 
we are required to periodically test for goodwill impairment  at least annually  or sooner if evidence of possible impairment arises 
as a result of the depressed new housing and residential remodeling market  we recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively 
we intend to continue to expand our business through growth of existing operations  commercialization of technologies currently being developed  and possible strategic acquisitions of products or entities that expand our current operating platform 
acquisitions have historically been an important part of our long term business strategy 
we routinely review potential acquisitions  including those in the areas of building products  ccp marketing  and coal and catalyst technologies 
it is possible that some portion of future cash and cash equivalents and or proceeds from the issuance of stock or debt could be used to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses in the building products  ccp and energy industries  however  because of cash flow considerations and current events affecting the debt and equity markets  we do not currently anticipate any significant acquisitions in our senior secured credit agreement limits acquisitions in the aggregate to million of cash consideration and million of non cash consideration annually  with no more than million of cash consideration for any one acquisition 
if our total leverage ratio  as defined  is less than or equal to  after giving effect to an acquisition  these limitations do not apply 
the senior secured credit agreement also limits the amount we can invest in joint ventures and other less than owned entities 
we have invested in several joint ventures which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting  but do not currently have plans to significantly increase our investments in those entities 

table of contents financing activities 
in  we had net proceeds of million from the issuance of long term debt  representing borrowings from our senior revolving credit facility of million less debt issue costs of million 
the debt issue costs were incurred to obtain an amendment of our senior secured credit facility 
all of the borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility were repaid as of september  and in addition we prepaid million of our outstanding senior secured debt in we have no long term debt repayments that are due prior to in  we made treasury stock purchases totaling million  near the limit established by our senior secured credit agreement 
in  financing activities consisted of the repayment of long term debt and  as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  the issuance of million of convertible senior subordinated notes due february the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes and additional cash on hand were used to repay senior debt and the remaining balance of outstanding notes payable to a bank 
we may  in the future  make optional prepayments of senior debt depending on actual cash flows  our current and expected cash requirements and other applicable factors we deem to be significant 
due to covenants associated with our senior debt  we currently have restrictions on our ability to obtain significant additional amounts of long term debt 
however  we have historically experienced strong positive cash flow from operations which has enabled us to repay a substantial amount of our long term debt prior to scheduled maturities 
while we expect our positive cash flow to continue in the future  our positive cash flow from operations is expected to be lower in than it was in and recent years due to the termination of our section k business  as described previously and in note to the consolidated financial statements  in addition to the continued weakness in the new housing and residential remodeling market 
also  while we have periodically accessed the debt and equity markets in prior years  affordable and available additional debt and equity may be much more difficult for us to obtain in future periods than in the past  due to less favorable market conditions as well as changes in our business model 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for detailed information about our outstanding long term debt and compliance with debt covenants  as well as the available million revolving credit arrangement  which terminates in september the senior credit facility contains restrictions and covenants common to such agreements  including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt  investments  merger and acquisition activity  asset sales and liens  annual capital expenditures in excess of million annually  and the payment of dividends  among others 
in addition  we must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
in  we obtained an amendment to our senior secured credit agreement to provide additional flexibility for capital leases and sale leaseback transactions and to temporarily modify certain of the leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are in compliance with all debt covenants as of september  however  given the continuing decrease in building products revenues as a result of the depressed new housing and residential remodeling market and the termination of our section k business in the energy segment  combined with the high level of capital expenditures during and  there is increased risk of noncompliance with certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios in future periods  particularly during the six month period ending march  approximately million remains available for future offerings of securities under a universal shelf registration statement originally filed in a prospectus supplement describing the terms of any additional securities to be issued is required to be filed before any future offering would commence under the registration statement 
in both and  cash proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchases were not material 
option exercise activity is primarily dependent on our stock price and is not predictable 
to the extent non qualified stock options are exercised  or there are disqualifying dispositions of shares obtained upon the exercise of incentive stock options  we receive an income tax deduction generally equal to the income recognized by the optionee 
such amounts were not material in either or 
table of contents working capital 
as of september   our working capital was million 
notwithstanding the termination of our section k business as of december  and the resulting impact on cash flow  we currently expect operations to produce positive cash flow in future periods and believe working capital  along with available borrowings under the revolving credit arrangement for our seasonal needs  will be sufficient for operating needs for the next months 
income taxes 
historically  our cash requirements for income taxes generally approximated the income tax provision  however  there has often been some lag in paying estimated taxes during a fiscal year due to the seasonality of our operations and because estimated income tax payments are typically based on annualizing the fiscal year s taxable income based on year to date results 
historically  there has also been some lag in realizing cash benefits from the utilization of tax credits due to the interaction of our september fiscal year end and the different fiscal year ends of the entities through which we have received the tax credits 
since fiscal and continuing through  there has been more variability in the relationship between the income tax provision and income tax payments because the tax provision calculation has been materially dependent upon estimating the phase out percentage of section k tax credits see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect our effective income tax rate for and future years to be less than the statutory rate due primarily to the availability of section refined coal tax credits 
these tax credits relate to the coal cleaning facilities that we currently own and operate plus additional facilities that we plan to place in service in the tax credits are expected to reduce required cash payments for estimated taxes during the year they are earned 
as discussed previously  cash payments for income taxes are reduced for tax deductions resulting from disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and from the exercise of non qualified stock options  which amount was not material in or option exercise activity is primarily dependent on our stock price which is not predictable  and likewise  it is not possible to estimate what tax benefits may be realized from future option exercises 
summary of future cash requirements 
significant future cash uses  beyond operational working capital requirements  including income tax payments and interest payments on long term debt  are currently expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures 
potential liquidity risks and management s plans 
most of our potential debt covenant compliance risk relates to compliance with certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios in future periods  particularly through the six month period ending march  the potential risk is primarily a result of declining ebitda combined with increased levels of capital expenditures as compared to prior periods 
ebitda consists of net income adjusted for net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and goodwill impairment  as these items are defined in our senior secured debt agreement 
because our net income has declined significantly from to  ebitda has also declined significantly 
we currently expect our trailing months ebitda  which is used to calculate many of the required leverage and fixed coverage ratios  to decrease through december   then level out and to increase beginning in the quarter ending june  management s plans to minimize the risk of noncompliance with any debt covenant ratios include the acceleration of operational improvements and cost reduction initiatives and increases in cash flow from operations  the delay  postponement or cancellation of planned capital expenditures  the sale of non strategic assets  the sale of equity  the proceeds of which would be used to repay long term debt  additional amendments to our senior secured credit agreement  or restructuring our credit facilities and capitalization 
in addition to the risks of noncompliance with leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios  our million revolving credit arrangement expires in september during  we used this revolver for short term working capital needs and for stand by letters of credit  which at september  totaled million 
we currently expect to use the revolver for seasonal working capital needs and for letters of credit during our seasonal working capital needs should decline as coal cleaning operations continue to grow because this business is less seasonal than our building products and ccp businesses 
we will evaluate our liquidity needs and the potential replacement of the revolving credit facility 

table of contents our million of senior debt is required to be repaid in february and april and we currently believe it is likely that the holders of the convertible senior subordinated notes due  totaling million  could require us to repurchase the notes in june management believes that operational improvements and the continued growth in the coal cleaning business will increase cash flow from operations and that this increase  along with the cash flow currently being generated  will provide sufficient funds to retire this maturing debt 
furthermore  as discussed above  we believe there will be additional alternatives to restructure our current credit facilities and capitalization 
legal matters we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting for legal costs and for other information about legal matters 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating leases for certain facilities and equipment  but otherwise do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
contractual obligations  commitments and contingent liabilities the following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations by period as of september  payments due by fiscal year in millions total after senior secured debt convertible senior subordinated notes total long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations capital expenditures acquisition related liabilities other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations future maturities of long term debt as of september  are shown in the table above using the contractually required repayment dates 
as noted previously  the holders of the convertible senior subordinated notes due june  totaling million  have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on june  we currently believe it is likely that the holders of the notes could require us to repurchase the notes at that time 
if all of the holders of the convertible notes required us to repurchase the notes in june instead of june  the total contractual obligations in the table above would change to million in years and million in years after future interest payments on our variable rate senior secured debt as shown in the table above were calculated based on the actual interest rate in effect as of september  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  our senior debt credit facility provides for up to million of borrowings under a revolving credit arrangement 
borrowings and reborrowings of any 
table of contents available portion of the million revolver can be made at any time through september  when all loans must be repaid and the revolving credit arrangement terminates 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit arrangement as of september  the credit agreement also allows for the issuance of letters of credit  provided there is capacity under the million revolver 
as of september   stand by letters of credit totaling approximately million were outstanding  with expiration dates ranging from december to september as of september   we had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  net of an million refund claim related to an uncertain tax position 
due to the number of years under audit and the matters being examined  at the current time  an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made beyond amounts currently accrued  nor can we reliably estimate the timing of any potential payments 
during  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of several privately held companies in the building products industry 
pursuant to contractual terms for some of the acquisitions  additional amounts may be payable in the future  based on the achievement of stipulated revenue or earnings targets for periods ending no later than march at the current time  we do not believe that any such payments will be material 
reference is made to the caption compensation arrangements in note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of potential commitments to certain officers and employees under employment agreements  long term incentive cash bonus awards  executive change in control agreements  and performance unit awards 
amounts in addition to those included in the table above could become obligations under the terms of these agreements  depending upon the future events described in note we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business  including the specific matters discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
we do not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our operations  cash flow or financial position 
historically  costs paid to outside legal counsel for litigation have comprised a majority of our litigation related costs 
during  we incurred approximately million of expense for legal matters  which consisted primarily of costs for outside legal counsel 
we currently believe the range of potential loss for all unresolved matters  excluding costs for outside counsel  is from million up to the amounts sought by claimants and have recorded a total liability as of september  of million 
claims and damages sought by claimants in excess of this amount are not deemed to be probable 
our outside counsel currently believe that unfavorable outcomes of outstanding litigation are neither probable nor remote and declined to express opinions concerning the likely outcomes or liability to us 
it is not possible to estimate what litigation related costs will be in future periods 
the matters discussed in note raise difficult and complex legal and factual issues  and the resolution of these issues is subject to many uncertainties  including the facts and circumstances of each case  the jurisdiction in which each case is brought  and the future decisions of juries  judges  and arbitrators 
therefore  although management believes that the claims asserted against us in the named cases lack merit  there is a possibility of material losses in excess of the amounts accrued if one or more of the cases were to be determined adversely against us for a substantial amount of the damages asserted 
it is possible that a change in the estimates of probable liability could occur  and the changes could be material 
additionally  as with any litigation  these proceedings require that we incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time and other personnel resources  in pursuing resolution 
recent accounting pronouncements reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of accounting pronouncements that have been recently issued which we have not yet adopted 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily related to changes in interest rates and certain foreign currencies 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we have entered into certain hedge transactions in the past  primarily to limit our variable interest rate exposure  but there are no such hedges outstanding as of september  the blue flint joint venture has derivatives in place related to variable interest rates and commodities 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  our senior debt  which totaled million as of september   bears interest at a variable rate 
accordingly  assuming no change in the amount of senior debt outstanding  a change in the interest rate of would change our interest expense by million during the months ending september  we have limited operations in foreign jurisdictions 
however  one of our joint ventures with evonik industries ag owns a hydrogen peroxide business located in south korea 
this joint venture has million approximately million at september  of long term debt along with other obligations denominated in euros 
because the debt and other obligations are payable in a currency different from the korean won  the joint venture s functional currency  they must be remeasured into korean won at the end of each reporting period based on then current exchange rates  with the impact recorded in earnings 
as a result of this requirement  the joint venture is subject to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
during the year ended september  the joint venture recorded foreign currency exchange losses of which million has been included in our results of operations 
as of september   a change in the relationship between the euro and korean won of would result in a gain or loss of approximately million for us
