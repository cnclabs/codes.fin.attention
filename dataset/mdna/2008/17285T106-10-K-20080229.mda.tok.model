the company is the third largest radio broadcasting company in the united states based on net broadcasting revenue 
the company owns and operates radio stations and holds federal communications commission fcc licenses in states and the district of columbia 
radio stations serving the same geographic area ie  principally a city or combination of cities are referred to as a market 
the company aggregates the markets in which it operates into one reportable segment radio markets as defined by sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the company has a well clustered radio station portfolio that is diversified by programming formats  geographic regions  audience demographics and advertising clients 
in addition to owning and operating radio stations  we also own and operate the abc radio network radio network  which produces and distributes a variety of news and news talk radio programming and formats 
the radio network is a leading radio network and syndicator with approximately  station affiliates and  program affiliations and is a separate reportable segment as defined by sfas no 
our top markets accounted for approximately of the radio markets segment revenue as reported 
on a pro forma basis for the year ended december   adjusted for the results of abc radio and any significant dispositions  our top markets contributed approximately of radio markets segment revenues 
on a pro forma basis as discussed above  the radio markets segment and the radio network segment contributed approximately and approximately  respectively  of our consolidated pro forma net revenues 
for additional information regarding the determination of these pro forma amounts  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents advertising revenue the radio markets primary source of revenue is the sale of local and national advertising 
net revenue is gross revenue less agency commissions 
radio advertising time can be purchased on a local spot  national spot or network basis 
local and national spot purchases allow an advertiser to choose a geographic market for the broadcast of commercial messages and are typically best suited for an advertiser whose business or ad campaign is in a specific geographic area 
local revenue is comprised of advertising sales made within a station s local market or region either directly with the advertiser or through the advertiser s agency 
national revenue represents sales made to advertisers agencies that are purchasing advertising for multiple markets 
these sales are typically facilitated by our national representation firms  which serve as our sales agents in these transactions 
in  approximately of our radio markets net broadcast revenue was generated from the sale of local advertising  and approximately was generated from the sale of national advertising 
the major categories of our radio markets advertisers include automotive companies  restaurants  entertainment companies  medical companies  banks  fast food chains  and grocery stores  and retail merchants 
our revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates our radio stations charge as well as the overall demand for radio advertising time in a market 
advertising rates are based primarily on four factors a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company arbitron  the number of radio stations  as well as other form of media  in the market competing for the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  and the size of the market 
each station s local sales staff solicits advertising either directly from the local advertiser or indirectly through an advertising agency 
through direct advertiser relationships  we can better understand the advertiser s business needs and more effectively design advertising campaigns to sell the advertiser s products 
we employ personnel in each of our markets to assist in the production of commercials for the advertiser 
in house production  combined with effectively designed advertising  establishes a stronger relationship between the advertiser and the station cluster 
national sales are made by a firm specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level  in exchange for a commission based on net revenue 
we also target regional sales  which we define as sales in regions surrounding our markets  to companies that advertise in our markets through our local sales force 
depending on the programming format of a particular station  we estimate the optimum number of advertising spots that can be broadcast while maintaining listening levels 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing advertising inventory 
pricing is adjusted based on local market conditions and our ability to provide advertisers with an effective means of reaching a targeted demographic group 
each of our stations has a general target level of on air inventory 
this target level of inventory may vary throughout the day but tends to remain stable over time 
much of our selling activity is based on demand for our radio stations on air inventory and  in general  we respond to changes in demand by varying prices rather than changing our target inventory level for a particular station 
therefore  most changes in revenue reflect demand driven pricing changes 
a station s listenership is reflected in ratings surveys that estimate the number of listeners tuned to the station and the time they spend listening 
advertisers and advertising representatives use station ratings to consider advertising with the station 
we use station ratings to chart audience levels  set advertising rates and adjust programming 
the radio broadcast industry s principal ratings service is arbitron  which publishes periodic ratings surveys for significant domestic radio markets 
these surveys are our primary source of audience ratings data 
advertising can also be sold on a network basis  which allows advertisers to target commercial messages to a specific demographic audience nationally through the radio network business affiliates on a cost efficient 
table of contents basis compared with placing individual spots across radio station markets 
the radio network generates substantially all of its revenue from the sale of advertising time accumulated from its affiliate stations 
in exchange for the right to broadcast radio network programming  its affiliates remit a portion of their advertising time  and in some cases  an additional fee 
this affiliate advertising is then aggregated into packages focused on specific demographic groups and sold by the radio network to its advertiser clients who want to reach the listeners who comprise those demographic groups on a national basis 
the radio network also generates advertising revenue by embedding a defined number of advertising units in its syndicated programs  which it sells to advertisers at premium prices 
since the radio network generally sells its advertising time on a national basis rather than station by station  the radio network generally does not compete for advertising dollars with the stations in the radio markets 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our revenue will be lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year  while the second and fourth calendar quarters of the year generally produce the highest revenues for the year 
components of expenses our most significant expenses associated with the radio markets are sales costs  programming expenses  advertising and promotional expenses and administrative and technical expenses 
our most significant expenses associated with the radio network are sales costs  production and distribution costs including broadcast rights fees  affiliate compensation  and administrative expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with local management and centralizing functions such as finance  accounting  legal  human resources and management information systems 
we also use our multiple stations  market presence and purchasing power to negotiate favorable rates with vendors 
depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets associated with acquisitions and interest expense incurred from such acquisitions historically have been significant factors in determining our overall profitability 
intangible assets consist primarily of fcc broadcast licenses and goodwill  but also include certain other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   the company ceased amortization of goodwill and fcc licenses  which are indefinite lived intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized in relation to the economic benefits of such assets over their total estimated useful lives 
the company evaluates its fcc licenses by reporting unit for possible impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the company operates its business in two operating segments  radio markets and the radio network 
each geographic market where the company conducts its operations within the radio markets segment is a reporting unit  and the radio network is also a reporting unit pursuant to sfas no 
for purposes of testing the carrying value of the company s fcc licenses for impairment  the fair value of fcc licenses for each reporting unit contains significant assumptions incorporating variables that are based on past experiences and judgments about future performance using industry normalized information for an average station within a market 
these variables would include  but are not limited to the forecasted growth rate of each radio market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  risk adjusted discount rate  the likely media competition within the market area  and expected growth rates in perpetuity to estimate terminal values 
these variables on a reporting unit basis are susceptible to changes in estimates  which could result in significant changes to the fair value of the fcc licenses on a reporting unit basis 
if the carrying amount of the fcc license is greater than its estimated fair value in a given market  the carrying amount of the fcc license in that market is reduced to its estimated fair value  and such reduction may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the company s impairment testing for goodwill in each of its reporting units within its radio markets segment and radio network is also performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
this evaluation is determined based on an income and or market approach for each reporting unit 
the market approach compares recent sales and offering prices of similar properties or businesses 
the income approach uses the subject property s income generated over a specified time and capitalized at an appropriate market rate to arrive at an indication of the most probable selling price 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit  the carrying amount of goodwill of that reporting unit is reduced to its estimated fair value  and such reduction may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
as more fully set forth in critical accounting policies  fcc licenses and goodwill represent a substantial portion of our total assets 
the fair value of fcc licenses and goodwill is primarily dependent on the future cash flows of the radio markets and radio network 
if actual market conditions and operational performance for the respective reporting units underlying the intangible assets were to continue to deteriorate  or if facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the estimated fair value of the fcc licenses and goodwill for these reporting units below their adjusted carrying amounts  the company may also be required to recognize additional non cash impairment charges in future periods  which could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
on february   the company entered into the agreement and plan of merger 
subsequent to entering into the agreement and plan of merger  the operating results of the abc radio business declined 
the agreement and plan of merger was subsequently amended as of november  on june   the company completed the merger 
fcc licenses and goodwill  totaling approximately billion  were recorded as part of the preliminary purchase price allocation and represented a substantial portion of abc radio s total assets 
the fair value of fcc licenses and goodwill associated with the abc radio business is dependent on both the future cash flows expected to be generated by the abc radio business and other market conditions that impact the value a willing buyer would pay for such assets 
due to a continued deterioration in the radio marketplace  the operating results of the abc radio business and the company s stock price decline from the date of the merger through december   the company reviewed the estimated fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the merger as of september   october  the company s annual impairment testing date  and december  for the year ended december   the company recognized a non cash impairment charge of  million  which is comprised of million of fcc license impairment and million of goodwill impairment to reduce the carrying values to their estimated fair values 
if market conditions and operational performance of the respective reporting units within the abc radio business were to continue to deteriorate  or if facts and circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the estimated fair value of the fcc licenses and goodwill below their adjusted carrying amounts  the company may be required to recognize additional non cash impairment charges in future periods  which could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the overall deterioration in the radio marketplace  the operating results of the company s other radio stations and the decline in the company s stock price discussed above and certain reporting units being more likely than not to be disposed  the company conducted interim impairment tests for certain of its other reporting units during the quarter ended september  and as of december   in addition to its annual impairment test as of october  as a result  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million during the year ended december   which is comprised of million and million of fcc licenses and goodwill  respectively  to reduce the carrying values to their estimated fair values 
if market conditions and operational performance of these respective reporting units were to continue to deteriorate  or if facts and circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the estimated fair value of the fcc licenses and goodwill for these reporting units below their adjusted carrying amounts  the company may also be required to recognize additional non cash impairment charges in future periods  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents during the year ended december   the company also recognized a non cash impairment charge of million to write down the carrying amounts to the estimated fair market value related to certain of the eleven stations that were required to be assigned to a divestiture trust upon the closing of the merger and other radio assets for which we had definitive sales agreements 
results of operations our results of operations represent the operations of the radio stations owned or operated by us  or for which we provide sales and marketing services  during the applicable periods  and of the radio network 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
as previously discussed  the merger was completed on june   and accordingly  the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes an allocation to fcc licenses  for which the fair value determination is completed as of december   and a preliminary allocation to the fair market value of the remaining assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the final allocations of the purchase price consideration may differ significantly from the preliminary allocation 
in addition  the statement of operations and cash flows of the company include the cash flows and operations of the abc radio stations and network operations from june  through december  pro forma amounts for and have been adjusted for the results of abc radio and any significant station dispositions 
for additional information regarding the determination of these pro forma amounts  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  we have managed our portfolio of radio stations through selected acquisitions  dispositions and exchanges  as well as through the use of local marketing agreements lmas and joint sales agreements jsas 
under an lma or a jsa  the company operating a station provides programming or sales and marketing or a combination of such services on behalf of the owner of a station 
the broadcast revenue and operating expenses of stations operated by us under lmas and jsas have been included in our results of operations since the respective effective dates of such agreements 
additionally  as opportunities arise  we may  on a selective basis  change or modify a station s format due to changes in listeners tastes or changes in a competitor s format 
this could have an immediate negative impact on a station s ratings  and there are no guarantees that the modification or change to a station s format will be beneficial at some future time 
our management is continually focused on these opportunities as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with any change to a station s format 
we believe that the diversification of formats at our stations helps to insulate our radio markets from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 
we strive to develop strong listener loyalty as audience ratings in local markets are crucial to our stations financial success 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net broadcasting revenue december  december  change amounts in millions net revenues local national net revenue net broadcasting revenues for the year ended december  increased by approximately million from approximately million

this increase is partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense related to the company s towers  transmitters and studio equipment that were recorded as part of the acquisition of the company in june as these assets were substantially fully depreciated during exclusive of any significant station acquisitions or dispositions and any significant change in the purchase price allocation of abc radio  depreciation and amortization expense for the company is expected to increase to approximately million for the year ending december  intangible assets presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  reflect a preliminary allocation to abc radio assets acquired  including fcc licenses and goodwill  which are not subject to amortization  and customer related intangible assets that are being amortized in relation to the economic benefits of such asset over a total estimated useful life of approximately seven years

in addition  other intangible assets that may be recognized include trademarks and trade names  customer related intangible assets  such as backlog  and contract based intangible assets  such as advertising contracts  affiliation agreements  lease agreements  or broadcast programming rights 
by the second quarter of  the company will determine the final allocation of the purchase price based on the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the closing date of the merger 
since the other intangible assets discussed above are expected to have definite lives and would be subject to amortization  amortization expense recognized in periods subsequent to the closing of the merger is expected to increase  which could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations after the merger 
the company estimates that for every million of definite lived intangible assets that are acquired  amortization expense would increase by approximately million to million annually  and net income would decrease by approximately million to million annually  based on estimated useful lives of such intangibles of three to five years and the straight line method of amortization 
every additional million of definite lived intangible assets with useful lives similar to the customer related intangible assets discussed at note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements would be expected to increase amortization by approximately million in the first twelve months after acquisition

the annual limitation is approximately million plus any unrealized built in gains and  assuming no future ownership changes  the company expects to fully utilize existing net operating loss carryforwards within the available carryforward periods 
however  if a future change in control under section occurs  the company s net operating losses could incur additional limitations 
the company will continue to evaluate the deferred tax asset based on the operations of the company and any ownership changes under section to determine whether a change in the valuation allowance will be required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized

depreciation and amortization december  december  change change amounts in millions depreciation and amortization depreciation amortization total depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended december  decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  this decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense related to the company s towers  transmitters and studio equipment that were recorded as part of the acquisition of the company in june as these assets are now substantially fully depreciated 
depreciation and amortization expense  exclusive of any significant station acquisitions or dispositions  is expected to decrease in to approximately million as a result of the substantially fully depreciated assets 
operating loss operating loss was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million as compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the non cash asset impairment charge of million  the increase of non cash stock based compensation of million  and the million relating the fcc s investigation of the company s activities in the area of sponsorship identification  offset by an increase of million in revenues and a decrease of million in depreciation and amortization 

table of contents interest expense  net december  december  change change amounts in millions interest expense  net net interest expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to the higher interest rates under citadel broadcasting s senior credit facility during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and citadel broadcasting s overall increase in outstanding borrowings under its senior credit facility 
the increase in outstanding borrowings was primarily the result of the repurchase of shares of outstanding common stock of the company pursuant to its stock repurchase program during the year 
the company s stock repurchase program may result in additional borrowings under citadel broadcasting s senior credit facility  and this  in addition to higher overall interest rates  is expected to cause interest expense incurred during to continue to be higher than comparable prior year periods 
as more fully discussed in item legal proceedings above  we have received letters from an attorney claiming to represent holders of more than million of the principal amount of our convertibles subordinated notes that purported to be a notice of default under the indenture governing the convertible subordinated notes 
the letters allege that events of default have arisen and continue to arise from the abc radio merger agreement and other agreements relating to the abc transaction 
if any of the events described in the letters were to be an event of default and were to be continuing  subject to the terms and conditions of the indenture  the trustee under the indenture or holders of at least in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes could declare the principal of and accrued interest on all convertible subordinated notes to be due and payable  and there could be an event of default under citadel broadcasting s senior credit facility 
in the event we were required to refinance our convertible subordinated notes  we would expect our interest expense to increase significantly 
additionally  in the event the company completes the merger described in the overview section above  the company expects to refinance citadel broadcasting s senior credit facility with the proceeds of the debt financing expected to be provided under the commitment described more fully in the liquidity and capital resources section below  which will result in substantially higher interest expense in future periods as a result of the increase in indebtedness resulting from the merger 
income tax benefit expense december  december  change amounts in millions income tax benefit expense income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million compared to income tax expense for the year ended december  of million 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  was primarily due to the deferred tax benefit related to the asset impairment 
this benefit was adversely impacted by a partial write off of non deductible goodwill as a result of the asset impairment 
excluding the effects of the asset impairment  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  is 
the effective tax rate in  exclusive of the effects of the asset impairment  differs from the federal tax rate of primarily due to the state taxes and non deductible compensation and other expenses 
the effective tax rate of approximately for the year ended december  differed from the federal tax rate of as a result of state taxes and non deductible expenses 
generally for tax purposes  the company is expected to be entitled to a tax deduction  subject to certain limitations  based on the fair value of the underlying equity awards when the restrictions lapse or stock options 
table of contents are exercised 
through december   the company has recognized pre tax compensation cost of million and million in related deferred tax assets for such awards on a cumulative basis 
as of december   the underlying fair value of equity awards since the date of grant have declined in value and  based on a preliminary analysis  the company does not have an available additional paid in capital pool as defined pursuant to sfas no 
r 
accordingly  absent a subsequent recovery of the underlying fair value of equity awards  when the restrictions lapse or the stock options are exercised or expire  the company may be required to immediately recognize a non cash write down of the deferred tax asset  which may be material to the consolidated results of operations  for the tax effect of the compensation cost previously recognized in the financial statements to the amount that is realized 
in the first quarter of  the compensation committee of the company s board of directors determined that specified performance goals were met for the performance period 
based on non cash stock based compensation expense recognized and the expected tax benefit associated with the vesting of performance vesting shares and the distribution of fully vested stock units with deferred distribution dates the undelivered shares in the first quarter of  the company expects to recognize a non cash write down of its deferred tax asset in the amount of approximately million 
additional non cash write downs of the company s deferred tax assets related to the non cash stock based compensation may be required in future periods as the stock awards vest or expire 
as more fully disclosed in the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company has recognized a deferred tax asset for certain net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes 
in the event that the company completes the merger described in the overview section above  certain restrictions pursuant to section of the internal revenue tax code may limit the combined company s ability to subsequently utilize these tax attributes following the merger 
upon completion of the merger  the company will evaluate the deferred tax asset based on operations of the combined company and determine whether a change in the valuation allowance is required 
the company s state tax rate could also increase subsequent to the closing date of the merger as a result of a change in the jurisdictions in which the combined company will conduct its business 
as a result  upon completion of the merger  we will assess whether a higher state tax rate will be required to be applied to the combined company s taxable income  which could increase the company s effective tax rate and cash taxes on a prospective basis 
in addition  as of the closing date of the merger  we will also evaluate whether to recognize immediately in earnings the change  if any  in the state deferred tax rate expected to be applied to our existing net taxable temporary differences

at each subsequent reporting date  the company measures the estimated fair value of the derivative financial instrument  and any increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the derivative liability is recognized immediately in earnings 
the underlying valuation assumptions used to measure the estimated fair value of derivative financial instrument liability are susceptible to changes in estimates 
these changes in estimates may result in a significant fluctuation in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument liability and may give rise to a significant fluctuation in net income

on april   the company received a second letter from the same attorney claiming that the company failed to cure the alleged defaults during the more than days that elapsed since the company s receipt of the first letter 
the second letter alleges that as a result  an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture 
the second letter also purports to declare the principal amount of the notes  and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon  due and payable immediately 
the company continues to believe that none of the transactions will or do constitute a fundamental change under the indenture 
therefore  the company does not believe that any event of default  as defined in the indenture  has occurred or is continuing and does not believe that any holders have a right to declare obligations under the notes due and payable

sfas no 
r is effective for the company beginning january  and will apply prospectively to any business combinations completed on or after that date 
the company expects that the adoption will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of any acquisitions that the company consummates after the effective date 
critical accounting policies for a summary of the company s significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be 
table of contents reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions 
the following accounting polices require significant management estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and revenue is recognized net of advertising agency commissions 
based on our past experience  the use of these criteria has been a reliable method to recognize revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make payments to us for commercials we have broadcast for our customers 
we specifically review historical write off activity  customer creditworthiness  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and changes in our customer payment terms and conditions when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future allowances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances could be required to reduce our accounts receivable to an amount that is expected to be collectible 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets include fcc licenses  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to fcc licenses and goodwill 
as of december   we had approximately  million in intangible assets  which represent approximately of our total assets  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are subject to renewal every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
subject to delays in processing by the fcc  historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods 
we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future  although we cannot be assured that all of our licenses will be renewed 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of the company s fcc radio station licenses could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  liquidity  financial position  and results of operations 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must conduct annual impairment testing  as well as interim impairment testing if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that assets may be impaired  as required by sfas no 
and charge to the results of operations an impairment expense only in periods in which the recorded carrying amount of these assets is more than their estimated fair value 
we believe our estimate of the value of our fcc licenses and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the fair value contains assumptions incorporating numerous variables that are based on past experience and judgments about future performance of our markets 
these variables would include  but not be limited to forecasted growth rate of each radio market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  risk adjusted discount rate  the likely media competition within the market area  and expected growth rates in perpetuity to estimate terminal values 
we determine the fair value of goodwill using an income and or market approach for each reporting unit 
the market approach compares recent sales and offering prices of similar properties or businesses 
the income approach uses the subject property s income generated over a specified time and capitalized at an appropriate market rate to arrive at an indication of the most probable selling price 

table of contents we evaluate our fcc licenses and goodwill for impairment as of october  our annual impairment testing date  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the annual test requires that the company determine the reporting unit  and compare the carrying amount of the fcc licenses and goodwill reflected on the balance sheet in each reporting unit to the respective fair value of each reporting unit s fcc license and goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the fcc license or goodwill is greater than its respective estimated fair value in a given reporting unit  the carrying amount of the fcc license or goodwill for that reporting unit is reduced to its respective estimated fair value 
we have performed our annual impairment analysis of our fcc licenses and goodwill as of our october testing date 
in addition  we performed interim analyses as of september  and december  due to a continued deterioration in the radio marketplace  the operating results of the abc radio business and the company s other radio stations and a decline in the company s stock price from the date of the merger through december  these analyses make various assumptions about growth rates and market conditions in determining whether impairment exists 
accordingly  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or us or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of our fcc licenses or goodwill below the amounts reflected in the balance sheet  we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future periods  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
contingencies and litigation 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our exposure related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
income taxes 
generally for tax purposes  the company is expected to be entitled to a tax deduction  subject to certain limitations  based on the fair value of the underlying equity award when the restrictions lapse or stock options are exercised 
when the company determines that an equity award is more likely than not to be deductible for tax purposes  the cumulative compensation cost recognized for equity awards pursuant to sfas no 
r and amounts that ultimately will be deductible for tax purposes are temporary differences as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as of december   the company has recognized a deferred tax asset for such equity awards of million 
the tax effect of compensation deductions for tax purposes in excess of compensation cost recognized in the financial statements  if any  will be recorded as an increase in stockholders additional paid in capital when realized 
a deferred tax asset recorded for compensation cost recognized in the financial statements that exceeds the amount that is ultimately realized on the tax return  if any  will be charged to income tax expense when the restrictions lapse or stock options are exercised or expire unless the company has an available additional paid in capital pool as defined pursuant to sfas no 
r 
the company is required to assess whether there is an available additional paid in capital pool as defined pursuant to sfas no 
r when the restrictions lapse or stock options are exercised or expire 
as of december   the underlying fair value of equity awards since the date of grant has declined in value and  based on a preliminary analysis  the company currently does not have an available additional paid in capital pool as defined pursuant to sfas no 
r 
accordingly  absent a subsequent recovery of the underlying fair value of the equity awards  when the restrictions lapse or the stock options are exercised or expire  the company may be required to immediately recognize a non cash write down of the deferred tax asset  which may be material to the consolidated results of operations  for the tax effect of the compensation cost previously recognized in the financial statements to the amount that is realized 
significant management judgment is also required in determining our provision for income taxes  income tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recognized to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we evaluate our tax rates regularly and adjust rates when appropriate based on currently available information relative to statutory rates  apportionment factors and the applicable taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  among other factors 
tax contingencies are also recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
to the extent that we recognize a liability for non deductible 
table of contents expenses  our income tax expense is increased 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability is no longer necessary 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
a number of years may elapse before a tax return containing matters  for which a liability has been recognized  is audited by the taxing authority and finally resolved 
when appropriate  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we believe our estimates of the value of our tax contingencies and valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates as they contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount we have currently accrued 
in past years  our estimated effective tax rate has fluctuated significantly 
share based compensation 
on january   the company adopted sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
recently  a significant percentage of our granted stock based compensation awards contain performance conditions which require significant estimates regarding whether those criteria will be met and may result in significant changes in estimates which could be material to our future results of operations 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method and  accordingly  recognizes compensation cost for stock based compensation for all new or modified grants after the date of adoption 
in addition  the company recognizes the unvested portion of the grant date fair value of awards granted prior to the adoption based on the fair values previously calculated for disclosure purposes 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the assumptions used in the black scholes model requires management to make significant judgments and estimates 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
we have used historical data for our stock price and option life when determining expected volatility and expected term  but each year we reassess whether or not historical data is representative of expected results 
the use of different assumptions and estimates in the black scholes option pricing model could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of option grants and the related expense 
valuation of derivative financial instrument 
we have recorded the fair value of the derivative convertible subordinated note instrument due to our obligation to settle dividends in cash upon conversion  if any  of the convertible subordinated notes in accordance with eitf and sfas no 
this derivative instrument is measured at its estimated fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recorded as a liability 
at each subsequent reporting date  we will measure the estimated fair value of the derivative financial instrument  and any increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the derivative liability is recognized immediately in earnings 
we measure the fair value of the option using assumptions  including the company s current stock price at the end of each reporting period  the expected term of the convertible note  the risk free rate of return  the expected dividend yield and the estimated volatility of our common stock 
changes in these assumptions can significantly change the estimated fair value of the derivative and results of operations 
hedging activities 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates  primarily attributable to borrowings under our senior credit and term facility 
we actively monitor these fluctuations and from time to time may enter into derivative instruments to mitigate the variability of interest payments in accordance with our risk management strategy 
we account for interest rate swap arrangements in accordance with sfas no 
the accounting for changes in the fair values of such derivative instruments at each new measurement date is dependent upon their intended use 
the effective portion of changes in the fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedges of forecasted transactions  referred to as cash flow hedges  are deferred and recorded as a 
table of contents component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged forecasted transactions occur and are recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of changes in the fair values of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are immediately reclassified to earnings 
the differential paid or received on the interest rate swap agreement is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
contractual and commercial commitments in connection with the merger in june  we entered into the senior credit and term facility that provides for million in revolving loans through june  million term loans maturing in june  and  million term loans maturing in june as of december   the company had not borrowed under the revolving portion of its senior credit and term facility  and the company had million outstanding under its convertible subordinated notes 
the table below reflects the company s estimated contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligation less than year to years to years more than years total senior debt convertible subordinated notes interest payments on convertible notes variable interest payments other broadcast programming sports broadcasting and employment contracts operating leases network affiliate agreements other contractual obligations total contractual cash obligations the interest amounts expected to be paid on our senior credit and term facility are estimated based on interest rates in effect as of december  we expect that we will be able to fund our remaining obligations and commitments with cash flow from operations 
to the extent we are unable to fund these obligations and commitments with cash flow from operations  we intend to fund these obligations and commitments with proceeds from borrowings under our senior credit and term facility 
our million in convertible subordinated notes are due february   with interest payable february and august each year 
see further discussion regarding our convertible subordinated notes under the convertible subordinated notes and liquidity and capital resources sections above 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements or transactions 
impact of inflation we do not believe inflation has a significant impact on our operations 
however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a number of financial market risks in the ordinary course of business 
we believe our primary financial market risk exposure pertains to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of our senior credit and term facility  which bears interest based on variable rates 
as of december   we had outstanding indebtedness of  million under our senior credit and term facility 
in june  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement through september with an initial notional amount of  million on which we pay a fixed rate of and receive a variable rate from the counterparty based on a three month london interbank offered rate 
our remaining debt of approximately billion outstanding as of december  is subject to fluctuations in the underlying interest rates 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points applied to this remaining debt 
based on this analysis  the impact on future pre tax earnings for the following twelve months would be approximately million of increased interest expense 
this potential increase is based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level of variable rate debt and constant interest rate based on the variable rates in place as of december  as discussed above under the heading convertible subordinated notes  we have recorded the fair value of the derivative convertible subordinated note instrument due to our obligation to settle dividends in cash upon conversion of the convertible subordinated notes 
at each subsequent reporting date  we will measure the estimated fair value of the derivative financial instrument  and any increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the derivative liability is recognized immediately in earnings 
we measure the fair value of the option using the following assumptions february  as the expiration of the instrument  as the risk free rate of return  our common stock price as of last trading date in the year  and estimated volatility of our common stock price during the expected term  which was measured based on several factors  including the limited history of our stock price and the deep out of the money conversion price 
changes in these assumptions can significantly change the estimated fair value of the derivative 
assuming a hypothetical increase of in our common stock price while holding all other valuation assumptions unchanged  the estimated fair value of the derivative liability would increase and income before taxes would decrease by
