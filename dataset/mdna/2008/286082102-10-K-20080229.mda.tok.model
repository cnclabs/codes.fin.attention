item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of 
table of contents operations  and part ii  item a  controls and procedures of our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   filed with the sec on october  the independent investigation of our historical stock option practices and resulting restatement activities required us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting  legal and other expenses totaling million in as a result of the events described above  we have become subject to a number of significant risks  each of which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  described below 
see item a we face risks related to possible sec and regulatory actions regarding our historical stock option grant practices  which could require significant management time and attention  and could require us to pay fines or other penalties  and we face litigation risks relating to our stock option grant practices that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operation and cash flow 
we face risks related to possible sec and regulatory actions regarding our historical stock option grant practices  which could require significant management time and attention  and could require us to pay fines or other penalties 
in connection with the special committee investigation of our historical stock option grant practices and related informal inquiry by the securities and exchange commission sec  we voluntarily continued to keep the sec advised of the issues identified during the investigation  its progress and our conclusions 
although no formal inquiry has been made by any regulatory agency with respect to the investigation and the related restatement  we are unable to predict whether any such formal inquiry will be initiated or what consequences  if any  that any such further inquiry may have on us 
any regulatory inquiry could result in substantial legal expenses  divert management s attention from other business concerns and harm our business 
if a regulatory agency were to commence legal action  it is possible that we could be required to pay significant penalties and or fines and could become subject to administrative orders 
any regulatory action could result in the filing of additional restatements of our prior financial statements or require that we take other actions 
we believe our filings comply with all applicable requirements 
nevertheless  the issues surrounding our historical stock option grant practices are complex and the regulatory guidelines or requirements continue to evolve 
there can be no assurance that further sec or other requirements will not evolve or that we will not be required to further restate our prior financial statements 
in addition to the cost and time to amend financial reports  such amendments may have a materially adverse effect on investors and the price of our common stock and could result in a delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global select market 
we face litigation risks relating to our stock option grant practices that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operation and cash flow 
a number of purported shareholder derivative complaints have been filed against us in connection with our historical stock option grant practices 
the complaints allege  among other things  that certain of our current and past officers and directors breached their fiduciary duty to the company by improperly backdating certain grants of stock options to officers and directors of the company and violating the terms of our stock option plans  violating generally accepted accounting practices and producing and disseminating statements that improperly accounted for the options and concealed the alleged backdating 
see part i  item  legal proceedings  for a further description of these proceedings 
the defense of these lawsuits has resulted  and will likely result in the future  in significant expense and the continued diversion of management s time and attention from the operation of our business  which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives 
an unfavorable outcome in any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we retain employment practices liability and director and officer liability insurance but there can be no guarantee that such 
table of contents insurance will cover the claims that are made or will insure us fully for all losses on covered claims 
under our bylaws  charter and indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our officers  directors and general counsel  we are required  subject to certain limited qualifications  to indemnify  and advance expenses to  our current and former executive officers  directors and general counsel in connection with their participation in proceedings arising out of their service to us 
there can be no assurance that such payments in connection with the derivative actions will not be material 
additionally  in the future  we may be the subject of additional private or government actions related to our option grant practices 
litigation is time consuming  expensive and disruptive to normal business operations  and the outcome of litigation  as well as its costs  are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we rely on sales to a relatively small number of oem customers and the loss of any of these oem customers could substantially decrease our revenues 
a significant portion of our revenues are and have been generated by sales of our printer and copier related products to a relatively small number of oems 
for example  canon and xerox each contributed over of our revenues for the year ended december  and together accounted for approximately of those revenues during the same period 
during the fiscal year ended december   canon and xerox each contributed over of our revenues for the year ended december  and together accounted for approximately of those revenues for the year 
because sales of our printer and copier related products constitute a significant portion of our revenues and there is a limited number of oems producing copiers and printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us  we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of oem customers for a significant portion of our controller revenues in future periods 
in addition  our oem customers have developed  and may continue to develop  their own controller products  which may compete directly with our products  which may adversely affect our revenues 
accordingly  if we lose or experience reduced sales to an important oem customer  we will have difficulty replacing the revenue previously generated from such customers with sales to new or existing oem customers and our controller revenue will likely decline significantly 
the market for our super wide format printers is very competitive 
the printing equipment industry is extremely competitive 
our vutek products compete against several companies that market digital printing systems based on electrostatic  drop on demand and continuous drop on demand inkjet  airbrush and other technologies and printers utilizing solvent and uv curable ink 
two of our largest competitors  nur and scitex vision  were acquired by hewlett packard hp and another large competitor  inca  was acquired by dai nippon screen screen 
both hp and screen have greater resources to develop new products and technologies and market those products  as well as acquire or develop critical components at lower costs  which would provide a competitive advantage 
they could also exert downward pressure on product pricing to gain market share 
we have also witnessed the recent growth of local chinese and korean markets where local competitors are developing  manufacturing and selling inexpensive printers  mainly to the local chinese and korean markets 
these chinese and korean manufacturers have also begun penetrating the international market and have partnered with other super wide format printer manufacturers 
our ability to compete depends on factors both within and outside of our control  including the price  performance and acceptance of our current printers and any products we develop in the future 
we also face competition from existing conventional wide format and super wide format printing methods  including screen printing and offset printing 
our competitors could develop new products  with existing or new technology  that could be more competitive in our market than our printers 
we cannot assure you that we can compete effectively with any such products 

table of contents we face strong competition in the market for printing supplies such as ink 
we compete with independent manufacturers in the ink market 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to remain the exclusive or even principal ink supplier for our printers 
the loss of ink sales to our installed base of printers could adversely impact our revenues and gross margins 
we could also experience an overall reduction in price within the ink markets  which would also adversely affect our gross margins 
solvent inks are relatively easy to replicate and additional manufacturers could increase pricing competition or divert customers away from us 
we do not typically have long term purchase contracts with our oem customers and our oem customers have in the past and could at any time in the future  reduce or cease purchasing products from us  harming our operating results and business 
with the exception of certain minimum purchase obligations  we typically do not have long term volume purchase contracts with our oem customers  including canon  xerox and konica minolta and they are not obligated to purchase products from us 
accordingly  our customers could at any time reduce their purchases from us or cease purchasing our products altogether 
in the past  some of our oem customers have elected to develop products on their own  rather than rely  solely or partially  on our products and we expect that customers will continue to make such elections in the future 
in addition  because our oem customers incorporate our products into products they manufacture and sell  any decline in demand for copiers or laser printers and any other negative developments affecting our major customers or the computer industry in general  including reduced demand for the products sold by our oem customers  would likely harm our results of operations 
for example  certain customers have in the past experienced serious financial difficulties which led to a decline in sales of our products to these customers 
if any significant customers should face such difficulties in the future  our operating results could be harmed through  among other things  decreased sales volumes and write offs of accounts receivables and inventory related to products we have manufactured for these customers products 
in addition  a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in advance based on projected sales levels and margins  sales forecasts from our oem customers and product development programs 
a substantial portion of our backlog is scheduled for delivery within days or less and our customers may cancel orders and change volume levels or delivery times for product they have ordered from us without penalty 
accordingly  if sales to our oem customers are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall in revenues on operating results may be and have been increased by our inability to adjust spending in the short term to compensate for this shortfall 
we rely on our oem customers to develop and sell products incorporating our controller technologies and if they fail to successfully develop and sell these products  or curtail or cease the use of our technologies in their products  our business will be harmed 
we rely upon our oem customers to develop new products  applications and product enhancements utilizing our controller technologies in a timely and cost effective manner 
our continued success in the controller industry depends upon the ability of these oem customers to utilize our technologies while meeting changing end user customer needs and responding to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
however  we cannot provide assurance that our oem customers will effectively meet these challenges 
these oem customers are generally not obligated to purchase products from us and we cannot provide assurance that they will continue to carry our products 
for example  our oem customers have incorporated into their products the technologies of other companies or internally developed technologies in addition to  or instead of  our technologies and will likely continue to do so in the future 
if our oem customers do not effectively and successfully market products containing our technologies  our revenue will likely be materially and adversely affected 
our oem customers work closely with us to develop products that are specific to each oem customer s copiers and printers 
many of the products and technologies we are developing require that we coordinate development  
table of contents quality testing  marketing and other tasks with our oem customers 
we cannot control our oem customers development efforts or the timing of these efforts and coordinating with our oem customers may cause delays in our own product development efforts that are outside of our control 
if our oem customers delay the release of their products  our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot meet our oem customers product needs for their specific copiers and printers  as well as successfully manage the additional engineering and support effort and other risks associated with such a wide range of products 
ongoing economic uncertainty has had and may continue to have a negative effect on our business 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends significantly on the overall demand for information technology products that enable printing of digital data  which in turn depends on a variety of macro and micro economic conditions 
in addition  our revenue growth and profitability in our inkjet business depends on demand and spending for advertising and marketing products and programs  which also depends on a variety of macro and micro economic conditions 
delays or reductions in information technology spending  which has occurred in the past  could cause a decline in demand for our products and services and consequently harm our business  operating results  financial condition  prospects and stock price 
our operating results may fluctuate based upon many factors  which could adversely affect our stock price 
stock prices of high technology companies such as ours tend to be volatile as a result of various factors  including variations in operating results and  consequently  fluctuations in our operating results could adversely affect our stock price 
factors that have caused our operating results and stock price to fluctuate in the past and that may cause future fluctuations include varying demand for our products  due to seasonality  oem customer product development and marketing efforts  oem customer financial and operational condition  oem inventory management practices and general economic conditions  shifts in customer demand to lower cost products  success and timing of new product introductions by us and our oem customers and the performance of our products generally  success and timing of new inkjet product introductions  volatility in foreign exchange rates  changes in interest rates and availability of bank or financing credit to consumers of digital copiers and printers  price reductions by us and our competitors  which may be exacerbated by competitive pressures caused by economic conditions generally  substitution of third party inks for our own ink products by users of our super wide format inkjet printers  delay  cancellation or rescheduling of orders or projects  delays or shortages of supply of our key components  including without limitation inkjet print heads  and inability of our suppliers to meet our requirements  availability of key components and licenses  including possible delays in deliveries from suppliers  the performance of third party manufacturers and the status of our relationships with our key suppliers  potential excess or shortage of employees and location of research and development centers  changes in our product mix such as shifts from higher revenue or gross margin products to lower revenue or gross margin products such as our inkjet products  
table of contents costs associated with complying with any applicable governmental regulations  cost associated with possible sec and regulatory actions regarding our historical stock option granting practices and remedial measures we are taking with respect to our historical stock option granting practices  acquisitions and integration of new businesses  costs related to our entry into new markets  such as commercial printing and office equipment service automation  general economic conditions  commencement of litigation or adverse results in pending litigation  including the purported shareholder derivative suits related to our historical stock option granting practices  and other risks described herein 
we face competition from other suppliers as well as our own oem customers and if we are not able to compete successfully our business may be harmed 
the digital printing marketplace is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological changes 
we compete against a number of other suppliers of imaging products and technologies  including our oem customers themselves 
although we attempt to develop and support innovative products that end users demand  products or technologies developed by competing suppliers  including our own oem customers  could render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
while many of our oem customers incorporate our technologies into their end products on an exclusive basis  we do not have any formal agreements that prevent these oem customers from offering alternative products that do not incorporate our technologies 
if  as has occurred in the past  an oem customer offers products incorporating technology from alternative suppliers instead of  or in addition to  products incorporating our technologies  our market share could decrease  which would likely reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  many oems in the printer and copier industry  including most of our oem customers  internally develop and sell products that compete directly with our current products 
these oems have significant investments in their existing solutions and have substantial resources that may enable them to develop or improve  more quickly than us  technologies similar to ours that are compatible with their own products 
our oem customers have in the past marketed  and likely will continue in the future to market  their own internal technologies and solutions in addition to ours  even when their technologies and solutions are less advanced  have lower performance or cost more than our products 
given the significant financial  marketing and other resources of our larger oem customers and other significant oems in the imaging industry who are not our customers  we may not be able to successfully compete against these oems selling similar products that they develop internally 
if we cannot compete successfully against the oems internally developed products  we will lose sales and market share in those areas where the oems choose to compete and our business will be harmed 
price reductions for all of our products may affect our revenues in the future 
we have made and may in the future make price reductions for our products in order to drive demand and remain competitive 
depending upon the price elasticity of demand for our products  the pricing and quality of competitive products and other economic and competitive conditions  such price reductions may have an adverse impact on our revenues and profits 
if we are not able to compensate for lower gross margins that may result from price reductions with an increased volume of sales  our results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents entry into new markets or distribution channels could result in higher operating expenses that may not be offset by increased revenue 
we continue to explore opportunities to develop or acquire product lines different from our current controllers  such as print management software  document scanning solutions and inkjet printers 
we expect to continue to invest funds to develop new distribution and marketing channels for these and additional new products and services  which will increase our operating expenses 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing these channels or whether the market will accept any of our new products or services or if we will generate sufficient revenues from these activities to offset the additional operating expenses we incur 
in addition  even if we are able to introduce new products or services  if customers do not accept these new products or services or if we are not able to price such products or services competitively  our operating results will likely suffer 
we license software used in most of our products from adobe systems incorporated and the loss of this license would prevent us from shipping these products 
many of our current products include software that we must license from adobe 
specifically  we are required to obtain separate licenses from adobe for the right to use adobe postscript software in each type of copier or printer used with a fiery controller 
although to date we have successfully obtained licenses to use adobe s postscript software when required  adobe is not required to  and we cannot be certain that adobe will  grant future licenses to adobe postscript software on reasonable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  in order to obtain licenses from adobe  adobe requires that we obtain from them quality assurance approvals for our products that use adobe software 
although to date we have successfully obtained such quality assurances from adobe  we cannot be certain adobe will grant us such approvals in the future 
if adobe does not grant us such licenses or approvals  if the adobe licenses are terminated  or if our relationship with adobe is otherwise materially impaired  we would likely be unable to sell products that incorporate adobe postscript software and our financial condition and results of operations would be significantly harmed 
we depend upon a limited group of suppliers for key components in our products 
the loss of any of these suppliers  the inability of any of these suppliers to meet our requirements  or the delays or shortages of supply of these components could adversely affect our business 
certain components necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
these include processors from intel and other related semiconductor components and inkjet print heads for our super wide format printers 
we do not maintain long term agreements with any of our component suppliers and conduct our business with such suppliers solely on a purchase order basis 
if we are unable to continue to procure these sole sourced components from our current suppliers in the required quantities  we will have to qualify other sources  if possible  or design our products so that they no longer require these components 
in addition  these suppliers may be concentrated within similar industries or geographic locations  which could potentially exacerbate these risks 
we cannot provide assurance that other sources of these components exist or will be willing to supply us on reasonable terms or at all  or that we will be able to design around these components 
therefore any unavailability  delays or shortages of supply of these components or any inability of our suppliers to meet our requirements could harm our business 
because the purchase of certain key components involves long lead times  in the event of unanticipated volatility in demand for our products  we have been in the past and may in the future be unable to manufacture certain products in a quantity sufficient to meet demand 
further  as has occurred in the past  in the event that anticipated demand does not materialize  we may hold excess quantities of inventory that could become obsolete 
in order to meet projected demand  we maintain an inventory of components for which we are dependent upon sole or limited source suppliers and components with prices that fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we are subject to a risk of inventory obsolescence  which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
additionally  the market prices and availability of certain components  particularly memory and intel designed components  which collectively represent a substantial portion of the total manufactured cost of our products  have fluctuated significantly in the past 
such fluctuations in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including a reduction in gross margins 

table of contents we are dependent on a limited number of subcontractors  with whom we do not have long term contracts  to manufacture and deliver products to our customers and the loss of any of these subcontractors could adversely affect our business 
we subcontract with other companies to manufacture our products and we do not have long term agreements with these subcontractors 
we rely on the ability of our subcontractors to produce products to be sold to our customers and while we closely monitor our subcontractors performance we cannot assure you that such subcontractors will continue to manufacture our products in a timely and effective manner 
in the past a weakened economy led to the dissolution  bankruptcy or consolidation of some of the subcontractors who are able to manufacture our products  decreasing the available number of subcontractors 
if the available number of subcontractors were to again decrease  it is possible that we would not be able to secure appropriate subcontractors to fulfill our demand in a timely manner or at all  particularly if demand for our products increases 
the existence of fewer subcontractors may also reduce our negotiating leverage potentially resulting in higher product costs 
difficulties experienced by our subcontractors  including financial problems and the inability to make or ship our products or fix quality assurance problems  could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we decide to change subcontractors  we could experience delays in finding  qualifying and commencing business with new subcontractors which would result in both delay in delivery of our products and also potentially the cancellation of orders for our products 
a high concentration of our fiery controllers is manufactured at a single subcontractor location  celestica in toronto  ontario  canada 
should celestica experience any inability to  or refuse to  manufacture or deliver product from this location our business  financial condition and operations could be harmed 
since we do not maintain long term agreements with our subcontractors  any of our subcontractors could enter into agreements with our competitors that might restrict or prohibit such subcontractors from manufacturing our products or could otherwise lead to an inability of such subcontractors from filling our orders in a timely manner 
in such event  we may not be able to find suitable replacement subcontractors and our business  financial condition and operations would likely be harmed 
we may face increased risk of inventory obsolescence related to our super wide format inkjet printers and ink 
we procure raw materials and build our super wide printers and ink products based on our sales forecasts 
if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products we may end up with excess inventory  or we may lose sales because we do not have the correct products available for sale 
if we have excess printers or other products we may have to lower prices to stimulate demand 
we may also run the risk that our inventory of raw materials may become obsolete 
our ink products have a defined shelf life 
if we do not sell the ink before the end of its shelf life it will no longer be sellable and will have to be expensed 
if we are not able to hire and retain skilled employees  we may not be able to develop products or meet demand for our products in a timely fashion 
we depend upon skilled employees  such as software and hardware engineers  quality assurance engineers and other technical professionals with specialized skills 
we are headquartered in the silicon valley and additionally have research and development offices in india 
competition in both locations has historically been intense amongst companies hiring engineering and technical professionals 
in times of professional labor imbalances  it has in the past and is likely in the future to be difficult for us to locate and hire qualified engineers and technical professionals and for us to retain these people 
there are many technology companies located near our corporate offices in the silicon valley and our operations in india that may try to hire our employees 
the movement of our stock price may also impact our ability to hire and retain employees 
if we do not offer competitive compensation  we may not be able to recruit or retain employees 
we offer a broad based equity compensation plan based on granting options and restricted stock from stockholder approved plans in order to be competitive in the labor market 
if we cannot offer equity awards when necessary to enable us to offer compensation competitive with those offered by other companies seeking the same employees  it may be difficult for us to hire and retain skilled employees 

table of contents our acquisition of vutek in june and jetrion in october increased the chance that we will experience additional bad debt expense 
our oem customers are typically large profitable customers who present little credit risk to us 
our apps and inkjet businesses sell primarily via a direct sales force to a broader base of customers  many of whom are smaller and potentially less credit worthy 
in addition  as we continue to increase our revenues from our inkjet customers  many of whom are located overseas in many countries  it may be hard to enforce our legal rights should collection issues arise 
because of our recent acquisitions we now sell our products to distributors and directly to the end user 
if we are unable to effectively manage a direct sales force  sales and revenues could decline 
we have traditionally sold our products to our oem partners  who in turn sold the product to the end user 
our marketing focused on manufacturers and distributors of the manufacturers equipment  not on the end user of the product 
we now sell our professional printing applications and our inkjet printers and ink to distributors and directly to the end user 
if we are unable to effectively manage a direct sales force and develop a marketing program that can reach the end users  we are likely to see a decline in revenues from those products 
we have made acquisitions that are dilutive to existing stockholders 
acquisitions may result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses 
we seek to develop new technologies and products from both internal and external sources 
as part of this effort  we have in the past made  and will likely continue to make  acquisitions of other companies or other companies assets 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  such as if we issue equity securities in connection with an acquisition  the issuance may be dilutive to our existing stockholders  alternatively  acquisitions made entirely or partially for cash such as our acquisition of vutek will reduce our cash reserves  difficulties in integration of operations  employees  technologies  or products and the related diversion of management time and effort to accomplish successful integration  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  or entering markets where competitors have stronger market positions  possible write downs of impaired assets  
table of contents potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  possible expense overruns  an adverse reaction by customers  suppliers or partners of the acquired company or efi  the risk of changes in ratings by stock analysts  potential litigation surrounding transactions or the prior actions of the acquired company  such as the vutek patent lawsuit and bureau of industry and security bis export investigation  the inability to protect or secure technology rights  increases in operating costs  and potential violation of covenants associated with our convertible senior debentures 
mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and we cannot provide assurance that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not harm our business  operating results  financial condition  or stock price 
we face risks from currency fluctuations 
approximately million and million of our revenue from the sale of products for the years ended december  and  respectively  came from sales outside the americas  primarily to europe and japan 
we expect that sales outside the americas will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
given the significance of our non us sales to our total product revenue  we face a continuing risk from the fluctuation of the us dollar versus the japanese yen  the euro and other major european currencies and numerous southeast asian currencies 
we typically quote and invoice our customers in us dollars and this may result in our products becoming more expensive in the local currency of our customers  thereby reducing our ability to sell our products 
when we do invoice our customers in local currencies  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates between the currency of the invoice and the us dollar 
in addition  we have a substantial number of international employees which creates material operating costs denominated in foreign currencies 
in europe  where we have a significant presence  our sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses have increased in part due to the weakened us dollar 
we have attempted to limit or hedge these exposures through operational strategies where we have considered it appropriate in the past  although no hedging activities occurred in our efforts to reduce the risk from our international operations and from fluctuations in foreign currencies or interest rates may not be successful  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we believe that the impact from currency exchange differences in was not material 
we face risks from our international operations 
we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations 
changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations that may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales 
trade legislation in either the united states or other countries  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export compliance laws or other trade policies  could adversely affect our ability to sell or to manufacture in international markets 
some of our sales to international customers are made under export licenses that must be obtained from the united states department of commerce doc and certain transactions require prior approval of the doc 
changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals  permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues  business and operations 
any violations could result in fines and penalties  including prohibiting us from exporting our products to one or more countries  and could materially and adversely affect our business 

table of contents moreover  local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the united states 
we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations  which may be substantially different from those in the united states 
in many foreign countries  particularly in those with developing economies  it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by united states regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act 
although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws  there can be no assurance that all of our employees  contractors and agents  as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations  including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such united states laws may be customary  will not take actions in violation of our policies 
any such violation  even if prohibited by our policies  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
other risks include natural disasters and political or economic conditions in a specific country or region 
in addition  many countries in which we derive revenues do not currently have comprehensive and highly developed legal systems  particularly with respect to the protection of intellectual property rights  which  among other things  can result in the prevalence of infringing products and counterfeit goods in certain countries  which could harm our business and reputation 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information and may incur expenses to defend our proprietary information 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret protection  nondisclosure agreements and licensing and cross licensing arrangements to establish  maintain and protect our intellectual property rights  all of which afford only limited protection 
we have patents and pending patent applications in the united states and in various foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from our pending applications or from any future applications  or that  if issued  any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
any failure to adequately protect our proprietary information could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we cannot be certain that any patents that have been or may in the future be issued to us  or which we license from third parties  or any other of our proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  we cannot be certain that any rights granted to us under any patents  licenses or other proprietary rights will provide adequate protection of our proprietary information 
in addition  as different areas of our business change or mature  from time to time we evaluate our patent portfolio and make decisions either to pursue or not to pursue specific patents and patent applications related to such areas 
choosing not to pursue certain of our patents  patentable applications and failing to file applications for potentially patentable inventions  may harm our business by  among other things  enabling our competitors to more effectively compete with us  reducing the potential claims we can bring against third parties for patent infringement and limiting our potential defenses to intellectual property claims brought by third parties 
litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to defend and enforce our proprietary rights 
such litigation  whether or not concluded successfully for us  could involve significant expense and the diversion of our attention and other resources  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we face risks from third party claims of infringement and potential litigation 
third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that our products infringe  or may infringe  their proprietary rights 
such claims have in the past resulted in lengthy and expensive litigation and could do so in the future 
such claims and any related litigation  whether or not we are successful in the litigation  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing  we cannot assure you that any such licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 

table of contents we may be subject to environmental related liabilities due to our use of hazardous materials and solvents 
we conduct our business operations that involve the use of certain hazardous materials at two separate locations 
at these facilities  we mix ink used in some of our printers with solvents and other hazardous materials 
those materials are subject to various governmental regulations relating to their transfer  handling  packaging  use and disposal 
we store the ink at warehouses worldwide  including europe and the united states  and shipping companies ship it at our direction 
we face potential responsibility for problems such as spills that may arise when we ship the ink to customers 
while we customarily obtain insurance coverage typical for this kind of risk  if we fail to comply with these laws or an accident involving our ink waste or solvents occurs  then our business and financial results could be harmed 
future sales of our hardware products in european union member countries eu could be limited due to the enactment of the eu restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs 
since july  forward  new electrical and electronic equipment sold in the eu must not contain lead  mercury  cadmium  hexavalent chromium  polybrominated biphenyls pbbs or polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes 
these must be replaced by other non or less than toxic substances 
manufacturers must comply with significant  and potentially costly  compliance requirements in order to meet the rohs deadline 
some of our products may not have been converted before the deadline 
as a result  we may not be allowed to sell those products in the eu until the products are made fully compliant  which could harm our business and financial results we could also incur additional costs and liabilities in connection with non compliant product recalls  regulatory fines and exclusion of non compliant products from certain markets 
our products may contain defects which are not discovered until after shipping 
our products consist of hardware and software developed by ourselves and others 
our products may contain undetected errors and we have in the past discovered software and hardware errors in certain of our products after their introduction  resulting in warranty expense and other expenses incurred in connection with rectifying such errors 
errors could be found in new versions of our products after commencement of commercial shipment and any such errors could result in a loss or delay in market acceptance of such products and thus harm our reputation and revenues 
in addition  errors in our products including errors in licensed third party software detected prior to new product releases could result in delays in the introduction of new products and our incurring additional expense  which could harm our operating results 
we currently provide a twelve month warranty for certain products  which may cover both parts and labor 
in the future  we may incur substantial warranty claim expenses on our products which may exceed our estimated warranty reserves  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could adversely affect our revenues 
maintaining the security of our software and hardware products is an issue of critical importance to our customers and for us 
there are individuals and groups who develop and deploy viruses  worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products 
although we take preventative measures to protect our products  and we have a response team that is notified of high risk malicious events  these procedures may not be sufficient to mitigate damage to our products 
actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products  to reduce or delay future purchases or to purchase competitive products 
customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their computer systems from attack  which could delay or reduce purchases of our products 
any of these actions or responses by customers could adversely affect our revenues 

table of contents system failures or system unavailability could harm our business 
we rely on our network infrastructure  internal technology systems and our internal and external websites for our development  marketing  operational  support and sales activities 
our hardware and software systems related to such activities are subject to damage from malicious code released into the public internet through recently discovered vulnerabilities in popular software programs 
these systems are also subject to acts of vandalism and to potential disruption by actions or inactions of third parties 
any event that causes failures or interruption in our hardware or software systems could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
the location and concentration of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquakes  floods or other natural disasters and public health risks 
our corporate headquarters  including most of our research and development facilities  are located in the san francisco bay area  an area known for seismic activity 
this area has also experienced flooding in the past 
in addition  many of the components necessary to supply our products are purchased from suppliers based in areas including the san francisco bay area  taiwan and japan and are therefore subject to risk from natural disasters 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake  flood or typhoon  could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
our employees  suppliers and customers are located worldwide 
we face the risk that our employees  suppliers  or customers  either through travel or contact with other individuals  could become exposed to contagious diseases endemic to particular regions of the world 
in addition  governments in those regions have from time to time imposed quarantines and taken other actions in response to contagious diseases that could affect our operations 
if a significant number of employees  suppliers  or customers were unable to fulfill their obligations  due to contagious diseases  actions taken in response to contagious diseases  or other reasons  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
we are subject to numerous federal and state employment laws and may face claims in the future under such laws 
we are subject to numerous federal and state employment laws  and from time to time we face claims by our employees and former employees under such laws 
in addition  the number of cases involving alleged violations of the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws has recently increased in the software industry 
the outcome of these types of cases is highly fact specific and the law  particularly in california  is still evolving 
although there are no pending or threatened claims under wage and hour laws against us  we cannot assure you that claims under such laws or other employment related laws will not be attempted in the future against us  nor can we predict the likely impact of any such claims on us  or that  if asserted  we would be able to successfully resolve any such claims without incurring significant expenses 
we may be subject to the risk of loss due to fire because the materials we use in the manufacturing process of our inks are flammable 
we use flammable materials in the manufacturing processes of our inks and may therefore be subject to the risk of loss arising from fires 
the risk of fire associated with these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
we own certain facilities that manufacture our inks  which increases our exposure to such risk in case these facilities are destroyed 
we maintain insurance policies to reduce losses caused by fire  including business interruption insurance 
if one or more of these facilities is damaged or otherwise ceases operations as a result of a fire  it would reduce manufacturing capacity and  consequently  may reduce revenues and adversely affect our business 
the value of our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate volatility 
we have an investment portfolio of mainly fixed income securities classified as available for sale securities 
as a result  our investment portfolio is subject to volatility if market interest rates fluctuate 
we attempt to limit this 
table of contents exposure to interest rate risk by investing in securities with maturities of less than three years  however  we may be unable to successfully limit our risk to interest rate fluctuations and this may cause volatility in our investment portfolio value 
our stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
for example  during the twelve month period ended december   the price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market ranged from a low of to a high of 
we expect our stock price to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors  including factors beyond our control 
these factors include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual operating results  our failure to meet analyst expectations  announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors  announcements relating to strategic relationships  acquisitions or investments  announcements by our customers regarding their businesses or the products in which our products are included  changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts  changes in general economic conditions  terrorist attacks and the effects of military engagements or natural disasters  changes in the rating of our debentures or other securities  changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other software and high technology companies  commencement of litigation or adverse results in pending litigation  including purported shareholder derivative suits related to our historical stock option practices  commencement of possible sec and regulatory actions regarding our historical stock option grant practices  and because of this volatility  we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts from time to time and the trading prices of our securities could decline as a result 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many high technology companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
any negative change in the public s perception of high technology companies could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 
our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility 
any repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility 
there can be no assurance that the repurchases will be made at the best possible price 
the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock 
additionally  we are permitted to and could discontinue our stock repurchase program at any time and any such discontinuation could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
for example  we suspended our stock repurchase program as the result of being unable to timely file our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  we resumed our stock repurchase program in october 
table of contents under regulations required by the sarbanes oxley act of  an adverse opinion on internal controls over financial reporting could be issued by our auditors  and this could have a negative impact on our stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting and assess on an on going basis the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
our auditors  an independent registered public accounting firm  are required to audit the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
although no known material weaknesses are believed to exist at this time  it is possible that material weaknesses could be identified 
if we are unable to remediate the weaknesses  our management would be required to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective and our auditors would be required to issue an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
it is uncertain what impact such adverse conclusions would have on our stock price 
in addition to their inherent limitations  internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements  errors  omissions  or fraud 
a reduction in our net income as reported on our financial statements could increase the likelihood of identifying a material weakness in our internal controls 
the threshold for determining whether or not we have a material weakness in our internal controls and procedures as defined by the sarbanes oxley act is  in part  based on our generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  net income 
lowered gaap net income  with an associated lowered materiality threshold  may increase our risk of having to disclose control weaknesses 
for example  continued acquisitions  and the associated amortization of intangibles  will increase our amortization expenses and in the future may lower our gaap earnings which would result in a lower materiality threshold for internal control testing 
a lower materiality threshold requires us to test more areas of the business 
as the number of areas tested increases  the statistical chance of discovering a material weakness increases 
our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
in june  we issued million in convertible senior debentures due in during the period the debentures are outstanding  we will have debt service obligations on the debentures of approximately million per year in interest payments  payable semi annually 
in addition  beginning june   we could be required to pay contingent interest of if during any nine month period from june to november and december to may  the average market price of the debentures for the five trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the relevant nine month period equals or more of the principal amount of the debentures 
our debt service obligations related to the debentures include the following redemption and repurchase terms that could also affect our cash position on or after june   we may redeem the debentures for cash at any time as a whole  or from time to time in part  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debenture to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any  on june  a holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of that holder s debentures at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of those debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any  to  but not including  the date of repurchase in cash  and a holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of that holder s debentures if a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  occurs prior to june  at of their principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any to  but not including  the repurchase date 
we may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash 
if we issue other debt securities in the future  our debt service obligations will increase 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations  if any  and from our existing cash and investments 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or 
table of contents investments  we may have to reduce  curtail or terminate other activities of our business 
we may add lines of credit and obtain other long term debt and mortgage financing to finance capital expenditures in the future 
for example  if we exercise our option to redeem the million in convertible senior debentures or if the holders require us to repurchase all or a significant portion of the convertible senior debentures  we believe we may need to seek alternative sources of liquidity 
this may include adding a line of credit and or converting all or portions of our investment portfolio into cash 
in either case  we would expect that our other income would decline due to the impact of higher interest costs on any new debt or lower expected interest income earned on our investment portfolio 
our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  as we are required to make interest payments and maintain compliance with financial covenants contained in the debentures regardless of such external conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing due to covenants contained in the debentures and the existing leverage evidenced by the debentures  require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of and interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our growth strategy  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry by restricting the funds available for use in addressing such changes  and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt

item legal proceedings legal proceedings as more fully discussed below  from time to time  we may be involved in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations and proceedings relating to contractual disputes  securities law  intellectual property  employment matters and other claims or litigation matters relating to various claims that arise in the normal course of our business 
we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we assess our potential liability by analyzing our specific litigation and regulatory matters using available information 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with inside and outside counsel  which involves a subjective analysis of potential results and outcomes  assuming various combinations of appropriate litigation and settlement strategies 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and ranges of possible loss on the pending litigation matters  we are unable to predict with certainty the precise liability that could finally result from a range of possible unfavorable outcomes 
however  taking all of the above factors into account  we reserve an amount that we could reasonably expect to pay for the cases discussed 
however  our estimates could be wrong  and we could pay more or less than our current accrual

leggett platt  inc and l p property management company v 
vutek  inc in may  prior to efi s acquisition of vutek  leggett platt  inc l p  and its patent holding subsidiary brought a patent infringement action against vutek in the united states district court in the eastern district of missouri 
after conducting extensive discovery  efi moved for summary judgment that the asserted patent is invalid and not infringed 
after several months of reviewing the evidence  on december   the court granted efi s summary judgment motion and ruled that all of l p s asserted patent claims were invalid on multiple grounds 
the court found that each asserted patent claim was obvious and already disclosed in vutek s own prior patents 
in addition to those two grounds for invalidity  the court also found l p s patent claims invalid because the l p patent claims were vague and indefinite in view of the patent claim interpretations suggested by l p 
the court also granted efi s motion to recover its costs from l p 
l p presently is appealing the judgment  and efi is fully opposing l p s appeal 
on november   efi filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the validity and enforceability of l p s newly issued patent  which is a continuation of l p s originally asserted patent 
efi firmly believes that the court should summarily invalidate the claims of this patent for the same reasons it invalidated the l p s original patent claims 
further  efi believes that l p s failure to adequately disclose to the us patent and trademark office the proceedings in the previous lawsuit amounts to inequitable conduct that should render the new patent unenforceable 
while efi does not believe that its products infringed either of these patents  due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of this litigation 

table of contents bureau of industry and security bis export investigation in january  prior to efi s acquisition of vutek  the us commerce department s bureau of industry and security initiated an investigation of vutek relating to vutek s alleged failure to comply with us export regulations in connection with several export sales to syria in efi self initiated an internal compliance review of historical export practices for both vutek and efi 
potential violations uncovered during our compliance review were voluntarily disclosed to bis in november for vutek and december for efi 
additionally  we provided bis with detailed reports of our compliance review findings and supplemental information in march for vutek and may for efi 
the areas of possible non compliance found in the internal review relate to deemed exports of controlled encryption source code and or technology to foreign nationals of syria and iran  exports of printers and other products with encryption functionality before completion of encryption reviews by bis and statistical reporting errors on some export declarations 
at present  we believe that these matters will be resolved solely with administrative penalties 
however  there is no assurance that these matters will not have an unforeseen outcome that could impair our ability to export product outside of the united states and canada

the third category  advanced professional print software  or apps  consists of software technology focused on printing workflow  print management information systems  proofing and web submission and job tracking tools and software options available on our controller products 

table of contents our revenues by product category for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands years ended december  change revenue over over controllers inkjet products advanced professional printing software total revenue overview revenue was million in  compared to million in and million in  which resulted in a increase in versus and a increase in versus the million increase in compared to was primarily due to a million increase in inkjet product revenues  and a million increase in apps revenues 
controllers revenue declined slightly in compared to controllers revenues in our controllers category  revenue declined slightly in versus primarily because of a focus by our oem partners on end of year inventory management and weakness in sales into our core professional print market 
the decrease in versus of million was primarily due to the sale of the mwa business in the second quarter of which contributed a million decline in revenue year over year 
inkjet products revenues inkjet product revenues were million in as compared to million in the increase is due to the continued success of vutek s qs series of uv printers  driven by continued robust demand in europe  middle east and africa emea and the americas 
inkjet product revenues were million in as compared to million in our results include seven months of vutek revenues since its acquisition in june and our results include months of jetrion revenues and a full year of vutek revenues 
we estimate that inkjet product revenues would have increased on a pro forma basis if revenues included vutek pre acquisition revenues 
approximately million of inkjet product revenues were generated from ink sales versus million in and million in we currently expect our inkjet and ink revenues to increase over the course of as we continue to penetrate existing markets and develop new customer accounts 
advanced professional print software revenues the advanced professional print software category increased in over primarily due to the strength of the software products that complement the controllers business 
the apps category increased in over primarily due to a million increase in revenues from packaged software solutions  which are sold with new controllers and to existing customers 
this category includes our management systems software  
table of contents including efi hagen  efi logic  prograph  printsmith and printflow  our web based order entry and order management software  including digital storefront and our proofing software  colorproof xf 
the software applications in this category generate higher margins  favorably impacting our margins 
revenues by geographic area for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands for the years ended december  change over over americas emea japan other international locations total revenue revenue growth in across all regions was primarily driven by our inkjet products 
in the individual regions  inkjet product revenues in represented    and of revenue in the americas  emea  japan and other international locations  respectively 
in  revenues in the emea region demonstrated increased strength 
in  revenues in the emea  americas and japan regions represented  and of revenues  respectively  while in they represented  and of revenues  respectively 
this represents an increase in the emea region of year over year and decreases in the americas and japan regions of and  respectively  year over year 
the japan region had strong growth due to strong design license sales to oem customers 
revenues in the americas region was negatively impacted by the sale of the mwa product line in the second quarter of shipments to some of our us oem customers are made to centralized purchasing and manufacturing locations  which in turn sell through to other locations 
we believe that non us sales of our products into each region may differ from what is reported because accurate data is difficult to obtain 
we expect that non us sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
a substantial portion of our revenue over the years has been attributable to sales of products through our oem customers and independent distributor channels 
for the year ended december   two customers canon and xerox each provided more than of our revenue individually and approximately of revenue in the aggregate 
for the year ended december   two customers canon and xerox each provided more than of our revenue individually and approximately of revenue in the aggregate 
for the year ended december   canon  konica minolta and xerox each provided more than of our revenue individually and approximately of revenue in the aggregate 
we have shown a continued decrease in our dependency on the oem business and in  of our revenues were from non oem sources 
the decreasing trend in oem dependency is attributable to the addition of the inkjet products business where most of the revenue is generated from sales to distributors and direct customers 
no assurance can be given that our relationships with distributors and direct customers will continue or that we will be successful in maintaining or increasing the number of our oem customers or the size of our existing oem relationships 
several of our oem customers have reduced their purchases from us at various times in the past and any customer could do so in the future as there are no contractual obligations by most of our oems to purchase our products at all  or in significant amounts 
such reductions have occurred in the past and could in the future have a significant negative impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we expect that if we increase our revenues from our inkjet products and our advance professional print software  the percentage of our revenue that comes from individual oems will continue to decrease 

table of contents we continue to develop new products and technologies for each of our product lines including new generations of controllers and controller products and other new product lines and to distribute those new products to or through current and new oem customers  distribution partners  and end users in and beyond 
no assurance can be given that the introduction or market acceptance of current or future products will be successful 
to the extent sales of our products do not grow over time in absolute terms  or if we are not able to meet demand for higher unit volumes  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
there can be no assurance that any products that we introduce in the future will successfully compete  be accepted by the market  or otherwise effectively replace the volume of revenue and or income from our older products 
market acceptance of our software products  products acquired through acquisitions and other products cannot be assured 
we also believe that in addition to the factors described above  price reductions for all of our products may affect revenues in the future 
we have previously reduced and in the future will likely reduce prices for our products 
depending upon the price elasticity of demand for our products  the pricing and quality of competitive products  and other economic and competitive conditions  such price reductions have had and may in the future have an adverse impact on our revenues and profits 
stock based compensation see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of stock based compensation 
gross margins our gross margins were   and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margins in and was due primarily to the greater mix of inkjet sales 
our inkjet printers have a lower gross margin than our controllers and advanced professional print software product lines 
product mix is a significant driver in our gross margins and we cannot predict the impact that product mix will have on future gross margin results 
our inkjet product line is growing as a percentage of revenue which decreases gross margin percentage 
for inkjet revenues were of total revenue as compared to and of total revenues in and  respectively 
gross margins on our inkjet products are lower than gross margins on our controller business 
our ink sales represent a continuing revenue stream to existing customers that will increase if our inkjet customers production increases 
ink margins are typically higher than overall inkjet margins 
if our product mix changes significantly  our gross margins will fluctuate 
in addition  gross margins can be impacted by a variety of other factors 
these factors include the market prices that can be achieved on our current and future products  the availability and pricing of key components including dram  processors  print heads and postscript interpreter software  third party manufacturing costs  product  channel and geographic mix  the success of our product transitions and new products  competition and general economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
consequently  gross margins may fluctuate from period to period 
in addition to the factors affecting revenue described above  if we reduce prices  gross margins for our products could be lower 
our print controllers are manufactured by third party manufacturers who purchase most of the necessary components 
if our third party manufacturers cannot obtain the necessary components at favorable prices  we could experience an increase in our product costs 
we purchase certain parts directly  including processors  memory  certain asics and software licensed from various sources  including postscript interpreter software  which we license from adobe systems incorporated 

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses increased by in over and increased by in over operating expenses as a percentage of revenue totaled   and for   and  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in versus primarily resulted from increases in personnel related costs 
the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in versus was primarily due to a decrease of in process research and development expense ipr d from million in relating to the vutek acquisition to million in relating to the jetrion acquisition 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with personnel  consulting and prototype parts 
research and development expenses were million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the increase of million in was primarily due to a million increase in employee costs related to increased headcount as a result of our investments in our research and development organizations  a million increase in consulting fees  a million increase in prototype expenses and a 
million increase in stock based compensation expense and other equity plan related costs 
the increase of million in versus was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation of million  higher personnel and other related costs due to higher headcount  and higher spending due to inkjet research and development 
research and development headcount was and as of december  and  respectively 
we believe that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are essential to our success and we intend to continue to devote substantial resources to research and new product development efforts 
accordingly  we expect that our research and development expenses may increase in absolute terms and also as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
sales and marketing sales and marketing include personnel expenses  costs of trade shows  marketing programs and promotional materials  sales commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  depreciation  and costs associated with sales offices in the united states  europe  asia  and other locations around the world 
sales and marketing expenses for were million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the million increase in expenses in versus is primarily related to a million increase in personnel costs related to increased headcount and related sales commissions attributable to the increase in inkjet sales  a million increase in overhead expenses related to the vutek expansion in the emea region  a million increase in travel related expenses  and a million increase in vutek promotional expenses 
the million increase in expenses in versus primarily related to the acquisition of vutek  which is included in the full year results for and for seven months in vutek sells directly to end user customers which results in a higher level of sales expense compared to our oem customers 
vutek sales and marketing expenses increased by million in from the remaining increases consisted of a increase in stock based compensation expense  from million in to million in sales and marketing headcount was and as of december  and  respectively 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses may increase in absolute terms as we continue to actively promote our products  introduce new products and services  and continue to build our sales and marketing organization  particularly in europe and asia pacific 
sales and marketing expenses may also increase as we continue to grow our software solutions  inkjet products  and other new product lines  which require greater sales and marketing support from us 
we expect that if the us dollar remains volatile against the euro or other currencies  sales and marketing expenses reported in us dollars could fluctuate 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with administrative personnel  legal and accounting expense and stock option investigation costs 
general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue in compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the million increase in versus consists primarily of million in legal and accounting expenses related to the stock option investigation  a million increase in personnel costs as a result of headcount growth to support the growth in the vutek business  a million increase in bad debt expense due to the prior year reversal of the vutek acquisition allowance for doubtful accounts  million in costs related to an acquisition that was not consummated in the first quarter of  and a million increase in personnel costs related to the tax settlement pursuant to section a of the us internal revenue code section a 
the million increase in versus principally consists of an increase of stock based compensation of million from million in to million in  and million incurred in for accounting and legal fees relating to our independent investigation into past stock option practices 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease in absolute terms as we complete activities related to the stock option investigation 
restructuring charges during the first quarter of we incurred severance costs of approximately million related to a headcount reduction of employees 
in january  we announced a restructuring plan in order to better align our costs with revenue levels 
in the first quarter of we expect to reduce our worldwide headcount by approximately employees and incur severance costs of approximately million 
amortization of identified intangibles amortization of acquisition related intangibles was million or of revenue in versus million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the slight decrease of million in versus is due to several intangible assets becoming fully amortized in  offset partially by the increased amortization of jetrion intangible assets starting in the fourth quarter of the increase of million in versus is primarily due to the inclusion of amortization of vutek intangible assets for a full year in versus seven months in we acquired vutek on june  and jetrion on october  acquired in process research and development at the time of acquisition of jetrion and vutek  we expensed acquired in process research and development of million for jetrion in and million for vutek in interest and other income  net interest and other income interest and other income was million in compared with million in  an increase of million 
interest and other income of million in represented a increase from million in both yearly increases were attributable to higher interest rates and higher average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
we had net realized losses on our marketable securities of million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents interest expense interest expense consists of interest and debt amortization costs related to our convertible senior debentures 
interest expense including debt amortization totaled million for each of the years ended december   and if we exercise our option to redeem the million in convertible senior debentures or if the holders require us to repurchase all or a significant portion of the convertible senior debentures  we believe we may need to seek alternative sources of liquidity 
this may include adding a line of credit and or converting all or portions of our investment portfolio into cash 
in either case  we would expect that our other income would decline due to the impact of higher interest costs on any new debt or lower expected interest income earned on our investment portfolio 
gain on sale of product line during the second quarter of  we sold our inventory and net assets related to our mwa line of products 
gross proceeds from the sale were million and we recognized a gain of million 
income taxes in  we recorded a tax benefit of million on a pre tax operating income of million  compared to a tax provision of million recorded in on pre tax operating income of million and a tax provision of million recorded in on pre tax operating loss of million 
in each of these years  we benefited from research and development credits  and in and  our taxes also decreased due to lower taxes on foreign income 
in addition  our taxes decreased in and due to the extra territorial income exclusion 
our taxes increased in each of these years due to non deductible stock compensation charges  and in due to in process research and development write offs related to the vutek acquisition 
as a result of discrete tax adjustments  our taxes in increased million due to interest accrued on prior year tax contingency reserves and million due to our reassessment of taxes resulting from our filing of our federal and state income tax returns

of this million tax charge  million related to earnings accumulated prior to and was recorded in the second quarter of the remaining tax charge of million related to foreign earnings and was reflected in the effective tax rate beginning in the second quarter 
in the fourth quarter  we repatriated million of earnings the million decided upon in the second quarter of plus an additional million to the us  which resulted in an additional tax charge of million in the fourth quarter 
effective january  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty 
table of contents in income taxes by requiring a tax position be recognized only when it is more likely than not that the tax position  based on its technical merits  will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable tax authority 
the tax benefit to be recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin has been recorded as an increase of million to retained earnings  and a decrease of million and million in goodwill and taxes payable respectively 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  purchase commitments  revenue recognition and contingencies 
the estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition  estimating allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and litigation accruals  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  valuation analyses for intangible assets and goodwill  business combinations  and the determination of functional currencies for the purposes of consolidating our international operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from product revenue  which includes hardware controllers  design licensed solutions  and inkjet printers and ink  software and royalties 
we also receive services and support revenue from software license maintenance agreements  customer support and training and consulting 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab and  when applicable  emerging issues task force  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  for the sale of controllers  printers  and ink 
as such  revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we use either a purchase order or signed contract as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through some of our oems are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
delivery for hardware generally is complete when title and risk of loss is transferred at point of shipment from manufacturing facilities 
in some instances  we also sell products and services in which the terms included in sales arrangements result in different timing for revenue recognition 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the contract or purchase order 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past 
table of contents transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we may not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we license our software primarily under perpetual licenses 
revenue from software consists of software licensing  post contract customer support and professional consulting 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and if applicable  sab and eitf to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
when several elements  including software licenses  post contract customer support and professional services  are sold to a customer through a single contract  the revenue from such multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element using the residual method in accordance with sop revenue is allocated to the support elements and professional service elements of an agreement using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe and to the software license portion of the agreements using the residual method 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of our professional services based on the rates charged to our customers in stand alone orders 
we have also established vsoe of fair value for post contract customer support based on substantive renewal rates 
accordingly  software license fees are recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software is licensed with maintenance and or professional services  and where the maintenance and professional services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software 
revenue allocated to software licenses is recognized when the following four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
revenue allocated to post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract assuming the four basic criteria are met 
we also have subscription arrangements where the customer pays a fixed fee and receives services over a period of time 
we recognize revenue from the subscriptions ratably over the service period 
any upfront setup fees associated with our subscription arrangements are recognized ratably  generally over one year 
allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and litigation accruals 
to determine the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts  management must make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivables 
to do so  management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million as of december  similarly  management must make estimates of potential future inventory obsolescence and purchase commitments to measure the need for inventory reserves 
management analyzes current economic trends  changes in customer demand and the acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of such allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowances and reserves in any accounting period 
material differences may result in changes in the amount and timing of our income for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our inventory balance was million  net of inventory reserves of million  as of december  we accrue for estimated legal expenses  including potential regulatory fines when the likelihood of the incurrence of the related costs is probable and management has the ability to estimate such costs 
until both of these conditions are met  the related legal expenses are recorded as incurred 
the material assumptions we use to estimate the amount of legal expenses include communication between our external attorneys and us on the expected duration of the lawsuit and the estimated expenses during that time  
table of contents our strategy regarding the lawsuit  the deductible amounts under the insurance policies  and past experiences with similar lawsuits 
the outcome of any particular lawsuit cannot be predicted  and if the outcome is different than expected  our income could be materially impacted  either positively or negatively 
we have from time to time set up allowances or accruals for uncertainties related to revenues and for potential unfavorable outcomes from disputes with customers or vendors 
management bases its estimates for the allowances or accruals on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r  share based payment 
we must use our judgment in determining and applying the assumptions needed for the valuation of stock options  issuances under our employee stock purchase plan  and stock awards 
we also are required to apply a forfeiture rate to reflect what we believe will be our final expense related to stock based compensation 
the amounts to be recorded as stock based compensation expense expected in the future are subject to change if our assumptions for the variables used in determining the fair value of the instruments and the forfeiture rates are revised 
accounting for income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate our actual current tax expense and the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery of these deferred assets is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we either establish or increase a valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have maintained a valuation allowance of million as of december  for foreign tax credits resulting from the acquisition of best and compensation deductions potentially limited by us internal revenue code section m 
if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
net deferred tax assets as of december  were million 
valuation analyses of intangible assets and goodwill 
we review goodwill annually in the third quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the provisions of sfas goodwill and other intangible assets sfas require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with our product categories identified in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of market and income approaches 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenues or earnings of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds 
table of contents the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment testing order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets and goodwill totaled million as of december  our annual review of goodwill performed in the third quarter of indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill 
in january  the company s market capitalization declined significantly as a result of not achieving the planned revenue and profit targets for the quarter ended december  consequently  we updated our goodwill impairment analysis as of december  there was no impairment of goodwill resulting from this updated analysis 
in addition  the identifiable intangible and other long lived assets were not considered to be subject to an impairment analysis triggering event since the cash flows related to such assets were not impacted by the market capitalization decline 
there have been no impairments of goodwill or intangible assets in  and business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or other actual results 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions include severance costs and the costs of vacating duplicate facilities 
these costs are based upon estimates made by management and are subject to refinement 
we estimate the future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities 
estimated costs may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and as management continues its assessment of the pre merger operations 

table of contents our financial projections may ultimately prove to be inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
therefore  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast revenues and costs to develop such projects will transpire as projected 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidating our international operations 
we have a number of foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our net revenues  approximately of our total assets and approximately of our total liabilities as of december  we typically quote and bill our international customers in united states dollars 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed below  we consider the united states dollar to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries except for our japanese subsidiaries  efi kk  and electronics for imaging japan yk  for which we consider the japanese yen to be the subsidiary s functional currency and our german subsidiary  electronics for imaging gmbh  for which we consider the euro to be the subsidiary s functional currency 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  when the transactions are not denominated in the functional currency  are included within the statement of operations or  if the transactions are denominated in the functional currency  are included as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income

liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for provided by financing activities overview cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the decrease is primarily due to million in net purchases of property and equipment and purchases of treasury stock and net settlement of restricted stock of million offset by cash generated by operations of million and cash received from the issuance of common stock of million 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in  and of million  million  and million  respectively  was primarily the result of net income loss adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  acquired in process research and development  deferred income taxes  stock based compensation and changes in various assets and liabilities such as accounts payable  accounts receivable and other current assets 

table of contents our historical and primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers 
one measure of the effectiveness of our collection efforts is average days sales outstanding dso for accounts receivable 
dsos were days  days  and days at december   and respectively 
we calculate accounts receivable dso by dividing the net accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter by the amount of revenue recognized for the quarter multiplied by the total days in the quarter 
the increase in dsos is due to the increased percentage of revenues from direct sales of our inkjet products 
our dsos related to direct sales are traditionally higher than those related to oem customers 
we expect dsos to vary from period to period because of changes in quarterly mix of business between our direct and oem customers  and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
as the percentage of our apps and inkjet related revenue increases  we expect dsos may trend higher 
our operating cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and by our accrual of liabilities 
in  the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased our cash flows by approximately million compared to an increase in cash flows in of million 
in  the change in income taxes payable increased our cash flows by million compared to an increase in cash flows in of million 
our working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash and internally generated funds 
we expect to generate positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict whether current trends and conditions will continue  or the effect on our business from the competitive environment in which we operate 
we believe the working capital available to us will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months

our property and equipment additions have been funded by cash from operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including our hiring of employees  the rate of change in computer hardware software used in our business  our business outlook  and decisions to invest or expand business sites 
investments during  we received net proceeds from our marketable securities of million 
we made net purchases of marketable securities in of million 
in  we received net proceeds from our marketable securities of million  reflecting the liquidation of marketable securities for the purchase of vutek 
we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as the primary objectives 
we generally hold investments in corporate bonds and u 
s 
government agency securities to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
restricted investments we have restricted investments classified as non current assets in connection with the synthetic leases for our foster city offices 
we are required to maintain cash in libor based interest bearing accounts which fully collateralize our synthetic leases 
we had million in collateral accounted for as restricted investments at december  and for further information on these transactions  see the discussion at off balance sheet financing 
financing activities historically  our recurring cash flows provided by financing activities have been from the receipt of cash from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we received cash proceeds from these plans in the amount of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
while we may continue to receive proceeds from these plans in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the plans and general market conditions 
we anticipate that cash provided from exercise of stock options may decline over time as we shift to issuance of restricted stock awards and units rather than stock option awards 
the primary use of funds for financing activities in and was the use of million and million  respectively  of cash to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock 
no shares were repurchased during see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for further discussion of our programs to repurchase our common stock 

table of contents the synthetic lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees 
under fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after december   must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
we have determined that the guarantees have no material value as of december  and therefore have not recorded any liability 
on or after june   we have an option to redeem the million in convertible senior debentures  for cash at any time as a whole  or from time to time in part  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debenture to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any 
in addition  on june  a holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of that holder s debentures at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of those debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any  to  but not including  the date of repurchase in cash 
finally  a holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of that holder s debentures if a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  occurs prior to june  at of their principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any to  but not including  the repurchase date 
we may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash 
if we exercise our option to redeem the million in convertible senior debentures or if the holders require us to repurchase all or a significant portion of the convertible senior debentures  we believe we may need to seek alternative sources of liquidity 
this may include adding a line of credit and or converting all or portions of our investment portfolio into cash 
in either case  we would expect that our other income would decline due to the impact of higher interest costs on any new debt or lower expected interest income earned on our investment portfolio 
we believe we have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet our obligations other commitments our inventory for our controller line of products consists primarily of raw and finished goods  memory subsystems  processors and asics which are sold to third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing our products 
our inventory for our inkjet line of products consists of raw and finished goods  printheads  frames and other components 
should we decide to purchase components and do our own manufacturing of controllers  or should it become necessary for us to purchase and sell components other than the processors  asics or memory subsystems for our contract manufacturers  inventory balances and potentially property and equipment would increase significantly  thereby reducing our available cash resources 
further  the inventory we carry could become obsolete  thereby negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations 
we are also reliant on several sole source suppliers for certain key components and could experience a further significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations if such supply were reduced or not available 
we may be required to compensate our sub contract manufacturers for components purchased for orders subsequently cancelled by us 
we periodically review the potential liability and the adequacy of the related allowance 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we were required to compensate the sub contract manufacturers in amounts in excess of the related allowance 
legal proceedings in addition to the matters discussed under item  legal proceedings  we are involved from time to time in litigation relating to claims arising in the normal course of our business 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  except for million in convertible senior debentures which is reported as current 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations interest payments on senior convertible debentures convertible senior debentures purchase obligations total lease obligations related to the principal corporate facilities are estimated and are based on current market interest rates libor 
see off balance sheet financing 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our convertible senior debentures 
total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  or certain purchase orders as discussed below 
purchase obligations in the table above include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services that are cancelable without penalty 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are generally fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which is uncertain 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet financing synthetic lease arrangements we are a party to two synthetic leases the lease and the lease  together leases covering our foster city facilities located at and velocity way  foster city  california 
these leases provide a cost effective means of providing adequate office space for our corporate offices 
both leases expire in july we may  at our option  purchase the facilities during or at the end of the term of the leases for the amount expended by the lessor to purchase the facilities million for the lease and million for the lease 
we have guaranteed to the lessor a residual value associated with the buildings equal to of their funding of the respective leases 
under the financial covenants  we must maintain a minimum net worth and a minimum tangible net worth as of the end of each quarter 
there is an additional covenant regarding mergers 
we were in compliance with all such financial and merger related covenants as of december  we are liable to the lessor for the financed amount of the buildings if we default on our covenants 

table of contents we have assessed our exposure in relation to the first loss guarantees under the leases and believe that there is no deficiency to the guaranteed value at december  if there is a decline in value  we will record a loss associated with the residual value guarantee 
the funds pledged under the leases million for the lease and million for the lease at december  for a total of million are in libor based interest bearing accounts and are restricted as to withdrawal at all times 
in conjunction with the leases  we leased the land on which the buildings are located to the lessor of the buildings 
these separate ground leases are for approximately years 
we are treated as the owner of these buildings for federal income tax purposes 
effective july   we applied the accounting and disclosure rules set forth in interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised fin r for variable interest entities vies 
we have evaluated our synthetic lease agreements to determine if the arrangements qualify as variable interest entities under fin r 
we have determined that the synthetic lease agreements do qualify as vies  however  because we are not the primary beneficiary under fin r we are not required to consolidate the vies in our financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  general credit  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation  liquidity  and interest rate risks  which may be exacerbated by the us sub prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we may enter into financial instrument contracts to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the counterparties to such contracts are major financial institutions 
interest rate risk marketable securities we maintain an investment portfolio of short term investments of various holdings  types and maturities 
these short term investments are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents the hypothetical change in fair values in the financial instruments held by us at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps over a twelve month time horizon 
this table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a twelve month time horizon in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of basis points no change in interest rates valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of basis points 
table of contents convertible senior debentures the fair value of our convertible senior debentures was estimated to be million as of december  and the carrying value was million 
the fair market value of our convertible senior debentures was estimated based upon quoted market prices 
derivatives we do not use any derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales in japan and europe and operating expenses in germany  india  japan and the netherlands 
at the present time  we do not hedge against these currency exposures  but as these exposures grow we may consider hedging against currency movements 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities  typically us treasury and agencies securities  corporate debt instruments  and asset backed instruments 
these short term investments are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading
