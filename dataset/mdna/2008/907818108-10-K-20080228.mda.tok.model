item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the financial statements and supplementary data  item  and other information in this report  including risk factors set forth in item a and critical accounting policies and cautionary information at the end of this item the railroad  along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates  is our one reportable operating segment 
although we analyze revenue by commodity group  we analyze the net financial results of the railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network 
executive summary results safety we operated a safer railroad in  improving safety for our employees  customers  and the public 
the employee injury incident rate per  man hours declined to its lowest level 
a continued focus on derailment prevention in resulted in a reduction in incidents  with associated costs declining 
in the area of public safety  we closed grade crossings to reduce our exposure incidents  and we installed additional video cameras in our road locomotives 
as a result of this installation work  we now have camera equipped locomotives in the lead position of over of our road trains 
these video cameras allow us to better analyze grade crossing incidents  thereby increasing safety for our employees and the public 
the number of grade crossing incidents decreased during the year  despite the combination of increasing highway traffic and urban expansion 
also  through extensive trespass reduction programs  we were able to reduce trespasser incidents by 
all of these improvements are the result of comprehensive efforts to enhance employee training  increase public education  make capital investments  and take proactive steps to reduce safety risks 
financial performance in  we generated record operating income of billion despite lower volume 
yield increases  network management initiatives  and improved productivity drove the increase in operating income 
our operating ratio was for the year  a point improvement compared to net income of billion also exceeded our previous milestone  translating into earnings of per diluted share 
commodity revenue our commodity revenue grew year over year to billion  the highest level in our history 
we achieved record revenue levels in five of our six commodity groups  driven primarily by better pricing and fuel surcharges 
since  we have repriced approximately of our business 
volume decreased in due to softening markets for some of our commodities and adverse weather conditions 
network operations in  we significantly improved the fluidity and efficiency of our transportation network 
continued focus on increasing velocity  eliminating work events  improving asset utilization  and expanding capacity were key drivers of our operational improvement 
we reduced average terminal dwell time by  improved car utilization by  and increased average train speed by with ongoing enhancements to our unified plan an ongoing program that streamlines segments of our transportation plan and implementation of initiatives to make train processing at our terminals more efficient 
we completed implementation of customer inventory management system  an operational productivity initiative that complements the unified plan by reducing the number of rail cars in our terminals without adding capacity 
we also expanded capacity and continued to use industrial engineering techniques to further improve network fluidity  ease capacity constraints  and improve asset utilization 
our customer satisfaction improved during  an indication that efforts to improve network operations translated into better customer service 

table of contents fuel prices crude oil prices increased at a steady rate in  rising from a low of per barrel in january to close at nearly per barrel at the end of december 
our average fuel price increased by and added million of operating expenses compared to our fuel surcharge programs are designed to help offset the impact of higher fuel prices 
in addition  our fuel conservation efforts allowed us to improve our consumption rate by 
locomotive simulator training  operating practices  and technology all contributed to this improvement  saving approximately million gallons of fuel in free cash flow cash generated by operating activities totaled a record billion  yielding free cash flow of million in free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities  less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid 
free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap by sec regulation g and item of sec regulation s k 
we believe free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  cash provided by operating activities 
the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow non gaap measure millions of dollars cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities dividends paid free cash flow outlook safety operating a safe railroad benefits our employees  our customers  our shareholders  and the public 
we will continue using a multi faceted approach to safety  utilizing technology  risk assessment  quality control  and training for  and engaging with our employees 
we plan to implement total safety culture tsc throughout our operations 
tsc  an employee focused initiative that has helped improve safety  is a process designed to establish  maintain  and promote safety among co workers 
with respect to public safety  we will continue our efforts to maintain  upgrade  and close crossings  install video cameras on locomotives  and educate the public about crossing safety through various internal and industry programs  along with other activities 
commodity revenue despite uncertainty regarding the us economy  we expect record revenue in based on current economic indicators  forecasted demand  improved customer service  and additional opportunities to reprice certain of our business 
yield increases and fuel surcharges will be the primary drivers of commodity revenue growth in we expect that overall volume will fall within a range of higher to lower than  with continued softness in some market sectors 
transportation plan in  we will continue to evaluate traffic flows and network logistic patterns to identify additional opportunities to simplify operations and improve network efficiency and asset utilization 
we plan to maintain adequate manpower and locomotives  improve productivity using industrial engineering techniques  and improve our operating margins 
fuel prices fuel prices should remain volatile  with crude oil prices and conversion and regional spreads fluctuating throughout the year 
on average  we expect fuel prices to increase to above the average price in to reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings  we will continue to seek recovery from our customers through our fuel surcharge programs and expand our fuel conservation efforts 

table of contents capital plan in  we expect to make capital investments of approximately billion which may be revised if revenue  tax  or business conditions require changing  or new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on  these investments 
major investment categories include billion to maintain and improve track infrastructure  million to increase network and terminal capacity  million to upgrade our locomotive and freight car fleet  including the acquisition of high horsepower locomotives and new covered hoppers  and million primarily to upgrade information technology systems  including the testing of positive train control  and other capital projects 
we expect to fund our cash capital investments through cash generated from operations  the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  debt issuances  and cash on hand at december  our annual capital plan is a critical component of our long term strategic plan  which we designed to enhance the long term value of the corporation for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i maintain and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations  ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track  and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for long term growth 
financial expectations we are cautious about the economic environment  however  we anticipate revenue growth and continued network improvement in  which should produce financial results that exceed we expect to generate earnings of to per diluted share and improve our operating ratio and return on invested capital 
results of operations operating revenue millions of dollars change v change v commodity revenue other revenue total operating revenue includes commodity revenue and other revenue 
the primary drivers of commodity revenue are volume carloads and average revenue per car arc 
arc varies with changes in price  commodity mix  and fuel surcharges 
other revenue consists primarily of revenue earned by our subsidiaries  revenue from our commuter rail operations  and accessorial revenue  which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage 
we recognize commodity revenue on a percentage of completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination 
we allocate revenue between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 
we recognize other revenue as service is performed or contractual obligations are met 
we provide incentives to our customers for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations  which we record as a reduction to revenue based on the actual or projected future shipments 
revenue from five of our six commodity groups increased during  while revenue generated from industrial products shipments declined 
arc increased during driven by core price improvement 
lower shipments of industrial and agricultural products drove volume down in  more than offsetting an increase in chemical shipments 
our fuel surcharge programs excluding index based contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated billion in commodity revenue in fuel surcharge revenue is not comparable to prior periods due to implementation of new mileage based fuel surcharge programs for certain traffic 
as previously disclosed in our annual report on form k  the stb issued a decision limiting the manner in which us railroads can calculate fuel surcharges on traffic regulated by the 
table of contents stb 
effective april   we implemented new fuel surcharge programs covering this regulated traffic  which represents approximately of our current revenue base 
these new programs use mileage as opposed to percent of revenue as the basis for calculating fuel surcharges  and they use the on highway diesel price index published by the energy information administration for purposes of determining fuel costs 
the new programs affect fuel surcharges assessed for certain shipments of agricultural  chemical  and industrial products  and  to a lesser extent  coal 
in addition  we reset the effective base fuel price at which our new mileage based fuel surcharge programs take effect  resulting in a higher starting point of per gallon versus per gallon 
all six commodity groups produced double digit revenue growth in  including over growth of revenue from agricultural commodities 
price increases  fuel surcharges  and index based contract escalators  which are formulas in our shipping contracts that correlate price adjustments to certain economic indices  all contributed to higher arc 
our fuel surcharge programs excluding index based contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated an additional million in commodity revenue compared to  contributing to commodity revenue growth 
volume increased during the year  led by solid growth of intermodal and energy shipments  which were partially offset by lower shipments of industrial products and chemicals 
lower volume in due to the january west coast storm  sprb joint line disruptions  hurricane rita and the kansas washouts also contributed to this year over year growth

table of contents agricultural price increases were the primary drivers of agricultural commodity revenue in  partially offset by a decline in volume levels 
shipments of whole grains used in feed declined as barge operators captured more shipments destined for export from the gulf coast due to both favorable barge rates and improved navigation conditions on the mississippi river 
conversely  wheat and food grain shipments improved as a strong wheat crop generated record shipments to the gulf coast for export 
shipments of ethanol  a grain product used as an alternative fuel and fuel additive  and its co products primarily livestock feed also increased substantially 
price increases  volume growth  and fuel surcharges increased agricultural commodity revenue in versus whole grains increased as strong gulf exports and higher freight charges for barge traffic shifted feed grain shipments to rails 
shipments of ethanol logo and its co products primarily livestock feed also experienced strong growth  reflecting continued demand in this growing industry 
conversely  wheat shipments declined due to extremely low crop production levels in primarily due to drought conditions in wheat producing states 
price and fuel surcharge increases improved arc in automotive price increases drove the growth in automotive revenue  partially offset by lower finished vehicle shipments 
a decline in vehicle production levels primarily drove the volume decline 
conversely  automotive parts shipments grew due to increased volumes from domestic manufacturers  new business acquired in the middle of  and our new intermodal train service between mexico and michigan 
price increases  volume growth  and fuel surcharges increased automotive commodity revenue in over shipments of finished vehicles grew as higher manufacturer inventories at the end of translated into record volume growth in shipments remained relatively strong through the second quarter due to the production ramp up of new models at plants served by us 
automotive parts shipments also grew due to conversion of traffic from trucks  new business growth  and production increases at several assembly plants served by us 
fuel surcharges and price increases drove the arc improvement

table of contents chemicals price increases and volume growth drove the increase in revenue in versus strong demand for potash exports through pacific northwest ports and a robust planting season for corn to supply ethanol producers increased demand for fertilizer shipments in new business acquired in june contributed to more shipments of plastics 
soda ash volume increased as export demand grew in the gulf area and mexico 
lower production at canadian locations during the year boosted shipments of liquid and dry chemicals from us sources 
price increases  fuel surcharges  and index based contract escalators drove the increase in revenue and arc in versus fewer fertilizer shipments largely drove the volume decrease 
wet weather conditions in the midwest led to weak demand during the fall planting season 
in addition  softer export markets for potash  a fertilizer product  also led to reduced volumes 
business interruptions logo in the third quarter of  primarily attributable to hurricane rita  reduced chemicals shipments leading to favorable volume comparisons in energy price increases during improved both revenue and arc over levels 
volume was flat  however  as severe storms in the first quarter and heavy rains in may flooded coal pits in the sprb  which closed several rail lines and reduced volume levels 
shipments from the colorado and utah mines were down due to lower mine production  predominately in the fourth quarter of price increases  fuel surcharges  and index based contract escalators primarily drove the increases in revenue and arc in over volume increases also contributed to revenue growth as coal shipments from the sprb mines improved during the year 
these increases in partially reflect lower volume levels in  as sprb joint line disruptions  network disruptions resulting from hurricane rita  and the october kansas washouts hampered coal shipments in conversely  shipments from the colorado and utah mines declined in due to mine shutdowns during logo the first quarter of  along with the impact of mining production problems and network maintenance throughout the third quarter of 
table of contents industrial products volume declines more than offset price increases  driving industrial products revenue lower in compared to continued softening of the housing construction market  surplus inventories  and general market uncertainty resulted in lower lumber shipments 
delays of rail expansion projects  customer production problems  unfavorable weather  and the ongoing impact of a weak residential construction market reduced stone shipments during the year 
price increases and fuel surcharges improved revenue and arc in over volume levels declined due to lower lumber  paper  and newsprint shipments  which were partially offset by higher steel shipments 
the softening of the housing construction market  lower production levels  and general market uncertainty drove the reduction in lumber shipments 
conversely  strong domestic markets throughout most of the year drove the increase in logo construction related steel material and pipe  particularly those materials used in oil and gas drilling 
hurricane rita reduced shipment volumes of industrial products in  which favorably affected volume comparisons with intermodal price increases improved intermodal revenue in compared to volume was flat versus as increased domestic traffic due to new service offerings and increased business under some of our older  long term contracts were offset by a decrease of premium shipments 
international traffic was flat in compared to due to general softening of imports from asia 
record volume growth  fuel surcharges  price increases  and index based contract escalators combined to improve revenue in over  in addition to the favorable impact from weaker intermodal revenue during due to the january west coast storm 
carloadings grew due to strong imports  primarily from asia  partially offset by decreased domestic traffic 
arc improved due to price increases  fuel surcharges  and contract escalators

wage  benefit and materials inflation and higher depreciation expense also increased expenses during the year 
productivity improvements  better resource utilization  and a lower fuel consumption rate helped offset these increases 
operating expenses increased million in higher fuel prices  which rose during the period  accounted for million of the increase 
our fuel surcharge programs helped offset these expenses in the form of higher revenue 
wages  benefits  and materials and supplies inflation  a larger workforce  volume related expenses  and higher locomotive and freight car maintenance and lease expenses accounted for most of the additional increase in settlement of all remaining insurance claims related to the january west coast storm  an improved fuel consumption rate  and improved car cycle times which reduced freight car rental logo expense partially offset the cost increases 
additional clean up and restoration costs for the january west coast storm favorably affects comparison of operating expenses with those in salaries  wages  and employee benefits operational improvements and lower volume levels led to a decline in our workforce  saving million in a smaller workforce and less need for new train personnel reduced training costs during the year  which contributed to the improvement 
general wage and benefit inflation mostly offset the reductions  reflecting higher salaries and wages and the impact of higher healthcare and other benefit costs 
general wage and benefit inflation increased expenses in  reflecting higher salaries and wages and the impact of higher healthcare and other benefit costs 
a larger workforce  driven by higher volume levels  and stock option expense required by new accounting rules also contributed to higher expenses 
conversely  reduced protection costs and operational improvements  boosted by network management initiatives and investment in capacity  partially offset these increases 
protection costs represent the differential payment when the wage earned for active employment is lower than an employee s protected rate of pay 
an individual s protected rate is imposed by the stb for employees adversely affected by a merger or is established by collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions in certain cases 
additionally  we incurred higher labor expenses in for clean up and restoration of property damaged by the january west coast storm 
fuel and utilities fuel and utilities include locomotive fuel  utilities other than telephone  and gasoline and other fuels 
higher diesel fuel prices  which averaged per gallon including taxes and transportation 
table of contents costs in compared to per gallon in  increased expenses by million 
a improvement of our fuel consumption rate resulting from the use of newer  more fuel efficient locomotives and our fuel conservation programs reduced fuel expense by million  and a decrease of gross ton miles reduced fuel expense by an additional million 
higher diesel fuel prices  which averaged per gallon including taxes and transportation costs in compared to per gallon in  increased expenses by million during a increase in gross ton miles resulted in million of additional expenses  which was partially offset by a improvement in our fuel consumption rate due to the use of newer  more fuel efficient locomotives and our fuel conservation programs 
as noted above and described in this item  we offset a significant portion of increased locomotive fuel expenses through revenue from fuel surcharges 
gasoline  utilities  and propane and other fuel expenses increased million in due to higher prices and increased usage 
equipment and other rents equipment and other rents includes primarily rental expense we pay for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies  freight car  intermodal  and locomotive leases  other specialty equipment leases  and office and other rentals 
fewer shipments of industrial products  combined with improved car cycle times  which reflect operational improvement and better asset utilization  reduced our short term freight car rental expense by million in compared to lower lease expenses for freight cars  intermodal containers  and fleet vehicles and equipment decreased costs by million in conversely  higher locomotive lease expense resulted in a million increase in costs during the year 
lease expense increased in compared to as we leased more locomotives and freight cars 
growth in automotive and intermodal shipments also increased our short term freight car rental expense 
improved car cycle times driven by network management initiatives partially offset this increase 
depreciation the majority of depreciation relates to track structure  including rail  ties  and other track material 
a higher depreciable asset base  reflecting higher capital spending in recent years  increased depreciation expense in and materials and supplies materials used to maintain our lines  structures  and equipment are the principal components of materials and supplies expense 
this expense item also includes small tools  office supplies  other materials  and the costs of freight services to ship supplies and materials 
increased use of higher cost components to repair and maintain our fleet of locomotives including a growing number of units not covered by warranties added million to materials and supplies expense during conversely  we used fewer parts for freight car repairs due to program maintenance scheduling  which lowered costs by million and partially offset the increase for we used more repair materials at higher component costs to repair and maintain freight cars and locomotives in  including a growing number of units not covered by warranties 
in addition  we performed more maintenance on locomotives that were maintained internally and not subject to maintenance contracts with third party contractors compared to casualty costs personal injury costs  freight and property damage  insurance  and environmental expense are the primary components of casualty costs 
casualty costs were lower in compared to driven primarily by a reduction in personal injury expense 
actuarial studies completed during resulted in a reduction in personal injury expense of approximately million  which was partially offset by an adverse development with respect to one claim 
costs were flat in compared to as lower bad debt expenses  lower freight damage expenses  and lower expenses for destruction of foreign or leased equipment all offset increased personal injury costs and higher settlement expenses

operating lease activities during  the railroad  as lessee  entered into long term operating lease arrangements covering locomotives and rail cars  with a total equipment cost of approximately million 
in total  these new lease arrangements will provide for minimum rental payments of approximately million  with a present value of approximately million 
the lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives and freight cars  in part  by issuing equipment notes that are non recourse to the railroad and are secured by assignments of the underlying leases and security interests in the equipment 
the corporation and the railroad do not guaranty payment of the equipment notes 
the railroad s obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the railroad has certain renewal and purchase options with respect to the locomotives and freight cars 
if the railroad does not exercise these options  the equipment will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below  we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition 
however  based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event  or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity 
in addition  our commercial obligations  financings  and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations  particularly within the transportation industry

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements sale of receivables the railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables  inc upri  a bankruptcy remote subsidiary  as part of a sale of receivables facility 
upri sells  without recourse on a day revolving basis  an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors 
the total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was million at both december  and the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was million at both december  and  respectively 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our consolidated financial statements 
the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by  million and  million of accounts receivable held by upri at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  the value of the interest retained by upri was million and million  respectively 
this retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements 
the interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value  which approximates fair value  and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks  including default and dilution 
if default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point  the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by million 
should our credit rating fall below investment grade  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced  and  in certain cases  the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 
the railroad services the sold receivables  however  the railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or liability as the servicing fees adequately compensate us for these responsibilities 
the railroad collected approximately billion and billion during the years ended december  and  respectively 
upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 
the costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the costs include interest  program fees paid to banks  commercial paper issuing costs  and fees for unused commitment availability 
the investors have no recourse to the railroad s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims 
creditors of the railroad do not have recourse to the assets of upri 
in august  the sale of receivables program was renewed for an additional day period without any significant changes in terms 
guarantees at december   we were contingently liable for million in guarantees 
we have recorded a liability of million and million for the fair value of these obligations as of december  and  respectively 
we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business  and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building  equipment financings  and affiliated operations 
the final guarantee expires in we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees 
we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
other matters inflation the cumulative effect of long periods of inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies 
as a result  assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels  depreciation charges on an inflation adjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 
derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and  by policy  do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a 
table of contents specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged  both at inception and throughout the hedged period 
we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions  and method of assessing hedge effectiveness 
changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings 
we may use swaps  collars  futures  and or forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices  however  the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 
market and credit risk we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item 
we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments  which is minimal  by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements 
at december  and  we were not required to provide collateral  nor had we received collateral  relating to our hedging activities 
determination of fair value we determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows 
sensitivity analyses the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition 
these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 
at december   we had variable rate debt representing approximately of our total debt 
if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in than our december  variable rate  which was approximately  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variable rate debt at december  market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december   and amounts to an increase of approximately million to the fair value of our debt at december  we estimated the fair values of our fixed rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 
interest rate fair value hedges we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period 
we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings 
we employ derivatives  primarily swaps  as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix 
in addition  we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt securities 
swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates 
we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the short cut method pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  therefore  we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate cash flow hedges we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings 
at december  and  we had reductions of million and million  respectively  recorded as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straight line basis through september  as of december  and  we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 

table of contents fuel swaps two fuel basis swaps cover a total of million gallons of diesel fuel for the period august through july these commodity basis swaps require us to make payments to  or receive payments from  the counterparty based on the difference between certain price indices 
changes in the fair value of these swaps are reflected in fuel expense 
we reported a derivative asset of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which represents the fair value of the swaps 
the swaps increased fuel expense for by million and reduced fuel expense for by million 
the recognition of the swaps in fuel expense included monthly net settlements with the counterparty and the change in fair value 
accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of fas are effective for us beginning in we expect this new standard will result in increased disclosures but will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas 
the fair value option established by fas permits  but does not require  all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
an entity would report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
fas is effective for us beginning in we do not currently intend to elect the fair value option for any eligible items and do not expect this standard to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  business combinations fas r 
fas r will change the accounting for business combinations 
under fas r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
fas r will also change the accounting treatment and disclosures with respect to certain specific items in a business combination 
fas r applies to us prospectively for business combinations occurring on or after january  accordingly  any business combinations we engage in will be recorded and disclosed following existing gaap until january  we expect fas r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations  but the effect will be dependent upon any potential future acquisitions 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
fas 
fas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
fas is effective for us beginning in we are still assessing the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of fas on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  the fasb ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 collaborative arrangements eitf  which defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting and disclosure requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement 
the requirements of this eitf will be applied to collaborative arrangements in existence on or after january  we are still assessing the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of eitf on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
asserted and unasserted claims various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity  however  to the extent possible  where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated  we have recorded a liability 
we do not expect that any known lawsuits  claims  environmental costs  commitments  contingent liabilities  or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of 
table of contents operations  financial condition  or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these matters 
indemnities our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements  including certain tax indemnifications  can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount  depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements 
due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved  we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements 
we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 
climate change although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item a  we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact 
however  we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment  including investments in new technologies  using training programs to reduce fuel consumption  and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenue  expenses  assets  and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note to the financial statements and supplementary data  item these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 
asbestos we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos 
during  we engaged a third party with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos related claims to assist us in assessing our potential liability 
during  we updated our potential liability to include actual claim experience since as a result of this reassessment  we decreased our liability by million in for both asserted and unasserted asbestos related claims through this liability excludes future defense and processing costs 
the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions the number of future claims received would be consistent with historical averages 
the number of claims filed against us will decline each year 
the average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages 
the percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages 

table of contents our asbestos related liability activity was as follows millions of dollars beginning balance accruals credits payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately related to unasserted claims 
these claims are expected to be paid out over the next years 
in conjunction with the liability update performed in  we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries 
we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december  and we will continue to review actual experience and adjust our estimate as warranted 
our asbestos related claims activity was as follows open claims  beginning balance new claims settled or dismissed claims open claims  ending balance at december we believe that our estimates of liability for asbestos related claims and insurance recoveries are reasonable and probable 
the amounts recorded for asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  average settlement costs  and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts 
estimates also may vary in the future if strategies  activities  and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change  federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants  and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 
environmental we are subject to federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations 
we identified sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements 
this includes sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government  of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list 
certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites  consequently  our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties  in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 
our environmental liability activity was as follows millions of dollars beginning balance accruals payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december 
table of contents our environmental site activity was as follows open sites  beginning balance new sites closed sites open sites  ending balance at december when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned  leased  or otherwise used in our business  we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property 
we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred 
we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs 
we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable 
the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites  as well as ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties 
cost estimates are based on information available for each site  financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and existing technology  laws  and regulations 
the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties  site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties  the degree of contamination by various wastes  the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites  and the speculative nature of remediation costs 
estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal  state  and local laws governing environmental remediation 
current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity 
personal injury the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year 
we use third party actuaries to assist us in measuring the expense and liability  including unasserted claims 
the federal employers liability act fela governs compensation for work related accidents 
under fela  damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements 
we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 
our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable us treasury rates 
approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claims  and approximately related to unasserted claims 
estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation 
our personal injury liability activity was as follows millions of dollars beginning balance accruals payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december 
table of contents our personal injury claims activity was as follows open claims  beginning balance new claims settled or dismissed claims open claims  ending balance at december depreciation the railroad industry is capital intensive 
properties are carried at cost 
provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property 
the lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group  based on the results of internal depreciation studies 
we are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates to the stb for review and approval every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property 
the cost net of salvage of depreciable railroad property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation  and no gain or loss is recognized 
a gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition because the gain or loss is not part of rail operations 
the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized based on estimated service lives of the software 
significant capital spending in recent years increased the total value of our depreciable assets 
cash capital spending totaled billion for the year ended december  for the year ended december   depreciation expense was billion 
we use various methods to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property 
due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets  variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year  annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately million 
if the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year  annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million 
income taxes as required under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
these expected future consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax law are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
for example  a increase in the federal income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately million 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based on management s judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events 
based on that analysis  there was no valuation allowance at december  or when we have claimed tax benefits that may be challenged by a tax authority  these uncertain tax benefits are accounted for under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
we adopted fin beginning january  prior to  income tax contingencies were accounted for under fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
under fin  we recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
a liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement

for additional information on the adoption of fin  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits we use third party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees 
in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several assumptions 
the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets 
for opeb  the critical assumptions are the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate 
we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually  and selected assumptions are based on the following factors discount rate is based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds rated aa by a recognized rating agency for which the timing and amount of cash flows matches our plan s expected benefit payments 
expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return  taking into consideration current and expected market conditions 
healthcare cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions 
the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension and opeb expense for and the estimated impact on pension and opeb expense relative to a change in those assumptions assumptions pension opeb discount rate salary increase n a expected return on plan assets n a healthcare cost trend rate pre current n a pre level in n a post current n a post level in n a sensitivities increase in expense millions of dollars pension opeb decrease in discount rate increase in salary scale n a decrease in expected return on plan assets n a increase in healthcare cost trend rate n a cautionary information certain statements in this report  and statements in other reports or information filed or to be filed with the sec as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us  are  or will be  forward looking statements as defined by the securities act of and the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements include  without limitation  statements regarding dividends in item and statements and information set forth under the caption outlook in this item  and any other statements or information in this report including information incorporated herein by reference regarding expectations as to operational or service improvements  expectations regarding the effectiveness of steps taken or to be taken to improve operations  service  infrastructure improvements
