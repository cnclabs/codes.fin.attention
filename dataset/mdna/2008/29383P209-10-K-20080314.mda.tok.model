overview we are a provider of advanced electronic systems and sub systems for enterprise  consumer and other high growth markets 
as of december   our patent portfolio consisted of more than patents and patent applications pending 
we believe that our strong patent portfolio and intellectual property position will allow us to continue to expand our business as demand for high density memory increases and to capitalize on emerging market opportunities 
we intend to exploit our intellectual property and capabilities to establish market leadership in new technologies 
on august   we acquired southland  a provider of memory products and services to oems since southland s headquarters and manufacturing facility is located in irvine  california  with sales offices in san jose  california and boise  idaho 
through this acquisition  we expect to increase the opportunity to deploy ip to top tier server oems and data center end customers

product revenue in was million  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
license revenue in was million  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
our decrease in product revenue during  compared to  was primarily due to a decrease in both leaded package and bga stacks 
this decline was driven by the continuing shift from ddr to ddr technologies 
ddr devices are enclosed in bga packages and the demand for stacks of this technology has not grown to offset the decline in leaded packages 
the demand for bga stacks has been hindered by the availability of other competitive solutions  including dual die and planar technologies 
in addition  the price differential between mbit devices and gbit devices declined during  temporarily reducing a key value proposition associated with stacking the mbit packages 
these declines have been partially offset by an increase in flash based stacks and by million in revenue from our southland acquisition for the last four months of license revenue decreased million during  compared with  which was mainly the result of decreased royalties from samsung 
the samsung license is for our leaded package technologies  which are being replaced over time by bga technologies 
product revenue increased during  compared to  primarily due to an increase in demand for our high performance stakpak 
revenue increased as the demand for this package type increased in the server market 
license revenue decreased million during  compared with  due primarily to decreased royalty revenue from samsung

gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue 
this amount represents a decrease of million  compared to gross profit of million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  the reduction in our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue during  compared to  was primarily due to lower gross margin on our product business resulting from fixed costs being spread over fewer units 
additionally  license revenue  for which there was no corresponding impact on our cost of revenue  declined by million 
the acquisition of southland further contributed to the decline in gross margin as a percentage of total revenue due to higher material costs associated with the sale of memory modules relative to memory stacking 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue 
this amount represents an increase of million  compared to gross profit of million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in our gross profit for was primarily the result of a million net decrease in the amortization of acquisition intangibles and the stock based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenue 
gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was reduced by percentage points during due to the amortization of acquisition intangibles and stock based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenue  compared with a percentage point impact of these items in overall gross profit during additionally  while license revenue  for which there was not any corresponding impact on our cost of revenue  declined by million  product revenue increased by million while the costs associated with product revenue increased by million 
the combination of these factors resulted in a million increase in gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue 
this amount reflected an increase of million  or  compared to selling  general and administrative expense of million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  selling  general and administrative expense included stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense during  relative to  was primarily due to increased personnel related costs in connection with our acquisition of southland 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue 
this amount reflected a decrease of million  or  compared to selling  general and administrative expense of million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  and  selling  general and administrative expense included stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively 
the reduction in selling  general and administrative expense during relative to was primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million and a reduction in directors and officers insurance costs of million  partially offset by an increase in personnel costs of million 
research and development research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue  which reflected a decrease of million  or  compared with research and development expense of million  or of total revenue for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  research and development expense included stock based compensation expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expense during  compared to  mainly resulted from reductions in personnel related costs 
we intend to devote additional personnel and other resources to research and development in future periods to address market opportunities for advanced technologies 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue  which reflected an increase of million  or  compared with research and development expense of million  or of total revenue for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  research and development expense included stock based compensation expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in costs for the year resulted from expenditures associated with the development of our non leaded technologies  arcticore as well as other new product initiatives  and recording stock based compensation of million 
restructuring expense during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring expense of million as a result of changing our long term focus 
during the year ended december   we recorded million as a result of the continuing transfer of manufacturing from austin  texas to reynosa  mexico and a realignment of our organizational structure 
goodwill impairment based on our annual assessment on october   we determined that no impairment of goodwill existed 
the decline in our market capitalization during the fourth quarter of was an indicator of potential goodwill impairment  and because of this decline we undertook an assessment on december  to determine the fair value of our business associated with the goodwill 
as a result of that review  we have recorded a non cash charge of million for the write down of the goodwill related to our stacking business that austin ventures acquired in august the impairment charge reflects the changing business prospects for our stacking business  declining utilization of our processes by licensees and declining demand for our products 
critical estimates made in determining the fair value of our stacking business included expected future cash flows from licensing agreements and product sales  customer turnover and future overhead expenses 
management s best estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
amortization and impairment of acquisition intangibles during the year ended december   we amortized million of intangible assets resulting from the staktek and southland acquisitions  with million allocated to cost of revenue and million to operating expenses 
in  we expect to incur amortization expense of million  with million allocated to cost of revenue and million to operating expenses 
as of march   as a result of our customers increased use of competitive technologies and the associated uncertainty around our future revenue  we tested our trademark intangible asset for impairment 
as a result of our review  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  which is included in amortization and impairment of acquisition intangibles in cost of revenue 
as of march   we also determined that the trademark intangible asset had an estimated remaining useful life of four years 
during the second quarter of  we began amortizing the remaining balance of million over its estimated useful life in proportion to the estimated contribution to discounted cash flows during the four year period 
during the year ended december   we amortized million of intangible assets resulting from the staktek acquisition during the third quarter of  with million allocated to cost of revenue and million to operating expenses 
during the year ended december   we amortized million of intangible assets resulting from that acquisition  with million allocated to cost of revenue and million to operating expenses 
the acquisition intangibles were originally valued using various discounted cash flow methodologies 
as a result  each year the total annual amortization expense of these intangibles is scheduled to decline 
interest and other income expense interest and other income  net  for the years ended december  and  was million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest and other income  net was mainly due to the cash received during as a result of recycling scrapped material 
interest and other income  net  for the year ended december   was million  as compared to interest and other income  net of million for the year ended december  the increase in interest and other income  net  for versus was mainly due to an improved rate of return on investments 
benefit for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of  and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  our effective tax rate was and  respectively 
management has determined that it is not more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our net deferred tax asset 
as a result  we recorded a valuation allowance in of approximately million against our net deferred tax assets 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  our effective tax rate was and  respectively 
during  the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to recording the impairment of goodwill and the million valuation allowance 
during and  the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of  due primarily to the impact of certain stock based compensation expenses that were not tax deductible  in addition to other permanent items  including tax exempt interest income

 revenue product license total revenue gross profit net income loss liquidity and capital resources our contractual obligations at december  for the next five years are summarized as follows in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases capital leases total operating lease obligations above included rent commitments at december  for our corporate office and research and production facility located in austin  texas 
in addition  on september   we entered into a lease agreement with an entity owned by two current entorian employees former southland principals to lease our irvine facility for a term of three years 
the capital lease commitment at december  was for office equipment 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund these obligations 
as of december   we had no material future sales commitments to any of our customers 
as of december   we had working capital of million  including million of cash  cash equivalents and investments  compared to working capital of million  including million of cash  cash equivalents and investments as of december  the decline in our working capital was primarily due to million of cash used in the southland acquisition  net of cash acquired 
as of december   we had working capital of million  including million of cash  cash equivalents and investments  compared to working capital of million  including million of cash  cash equivalents and investments as of december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   and resulted primarily from our net loss adjusted by non cash expenses including the goodwill impairment of million and the change in accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   and resulted primarily from net loss adjusted by non cash expenses and the change in income taxes receivable payable partially offset by the change in inventories 
net cash provided by operating activities during was million and resulted primarily from net income adjusted by non cash expenses  partially offset by the change in deferred income taxes and income taxes receivable 
the net impact of the southland acquisition is accounted for under investing activities 
see note  southland acquisition  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detail of the balances acquired 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for investing activities during consisted primarily of the purchase of investment securities of million and the acquisition of southland  net of cash acquired of million  partially offset by sales of investment securities of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for investing activities during consisted primarily of the purchase of investment securities of million and additions to property  plant and equipment of million  partially offset by sales of investment securities of million 
investing activities during consisted primarily of the purchase of investment securities of million and additions to property  plant and equipment of million  partially offset by sales of investment securities of million 
net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december  was million  primarily due to the purchase of our common stock as part of our stock repurchase program for million 
net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december  was million  primarily due to the purchase of our common stock as part of our stock repurchase program for million  partially offset by the proceeds of million received from the issuance of our common stock under our employee stock plans 
net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december  was million  primarily due to the purchase of our common stock as part of our stock repurchase program for million 
on july   we amended our unsecured revolving credit agreement with guaranty bank the lender  under which we may borrow up to million at any given time through june  the credit agreement 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by entorian technologies lp other than nominal closing costs associated with implementing the agreement  there are no ongoing fees associated with this credit agreement unless we borrow 
the interest rate on borrowings outstanding is based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus between and or the commercial based rate minus between and  depending upon the amount of cash or liquid investments that we have on deposit with the lender 
we are required to maintain at least million on deposit with the lender during the term of the credit agreement 
as of december   we had on deposit this required amount and had not borrowed under this agreement 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants that preclude us  among other things  from making material changes to the nature and scope of our business  entering into liquidation  merger or consolidation agreements in which we would not be the surviving entity  acquiring another company or entity for which we would pay more than million  or incurring indebtedness in excess of million with a third party outside the scope of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring that our tangible net worth must be at least million and our unencumbered liquid assets must be at least million 
we must certify our compliance with these covenants while any advances remain outstanding under this agreement 
we believe that our current assets  including cash and cash equivalents  investments and expected cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations  our anticipated additions to property  plant and equipment and any share repurchases under our stock repurchase program for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need or elect to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year or to acquire other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise these funds by borrowing money or selling more stock to the public or to selected investors 
in addition  while we may not need additional funds  we may elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing more equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
critical accounting estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition and presentation 
we engage in transactions where we sell consigned inventory to third parties and where we provide licensees with inventory 
we evaluate these transactions and determine if the costs and revenue should be presented on a gross or net basis 
in making this determination  we primarily consider the following we are not adding value to the inventory through our manufacturing processes  we do not take risk of ownership of the inventory and our net revenue from the transaction is predefined 
in situations where these conditions are met  we net the expense of the inventory against the revenue from the transaction 
we recognize initial license fees when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license  we deliver the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties and collection is reasonably assured 
we may provide training and or other assistance to our licensees under the terms of the license agreement 
the amount of training or assistance provided is limited and incidental to the licensed technology 
in instances where training or other assistance is provided under the terms of a license agreement  the estimated fair value of such services is deferred until these services are provided 
the associated revenue is included in product revenue 
in instances where we provide training or other assistance that is considered inconsequential to the license agreement  the estimated fair value of the services is recognized in connection with the initial license fee and is included in license revenue 
royalty revenue from our license agreements is recognized in the quarter in which our licensees report royalties to us 
certain licensees do not provide us with forward estimates or current quarter information concerning their shipments 
because we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of royalties earned during the period in which these licensees actually ship products using our technologies  we do not recognize royalty revenue until the royalties are reported to us and the collection of these royalties is reasonably assured 
impairment of assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of losses on long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets are less than the carrying value of these assets  and accordingly  all or a portion of this carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are then measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to the carrying amounts 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of intangible assets require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected future cash flows from  and the expected life of  the intangible asset  as well as the appropriate discount rate 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of intangible assets represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  we could reach a different conclusion regarding whether an intangible asset is impaired and  if so  the amount of the impairment loss 
as of december   goodwill is our only intangible asset that is not amortized 
we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment as of october and periodically when indicators of impairment exist 
the goodwill impairment test requires judgment regarding the determination of fair value of the reporting unit  which we determined to be our company as a whole  and the determination of fair value of our assets and liabilities 
we periodically assess our goodwill for indications of impairment on a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is defined as a component of an entity for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management and discrete financial information is available 
based on our annual assessment on october   we determined that no impairment of goodwill existed 
the decline in our market capitalization during the fourth quarter of was an indicator of potential goodwill impairment  and because of this decline we undertook a review to determine the fair value of our business associated with the goodwill 
as a result of that review  we have recorded a non cash charge of million for the write down of the goodwill related to our stacking business that austin ventures acquired in august inventory and inventory reserves 
we value our inventory at a standard cost and review our inventory for quantities in excess of production requirements and for obsolescence 
we maintain a reserve for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventory as well as for inventory with a carrying value in excess of its market value 
a review of inventory on hand is made quarterly and a provision for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventory is recorded  if necessary 
the review is based on several factors including a current assessment of future product demand  historical experience  and market conditions 
if actual conditions are less favorable than those that we projected  additional inventory reserves may be required 
income taxes 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance 
we establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
our effective tax rate considers our judgment of expected tax liabilities in the various taxing jurisdictions  within which we are subject to tax as well as the realizability of deferred tax assets 
the recorded amounts of income tax are subject to adjustment upon audit  changes in interpretation and changes in judgment utilized in determining estimates 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method and  therefore  we did not restate prior periods results 
under this method  we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after january   as well as those granted prior to but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest 
prior to sfas r adoption  we accounted for share based payments under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from the amount we have recorded in the current period 
southland earn out consideration 
as part of the purchase of southland  we offered compensation of up to million to the sellers if certain financial goals are achieved over the two years subsequent to closing the acquisition 
we must estimate  on a quarterly basis  if these goals will be met  but final determination of achieving the goals will only be known on the first and second anniversary dates of the effective date 
as a result  from quarter to quarter  changes in our estimates could result in reversing or recognizing significant amounts of compensation expense 
in addition  the sellers may elect to receive payment in either cash or stock 
we must  based on our current stock price compared to the earn out exercise price  predict which form of payment the sellers will elect to receive 
if our stock price is not an accurate indicator of the sellers eventual election  our total liabilities could be misstated 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in united states generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  which delayed the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this standard allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the fair value option may be elected on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable  unless a new election date occurs 
if the fair value option is elected for an instrument  sfas specifies that unrealized gains and losses for that instrument shall be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations  sfas r 
this standard establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  including goodwill  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the impact of adopting sfas r will be dependent on the future business combinations that we may pursue after its effective date 
subsequent events effective february   the company changed its name from staktek holdings  inc to entorian technologies inc 
in connection with the change in corporate name  effective february   the ticker symbol for the company s common stock changed to entn 
the change in the company s name to entorian technologies inc was effected by means of a merger pursuant to section of the delaware general corporation law  of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company formed solely for the purpose of implementing the name change with and into the company  with the company continuing as the surviving company 
in connection with the merger  article i of the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation was amended at the effective time of the merger to reflect the new corporate name  and the company s by laws were amended to replace all references to staktek holdings  inc with entorian technologies inc 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
most of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
the functional currency of our subsidiaries in mexico is the us dollar 
as a result  we have very little exposure to currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if we believe that our currency exposure has increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to help mitigate that risk 
interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the related income without significantly increasing risk 
even so  some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our interest income 
as of december   all of our cash was held in deposit or money market accounts  or invested in investment grade securities 
at december   we had amounts on deposit with financial institutions that were in excess of the federally insured limit of  we have not experienced any losses on deposits of cash and cash equivalents
