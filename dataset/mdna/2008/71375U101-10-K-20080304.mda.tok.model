you should read the following summary together with the more detailed business information and consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report and in the documents that we incorporate by reference into this annual report 
this annual report may contain certain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this information involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors 
overview we are an information technology consulting firm serving forbes global global and large enterprise companies primarily in the united states 
we help clients gain competitive advantage by using internet based technologies to make their businesses more responsive to market opportunities and threats  strengthen relationships with customers  suppliers and partners  improve productivity and reduce information technology costs 
our solutions enable these benefits by integrating  automating and extending business processes  technology infrastructure and software applications end to end within an organization and with key partners  suppliers and customers 
this provides real time access to critical business applications and information and a scalable  reliable  secure and cost effective technology infrastructure 
services revenues services revenues are derived from professional services performed developing  implementing  integrating  automating and extending business processes  technology infrastructure and software applications 
most of our projects are performed on a time and materials basis  and a smaller amount of revenues is derived from projects performed on a fixed fee basis 
fixed fee engagements represented approximately of our services revenues for the year ended december  for time and material projects  revenues are recognized and billed by multiplying the number of hours our professionals expend in the performance of the project by the established billing rates 
for fixed fee projects  revenues are generally recognized using the proportionate performance method 
revenues on uncompleted projects are recognized on a contract by contract basis in the period in which the portion of the fixed fee is complete 
amounts invoiced to clients in excess of revenues recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
the company s average bill rates increased slightly from per hour in to per hour in the company is anticipating modest increases in billing rates in on most projects  we are also reimbursed for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  lodging and meals 
these reimbursements are included as a component of revenues 
the aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will fluctuate depending on the location of our customers  the total number of our projects that require travel  and whether our arrangements with our clients provide for the reimbursement of travel and other project related expenses 
software revenues software revenues are derived from sales of third party software 
revenues from sales of third party software are recorded on a gross basis provided we act as a principal in the transaction 
in the event we do not meet the requirements to be considered a principal in the software sale transaction and act as an agent  the revenues are recorded on a net basis 
software revenues are expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on our customers demand for software products 
if we enter into contracts for the sale of services and software  company management evaluates whether the services are essential to the functionality of the software and whether the company has objective fair value evidence for each deliverable in the transaction 
if management concludes the services to be provided are not essential to the functionality of the software and can determine objective fair value evidence for each deliverable of the transaction  then we account for each deliverable in the transaction separately  based on the relevant revenue recognition policies 
generally  all deliverables of our multiple element arrangements meet these criteria 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of cash and non cash compensation and benefits associated with our technology professionals and subcontractors 
non cash compensation includes stock compensation expenses arising from restricted stock and option grants to employees 
cost of revenues also includes third party software costs  reimbursable expenses and other unreimbursed project related expenses 
project related expenses will fluctuate generally depending on outside factors including the cost and frequency of travel and the location of our customers 
cost of revenues does not include depreciation of assets used in the production of revenues which are primarily personal computers  servers and other it related equipment 
gross margins our gross margins for services are affected by the utilization rates of our professionals  defined as the percentage of our professionals time billed to customers divided by the total available hours in the respective period  the salaries we pay our consulting professionals and the average billing rate we receive from our customers 
if a project ends earlier than scheduled or we retain professionals in advance of receiving project assignments  or if demand for our services declines  our utilization rate will decline and adversely affect our gross margins 
subject to fluctuations resulting from our acquisitions  we expect these key metrics of our services business to remain relatively constant for the foreseeable future assuming there are no further declines in the demand for information technology software and services 
gross margin percentages of third party software sales are typically lower than gross margin percentages for services  and the mix of services and software for a particular period can significantly impact total combined gross margin percentage for such period 
in addition  gross margin for software sales can fluctuate due to pricing and other competitive pressures 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a consist of salaries  benefits  bonuses  non cash compensation  office costs  recruiting  professional fees  sales and marketing activities  training  and other miscellaneous expenses 
non cash compensation includes stock compensation expenses related to restricted stock and option grants to employees and non employee directors 
we work to minimize selling costs by focusing on repeat business with existing customers and by accessing sales leads generated by our software business partners  most notably ibm  whose products we use to design and implement solutions for our clients 
these partnerships enable us to reduce our selling costs and sales cycle times and increase win rates through leveraging our partners marketing efforts and endorsements 
a substantial portion of our sg a costs are relatively fixed 
plans for growth and acquisitions our goal is to continue to build one of the leading independent information technology consulting firms in north america by expanding our relationships with existing and new clients  leveraging our operations to expand nationally and continuing to make disciplined acquisitions 
we believe the united states represents an attractive market for growth  primarily through acquisitions 
as demand for our services grows  we believe we will attempt to increase the number of professionals in our north american offices and to add new offices throughout the united states  both organically and through acquisitions 
we also intend to continue to leverage our existing offshore capabilities to support our growth and provide our clients flexible options for project delivery

critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  purchase accounting allocation  accounting for stock based compensation  deferred income taxes and estimating the related valuation allowance 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts revenues are primarily derived from professional services provided on a time and materials basis 
for time and material contracts  revenues are recognized and billed by multiplying the number of hours expended in the performance of the contract by the established billing rates 
for fixed fee projects  revenues are generally recognized using the proportionate performance method based on the ratio of hours expended to total estimated hours 
billings in excess of costs plus earnings are classified as deferred revenues 
on many projects the company is also reimbursed for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  lodging and meals 
these reimbursements are included as a component of revenues 
revenues from software sales are recorded on a gross basis based on the company s role as principal in the transaction 
revenues are recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of the customer arrangement exists  fees are fixed and determinable  delivery and acceptance have occurred  and collectibility is deemed probable 
the company s policy for revenue recognition in instances where multiple deliverables are sold contemporaneously to the same counterparty is in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
specifically  if the company enters into contracts for the sale of services and software  then the company evaluates whether the services are essential to the functionality of the software and whether it has objective fair value evidence for each deliverable in the transaction 
if the company has concluded that the services to be provided are not essential to the functionality of the software and it can determine objective fair value evidence for each deliverable of the transaction  then it accounts for each deliverable in the transaction separately  based on the relevant revenue recognition policies 
generally  all deliverables of the company s multiple element arrangements meet these criteria 
the company follows the guidelines discussed above in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenues recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenues recognized for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of likely and probable losses 
each accounting period  we evaluate accounts receivable for risk associated with a client s inability to make contractual payments or unresolved issues with the adequacy of our services 
billed and unbilled receivables that are specifically identified as being at risk are provided for with a charge to revenue or bad debts as appropriate in the period the risk is identified 
we use considerable judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of the client  evaluating the successful mitigation of service delivery disputes  and gauging current market conditions 
if our evaluation of service delivery issues or a client s ability to pay is incorrect  we may incur future reductions to revenue or bad debt expense 
goodwill  other intangible assets and impairment of long lived assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  or net liabilities assumed  in a business combination 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill 
the company evaluates goodwill at the enterprise level as of october each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
as required by sfas  the impairment test is accomplished using a two stepped approach 
the first step screens for impairment and  when impairment is indicated  a second step is employed to measure the impairment 
the company also reviewed other factors to determine the likelihood of impairment 
no impairment was indicated using data as of october  other intangible assets include customer relationships  non compete arrangements and internally developed software  and are being amortized over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
estimated useful lives range from three to eight years 
amortization of customer relationships  non compete arrangements and internally developed software are considered operating expenses and are included in amortization of intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its identifiable intangible assets  taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in a lack of recoverability or revised useful life 
purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
some of the items  including accounts receivable  property and equipment  other intangible assets  certain accrued liabilities  and other reserves require a high degree of management judgment 
certain estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
goodwill is assigned at the enterprise level and is deductible for tax purposes for certain types of acquisitions 
the purchase price is allocated to intangibles based on management s estimate and an independent valuation 
management finalizes the purchase price allocation within twelve months of the acquisition date as certain initial accounting estimates are resolved 
accounting for stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  on january   using the modified prospective application transition method 
sfas no 
r requires that the costs of employee share based payments be measured at fair value on the awards grant date and recognized in the financial statements over the requisite service period 
the company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
however  certain assumptions used in the black scholes model  such as expected term  can be adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the company s stock option awards 
option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected term 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
restricted stock awards are valued at the price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
prior to january   the company accounted for share based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations and elected the disclosure option of sfas no 
sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

sfas no 
required that companies either recognize compensation expense for grants of stock  stock options and other equity instruments based on fair value  or provide pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share in the notes to the financial statements 
accordingly  the company measured compensation expense for stock options as the excess  if any  of the estimated fair market value of the company s stock at the date of grant over the exercise price 
the company provided pro forma effects of this measurement in a footnote to its financial statements for the year ended december  income taxes to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  income tax expense at interim reporting dates requires us to estimate our expected effective tax rate for the entire year 
this involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  the revised statement will require that transaction costs be expensed instead of recognized as purchase price 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas r on its consolidated financial statements

fsp in february  which delayed the effective date of sfas for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the effect  if any  of sfas and does not expect that the pronouncement will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued financial accounting standards interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

the company adopted the provisions of fin on january  as required and such adoption did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the eitf ratified eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf

the company adopted eitf on january  there was no effect of the adoption on the consolidated financial statements as of december  the company presents revenues net of taxes as disclosed in note  summary of significant accounting policies 
off balance sheet arrangements the company currently has no off balance sheet arrangements  except operating lease commitments as disclosed in note  commitments and contingencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to market risks is immaterial 
exchange rate sensitivity during the year ended december   million and million of our total revenues were attributable to our canadian operations and revenues generated in europe  respectively 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates primarily arises from short term intercompany transactions with our canadian  chinese  and india subsidiaries and from client receivables denominated in other than our functional currency 
our foreign subsidiaries incur a significant portion of their expenses in their applicable currency as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
based on the amount of revenues attributed to clients in canada  and europe during the year ended december   this exchange rate risk will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million at december  and december   respectively 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income
