item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis  particularly with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should read risk factors in item a of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of recombinant therapeutic proteins based on procellex  our proprietary protein expression system 
using our procellex protein expression system  we are developing a pipeline of proprietary recombinant therapeutic proteins based on our plant cell based expression technology that target large  established pharmaceutical markets and that rely upon known biological mechanisms of action 
our initial commercial focus has been mainly on complex therapeutic proteins  including proteins for the treatment of genetic disorders  such as gaucher disease and fabry disease  and on female infertility disorders 
we believe our procellex protein expression system will enable us to develop proprietary recombinant proteins that are therapeutically equivalent or superior to existing recombinant proteins currently marketed for the same indications 
because we are targeting biologically equivalent ve rsions of highly active  well tolerated and commercially successful therapeutic proteins  we believe our development process is associated with relatively less risk compared to other biopharmaceutical development processes for completely novel therapeutic proteins 
our lead product development candidate is prgcd for the treatment of gaucher disease  which we are developing using our procellex protein expression system 
we received approval from the fda in april to commence a pivotal phase iii clinical trial of prgcd and subsequently submitted to the fda a request for a special protocol assessment spa of the final design of the pivotal phase iii clinical trial 
in july  we reached an agreement with the fda on the final design that we submitted in the spa request and in the third quarter of we initiated enrollment and treatment of patients in our phase iii clinical trial of prgcd 
prgcd is our proprietary recombinant form of glucocerebrosidase gcd  an enzyme naturally found in human cells that is mutated or deficient in patients with gaucher disease 
the current standard of care for gaucher disease is enzyme replacement therapy  a medical treatment in which gcd is replaced for patients in wh om the enzyme is lacking or dysfunctional 
although gaucher is a relatively rare disease  it represents a large commercial market due to the severity of the symptoms and the chronic nature of the disease 
the annual worldwide sales of cerezyme  an enzyme replacement therapy produced by genzyme and currently the only approved enzyme replacement therapy for gaucher disease  were approximately billion in  according to public reports by genzyme 
in addition to prgcd  we are developing an innovative product pipeline using our procellex protein expression system  including therapeutic protein candidates for the treatment of fabry disease and female infertility disorders 
we are also developing an acetylcholinesterase enzyme based therapy for biodefense and intoxication treatments 
we plan to file an investigational new drug application ind with the fda with respect to at least one additional product during the second half of because these product candidates are based on well understood proteins with known biological mechanisms of action  we believe we may be able to reduce the development risks and time to market for such product candidates 
we hold the worldwide commercialization rights to our proprietary development candidates and we intend to establish an internal  commercial infrastructure and targeted sales force to market our products  if approved  in north america  the european union and in other significant markets  including israel 
our business is conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  protalix ltd  which we acquired through a reverse merger transaction effective december  the accounting treatment for the 
table of contents merger transaction was a recapitalization and as such the results of operations discussed below are those of protalix ltd 
prior to the merger transaction  we had not conducted any operations for several years 
protalix ltd 
was originally incorporated in israel in december since its inception in december  protalix ltd 
has generated significant losses in connection with its research and development  including the clinical development of prgcd 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
since we do not generate revenue from any of our product candidates  we expect to continue to generate losses in connection with the continued clinical development of prgcd and the research and development activities relating to our technology and other drug candidates 
such research and development activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
as a result  we believe that our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
we will need to obtain additional funds for the commercialization of our lead product  prgcd  and to further develop the research and clinical development of our other programs 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report 
we believe that the accounting policies below are critical for one to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which we prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate such estimates and judgments  including those described in greater detail below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimate s under different assumptions or conditions 
functional currency the currency of the primary economic environment in which our operations are conducted is the dollar 
as a development stage company with no significant source of revenues  we considered the currency of the primary economic environment to be the currency in which we expend cash 
most of our expenses and capital expenditures are incurred in dollars  and a significant source of our financing has been provided in us dollars 
research and development expense we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to develop our product candidates 
research and development expense consists of

facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  as well as laboratory and other supplies 

table of contents these costs and expenses are partially funded by grants we received from the ocs 
each grant is deducted from the related research and development expenses as the costs are incurred 
for additional information regarding the grant process  see business israeli government programs encouragement of industrial research and development law  in item of this annual report 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive grants from the ocs in amounts sufficient for our operations  if at all 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs  including share based compensation expense  for persons serving as our executive  finance  accounting and administration functions 
other general and administrative expense includes facility related costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  costs associated with industry and trade shows and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we add additional personnel and continue to comply with the reporting and other obligations applicable to public companies in the united states 
from inception in december through december   we have spent million on general and administrative expense  including share based compensation expense of million for options granted to employees and consultants

share based compensation the discussion below regarding share based compensation relates to share based compensation paid by protalix ltd  our wholly owned subsidiary 
until december   we accounted for employee share based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of the grant  between the fair value of our ordinary shares and the exercise price 
in addition  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we disclosed pro forma data assuming we had accounted for employee share option grants using the fair value based method defined in sfas we apply emerging issue task force eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services with respect to options granted in consideration of services performed by consultants 
in accordance with eitf  we record the benefit of any grant to a non employee and remeasure the benefit in any future vesting period for the unvested portion of the grants  as applicable 
in addition  we use the straight line accounting method for recording the benefit of the entire grant  unlike the graded method we use to record grants made to employees 
as of january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective method 
this new standard requires measurement of share based compensation cost for all share based awards at the fair value on the grant date and recognition of share based compensation over the service period for awards that we expect will vest 
the fair value of stock options is determined based on the number of shares granted and the price of 
table of contents our ordinary shares  and calculated based on the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
we recognize such value as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the accelerated method under sfas r 
due to our adoption of sfas r  we no longer have employee share based compensation awards subject to variable accounting treatment 
the cumulative effect of our adoption of sfas r  as of january   was not material 
protalix ltd 
had multiple classes of stock before the conversion of all preferred shares into ordinary shares in september through december   protalix ltd 
considered the three commonly used methods described by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  and determined that the probability weighted expected return method is the appropriate method to value its securities 
we chose this method because it is forward looking and incorporates future economic events and outcomes into the determination of value at the time of calculation 
the method is limited  as are all forward looking methods  in that it relies on a number of assumptions 
under the probability weighted expected return method  the value of the ordinary shares of protalix ltd 
is estimated based upon an analysis of future values for the enterprise assuming various future outcomes 
share value is based upon the probability weighted present value of expected future investment returns  considering each of the possible future outcomes available to the enterprise  as well as the rights of each share class 
although the future outcomes considered in any given valuation model will vary based upon the enterprise s facts and circumstances  common future outcomes modeled might include an initial public offering  merger or sale  dissolution or continued operation as a viable private enterprise 
the probability weighted expected return method analysis presents value afforded to shareholders under four possible scenarios 
three of the scenarios assume a shareholder realization  either through an initial public offering  sale  merger or liquidation 
the last scenario assumes operations continue as a private company and no realization transaction occurs 
fair value calculations of the ordinary shares of protalix ltd 
were performed for dates close to the dates on which preferred shares were issued to third parties 
we considered the issuance price of each series of preferred shares to third parties in the calculation of the fair value of the ordinary shares 
for each of the first three realization scenarios  estimated future and present values for each of the share classes were calculated utilizing assumptions which consisted of the following

an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
for purposes of determining the fair value of the options and shares of restricted common stock granted to employees and non employees  our management uses the fair value of our common stock 
for purposes of determining the fair value of the outstanding options held by non employees that vested during the fiscal quarter ended march   our management evaluated the fair value of our common stock based on a retrospective valuation of the fair value of our common stock at march   conducted by a third party specialist 
the valuation specialist used various valuation methodologies and determined retrospectively that the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the options granted to consultants and non employees at march  was per share 
our management did not rely on the available market prices for this purpose as our management concluded that an active market for our common stock did not exist for such periods 
for purposes of determining the fair value of the options and shares of restricted common stock granted to employees and non employees during the fiscal quarter ended june   our 
table of contents management used the closing sale price of our common stock on the american stock exchange on the appropriate date 
on june   the last trading day of the fiscal quarter ended june   the closing sale price of our common stock on the american stock exchange was per share 
the common stock was first included for listing on the american stock exchange on march  for purposes of determining the fair value of the outstanding options and shares of restricted common stock held by non employees that vested during the fiscal quarter ended september   our management used per share  which was the public offering price of the shares of common stock sold in the underwritten public offering we completed on october  our management did not rely on the available market prices for this purpose as management concluded that the offering price better reflected the fair value of our common stock 
for purposes of determining the fair value of options and shares of restricted common stock granted and held by non employees that vested during the fiscal quarter ended december   our management used the closing sale price of our common stock on the american stock exchange on the appropriate date 
sfas r allows companies to estimate the expected term of the option rather than simply using the contractual term of an option 
because of lack of data on past option exercises by employees  the expected term of the options could not be based on historic exercise patterns 
accordingly  we adopted the simplified method as stipulated in the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment sab  according to which companies may calculate the expected term as the average between the vesting date and the expiration date  assuming the option was granted as a plain vanilla option 
sab defines plain vanilla share options as those having the following characteristics

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
share options are granted at the money  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer

exercisability is conditional only on performing service through the vesting date  
spacer

spacer

spacer

if an employee terminates service prior to vesting  the employee forfeits the share options  
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
if an employee terminates service after vesting  the employee has a limited period of time typically days to exercise the share options  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
share options are nontransferable and nonhedgeable 
all of the outstanding options granted by protalix ltd 
were granted at an exercise price that was lower than the then share price 
accordingly  we assumed that the exercise period will on average be shorter than the average period between the vesting and the expiration of the options 
however  due to the lack of information regarding exercise behavior  we implemented the methodology proposed above for the calculation of the expected term for all grants including those that were in the money 
in performing the valuation  we assumed an expected dividend yield in the previous years and in the next years 
we do not have a dividend policy and given our development stage  dividends are not expected in the foreseeable future  if at all 
sfas r stipulates a number of factors that should be considered when estimating the expected volatility  including the implied volatility of traded options  historical volatility and the period that the shares of the company are being publicly traded 
as we do not have any traded shares or options  the expected volatility figures used in this valuation have been calculated by using the historical volatility of traded shares of similar companies 
in addition  we examined the standard deviation of shares of similar biotechnology companies that engage in research and development  generally in the development stage 
we found that the standard deviation of the shares of comparable companies was in the range of over periods of three to six years 
the volatility used for each grant differed based on its expected term 
for the term of each grant of our options  the historical volatility was calculated based upon the overall trading history of the common stock of comparable companies 
the risk free interest rate in the table above has been based on the implied yield of us federal reserve zero coupon government bonds 
the remaining term of the bonds used for each valuation was equal to the expected term of the grant 
this methodology has been applied to all grants valued 
table of contents by us 
sfas r requires the use of a risk free interest rate based on the implied yield currently available on zero coupon government issues of the country in whose currency the exercise price is expressed  with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option being valued 
this requirement has been applied for all grants valued as part of this report

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as a result of our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate product sales revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since our inception 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds equal to million from the sale of our shares of common stock and from sales of convertible preferred and ordinary shares of protalix ltd  and an additional million in connection with the exercise of warrants issued in connection with the sale of such ordinary shares  through december  in addition  on october   we generated gross proceeds of million in connection with an underwritten public offering of our common stock

future funding requirements we expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
we expect to incur increasing research and development expenses  including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and additional clinical trials 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will also increase as we expand our finance and administrative staff  add infrastructure  and incur additional costs related to being a public company in the united states  including the costs of directors and officers insurance  investor relations programs and increased professional fees 
in addition  we are considering a new manufacturing facility that would meet the fda requirements for the manufacture of our product candidates  which would increase our capital expenditures significantly 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least for the next months 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that are subject to change and may prove to be wrong  and we may be required to use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress and results of our clinical trials  the duration and cost of discovery and preclinical development  and laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates  the timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue and the costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution 
we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we currently do not have any commitments for future external funding 
we may need to raise additional funds more quickly if one 
table of contents or more of our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our product development efforts more rapidly than we presently anticipate 
we may also decide to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities will likely result in dilution to our shareholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
additional equity or debt financing  grants or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
effects of inflation and currency fluctuations inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   or currency fluctuations could affect us by increased or decreased costs mainly for goods and services acquired outside of israel 
we do not believe currency fluctuations have had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   or off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and see note of the consolidated financial statements for a full description of certain contingent royalty payments

sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years january   for our company 
in february  the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its results of operations and fina ncial position 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas is expected to expand the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards that require certain assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
the objective of sfas is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under sfas  a company may choose  at its initial application or at other specified election dates  to measure eligible items at fair value and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years january   for our company 
if we elect the fair value option for our existing assets and liabilities  the effect  as of the adoption date  shall be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we do not expect to elect the fair value option to our existing assets and liabilities and thus the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position

sfas requires that changes in a parent company s ownership interest while the parent company retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary should be accounted for in a manner similar to the accounting treatment of equity transactions 
when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary should be initially measured at fair value  with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
sfas requires consolidated net income to be reported in amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent company and the noncontrolling interest 
it also requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated income statement  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to both parent companies and the noncontrolling interests 
sfas is effective for fiscal years including interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
sfas is required to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirement which shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
we are required to adopt sfas as of january  we are currently assessing the impact that sfas may have on its results of operations and financial position in december  the fasb ratified eitf issue no

eitf defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties

eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  january   for our company 
companies are required to apply eitf using a modified version of retrospective transition for those arrangements in place at the effective date 
in addition  companies are required to report the effects of the application of eitf as a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods presented for all arrangements existing as of the effective date  unless 
table of contents it is impracticable to apply the effects of the change retrospectively 
we are currently assessing the impact that eitf may have on our results of operations and financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency exchange risk the currency of the primary economic environment in which our operations are conducted is the dollar 
we are currently in the development stage with no significant source of revenues  therefore we consider the currency of the primary economic environment to be the currency in which we expend cash 
approximately of our expenses and capital expenditures are incurred in dollars  and a significant source of our financing has been provided in us dollars 
since the dollar is the functional currency  monetary items maintained in currencies other than the dollar are remeasured using the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates and non monetary items are remeasured at historical exchange rates 
revenue and expense items are remeasured at the average rate of exchange in effect during the period in which they occur 
foreign currency translation gains or losses are recognized in the statement of operations 
approximately of our costs  including salaries  expenses and office expenses  are incurred in new israeli shekels  the nis 
inflation in israel may have the effect of increasing the us dollar cost of our operations in israel 
if the us dollar declines in value in relation to the nis  it will become 
table of contents more expensive for us to fund our operations in israel 
a revaluation of of the nis will affect our income before tax by less than 
the exchange rate of the us dollar to the nis  based on exchange rates published by the bank of israel  was as follows

to date  we have not engaged in hedging transactions 
in the future  we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the nis 
these measures  however  may not adequately protect us from material adverse effects due to the impact of inflation in israel 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash and cash equivalents 
we consider all short term  highly liquid investments  which include short term deposits with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase  that are not restricted as to withdrawal or use and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash  to be cash equivalents 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the interest income we receive from our investments  without increasing risk 
we invest any cash balances primarily in bank deposits and investment grade interest bearing instruments 
we are exposed to market risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to interest rate risk 
our interest gains may decline in the future as a result of changes in the financial markets
