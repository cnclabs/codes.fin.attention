ebitda is a measure of operating performance that is not calculated in accordance with gaap 
ebitda should not be considered a substitute for net income  income from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations  as determined in accordance with gaap 
ebitda is a key measure of our operating performance used by management to focus on consolidated operating performance exclusive of income and expense that relate to the financing and capitalization of the business 
we define ebitda as income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense and depreciation and amortization 
we use ebitda to assess our consolidated financial 
table of contents and operating performance  and we believe this non measure  is helpful in identifying trends in our performance 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
ebitda provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
the table below shows the reconciliation of net income loss to ebitda for the period october through december  and the years ended december   and

overview we are a global company that acquires and leases high utility commercial jet aircraft to passenger and cargo airlines throughout the world 
high utility aircraft are generally modern  operationally efficient jets with a large operator base and long useful lives 
as of december   our aircraft portfolio consisted of aircraft that were leased to lessees located in countries  including two aircraft being converted to freighter configuration which are subject to leases that will commence upon completion of the conversions  and managed through our offices in the united states  ireland and singapore 
typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational  maintenance and insurance costs  although  in a majority of cases  we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs 
we also make investments in other aviatio n assets  including debt investments secured by commercial jet aircraft 
as of february   we had acquired and committed to acquire aviation assets having an aggregate purchase price equal to billion and billion  respectively  for a total of approximately billion 
our revenues and income from continuing operations for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively 
for the fourth quarter of  our revenues and income from continuing operations were million and million  respectively 
we intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders and plan to grow our dividends per share through the acquisition of additional aviation assets using cash on hand and available credit facilities 
we expect to finance our acquisitions on a long term basis using cost effective debt structures such as non recourse securitizations or similar bank market financings 
securitizations and similarly structured bank market financings allow companies to raise long term capital by pledging cash flows of an asset pool  such as aircraft leases 
in june  we closed our first securitization  which we refer to as securitization no 
 a million transaction comprising aircraft and related leases  which were refer to as portfolio no 
in june  we closed our second securitization  which we refer to as securitization no 
 a billion transaction comprising aircraft and related leases  which we refer to as portfolio no 
we expect that long term debt to refinance our short term borrowings and to fund additional investments would also be available to us in the secured bank debt market under a broadly similar security structure 
segments we manage our business and analyze and report our results of operations on the basis of two business segments  aircraft leasing and debt investments 
we present our segment information on a contribution margin basis consistent with the information that our chief executive officer the chief operating decision maker reviews in assessing segment performance and allocating resources 

table of contents contribution margin includes revenue  depreciation  interest expense and other expenses that are directly connected to our business segments 
we believe contribution margin is an appropriate measure of performance because it reflects the marginal profitability of our business segments  excluding overhead 
aircraft leasing typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational and insurance costs 
in many of our leases we are obligated to bear a portion of maintenance costs or costs associated with modifications required by manufacturers or regulators 
we retain the benefit  and bear the risk  of re leasing and the residual value of the aircraft upon expiry or early termination of the lease 
as of december   our portfolio consisted of aircraft with lessees in countries  including two aircraft being converted to freighter configuration which are subject to leases that will commence upon completion of the conversions  with a net book value of billion 
the weighted average by net book value age of the aircraft in the portfolio from the date of original delivery by manufacturer to december   was years 
the weighted average by net book value remaining lease term for aircraft we owned at december  was years 
debt investments we also invest in debt investments secured by commercial jet aircraft  including enhanced equipment trust certificates  and other forms of collateralized debt 
we believe our experience in the aircraft leasing business  coupled with knowledge of structured finance  enables us to make opportunistic investments in this market sector 
our intent is not to actively trade debt investments  and accordingly we have classified debt investments purchased to date as available for sale or held to maturity as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
as of december   we owned debt investments secured by aircraft with a fair value of million 
during the year ended december   we made one additiona l investment in debt investments secured by aviation assets 
at december   our debt investment portfolio consisted of seven such debt investments with a fair value of million 
in february  we sold two of our debt investments for million  plus accrued interest 
we repaid the outstanding balance of million  plus accrued interest  under the related repurchase agreement 
additionally  we terminated the related interest rate swap and paid breakage fees and accrued interest of approximately million 
revenues revenues in our aircraft leasing segment are comprised primarily of operating lease rentals on flight equipment held for lease 
the amount of rent we receive depends on various factors  including the type  size and age of the aircraft in our portfolio 
lease rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
our aircraft lease agreements generally provide for the periodic payment of a fixed amount of rent over the life of the lease 
however  the amount of rent we receive may vary due to several factors  including the credit worthiness of our lessees and the occurrence of delinquencies and defaults 
our lease rental revenues are also affected by the extent to which aircraft are off lease and our ability to remarket aircraft that are nearing the end of their leases in order to minimize their off lease time 
our success in re leasing aircraft is affected by market conditions relating to our aircraft and by general industry trends 
an increase in the percentage of off lease aircraft or a reduction in lease rates upon remarketing would negatively impact our revenues 
revenues in our aircraft leasing segment for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
our revenues increased significantly from to primarily as a result of continued aircraft acquisitions during which caused our aircraft fleet to grow from aircraft at december   to aircraft at december   all of which were on lease or in freighter conversion 
revenues in our debt investments segment are recognized using the effective interest method 
certain investments which represent residual interests are accounted for using a level yield 
table of contents methodology based upon a number of cash flow assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
such assumptions include the rate and timing of principal and interest 
revenues in our debt investments segment for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  operating expenses operating expenses are comprised of depreciation of flight equipment held for lease  interest expense  selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  and other expenses 
as we continue to grow  we expect that depreciation of flight equipment held for lease and interest expense will grow with revenue growth 
we also expect that sg a will decline as a percentage of our segment assets and of our revenues as we leverage our existing infrastructure over a greater revenue base 
since our operating lease terms generally require the lessee to pay for operating  maintenance and insurance costs  our portion of other expenses relating to aircraft reflected in our statement of income has been nominal 
income tax provision we have obtained an assurance from the minister of finance of bermuda under the exempted undertakings tax protection act that  in the event that any legislation is enacted in bermuda imposing any tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  such tax shall not  until march   be applicable to us or to any of our operations or to our shares  debentures or other obligations except insofar as such tax applies to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda or to any taxes payable by us in respect of real property owned or leased by us in bermuda 
consequently  the provision for income taxes recorded relates to income earned by certain subsidiaries of the company which are located in or earn income in jurisdictions that impose income taxes  primarily ireland and the united states 
all of our aircraft owning subsidiaries that are recognized as corporations for us tax purposes are us corporations 
these non us subsidiaries generally earn income from sources outside the united states and therefore typically are not subject to us federal  state or local income taxes 
however  certain of these non us subsidiaries own aircraft that operate to  from or within the us and therefore may be subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
we also have a u 
s based subsidiary which provides management services to our non us subsidiaries and is subject to non us federal  state and local income taxes 
history aircastle limited  formerly aircastle investment limited  is a bermuda exempted company that was incorporated on october  by fortress investment group llc and certain of its affiliates 
acquisitions and dispositions our financial results are impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions and dispositions we complete 
as of february   we had acquired and committed to acquire aviation assets having an aggregate purchase price equal to billion and billion  respectively  or a total of approximately billion 
we believe the large and growing aircraft market continues to evolve  generating significant additional acquisition opportunities 
our acquisition strategy is flexible and allows us to take advantage of the best available market opportunities and is predicated on sourcing investments we believe to be accretive to shareholders 
currently  we are primarily focused on acquiring high utility commercial jet aircraft for the passenger and freighter markets and we may also make opportunistic acquisitions of other asset backed aviation assets 
our business strategy has been to pursue acquisitions through multiple channels across the world  such as sale leasebacks with airlines and 
table of contents purchases from operating lessors  banks and other aircraft owning entities 
we also explore opportunities to purchase aircraft from manufacturers 
our ability to successfully and efficiently acquire and integrate additional aviation assets on favorable terms will significantly impact our financial results and growth prospects 
on january   we entered into the gaif acquisition agreement  pursuant to which we agreed to acquire aircraft for an aggregate base purchase price of approximately billion  subject to certain agreed adjustments 
on november   we agreed with gaif to remove two aircraft from the gaif acquisition agreement  reducing the total number of aircraft to be acquired to  with an aggregate base purchase price of approximately billion 
for certain of the aircraft  we agreed to make accelerated payments to the relevant sellers and acquire their rights and obligations under the seller s purchase or freighter conversion agreement  with final payment and delivery of the aircraft to us being made upon delivery by the manufacturer or seller  or completion of the conversion process 
we acquired aircraft in related to this transaction  and of the remaining eight aircraft  we expect to acquire seven in and one in february we have made accelerated payments to the relevant gaif seller in relation to certain of the aircraft remaining to be delivered in and on june   we entered into the airbus af agreement  under which we agreed to acquire from airbus fifteen new a f freighter aircraft  or the new af aircraft 
pre delivery payments for each aircraft are payable to airbus and are refundable to us only in limited circumstances 
we agreed to separate arrangements with rolls royce plc  or rolls royce  and pratt whitney  or p w  pursuant to which we committed to acquire aircraft engines for the new af aircraft 
we agreed to acquire six shipsets of trent b engines from rolls royce and were granted options to acquire an additional four shipsets 
we also committed to acquire five shipsets of pw engines from p w  and were granted options to acquire an additional five shipsets 
each shipset consists of two engines 
the new af aircraft are scheduled for delivery between june and november  with five scheduled for delivery in under limited circum stances  we have the right to change certain delivery positions from a f freighter configuration aircraft to a passenger configuration aircraft 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to the aircraft acquired or to be acquired by us as of december  aircastle aircraft information dollars in millions

finance a key aspect of our growth strategy is our flexible capital structure which supports the financing of our acquisitions of aircraft and other aviation assets 
we typically finance the initial purchase of aircraft and other aviation assets using committed short term credit arrangements and cash on hand 
we believe our ability to execute acquisitions expeditiously and without financing contingencies has benefited us in competitive bidding situations 
our short term borrowed funds for our aircraft acquisitions and repurchase obligations for our securities are provided by secured credit facilities from banks 
we intend to continue funding aircraft acquisitions initially through borrowings under our short term credit facilities  and to repay all or a portion of such borrowings from time to time with the net proceeds from subsequent long term debt financings and additional equity offerings 
therefore  our ability to execute our business strategy  particularly the acquisition of additional commercial jet aircraft or other aviation assets  depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain additional debt and equity capital on terms we deem attractive 
given our existing commitments and the potential volume of aircraft acquisitions  we expect to execute additional securitizations  other long term debt financing and or additional equity offerings during the course of the next months 
we also intend to extend  modify or replace our short term credit facilities in however  the level of new investment activity and  in turn  financing requirements will be drive n by the attractiveness of new investment opportunities available in the marketplace and financial market conditions 
decisions by investors and lenders to enter into such transactions with us will depend upon a number of factors  such as our historical and projected performance  compliance with the terms of our current credit arrangements  industry and market trends  the availability of capital and the relative attractiveness of alternative investments

sg a increased million for the year ended december   as compared with the same period in the increase was due to an increase of million in personnel costs  consisting primarily of salary and non cash share based payments  as the number of employees increased from at december   to at december   an increase in professional fees of million  consisting primarily of auditing and tax compliance fees  and a decrease in other expenses 
non cash share based payment expense of nbsp  million in included million of compensation resulting from the acceleration of unvested shares previously granted to a former employee

income tax provision our provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
income taxes have been provided based on the applicable tax laws and rates of those countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned  primarily ireland and the united states 
the increase in our income tax provision of approximately million from december  to december  was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating revenue subject to tax in ireland and the united states 
all of our aircraft owning subsidiaries that are recognized as corporations for us tax purposes are us corporations 
these non us subsidiaries generally earn income from sources outside the united states and therefore typically are not subject to us federal  state or local income taxes 
however  certain of these non us subsidiaries own aircraft that operate to  from or within the us and therefore may be subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
we also have a u 
s based subsidiary which provides management services to our non us subsidiaries and is subject to non us federal  state and local income taxes 
the company received an assurance from the bermuda minister of finance that it would be exempted from local income  withholding and capital gains taxes until march consequently  the provision for income taxes recorded relates to income earned by certain subsidiaries of the company which are located in or earn income in jurisdictions that impose income taxes  primarily the united states and ireland 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  effective january  fin addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and there was no effect on our financial condition or results of operations as a result of the adoption of fin our policy is that we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
as of the date of adoption of fin  we did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits  nor was any interest expense or penalty recognized during the year 
see note to our consolidated financial statements

table of contents application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and currently available information 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most subjective judgments  estimates and assumptions 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates are d escribed below 
lease revenue recognition our operating lease rentals are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
we will neither recognize revenue nor record a receivable from a customer when collectability is not reasonably assured 
estimating whether collectability is reasonably assured requires some level of subjectivity and judgment 
when collectability is not certain  the customer is placed on non accrual status and revenue is recognized when cash payments are received 
management determines whether customers should be placed on non accrual status 
when we are reasonably assured that payments will be received in a timely manner  the customer is placed on accrual status 
the accrual non accrual status of a customer is maintained at a level deemed appropriate based on factors such as the customer credit rating  payment performance  financial condition and requests for modifications of lease terms and conditions 
events or circumstances outside of historical customer patterns can also result in changes to a customer s accrual status 
income and valuation of debt investments income on debt investments is recognized using the effective interest method 
certain investments which represent a residual interest are accounted for using a level yield methodology based upon a number of cash flow assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
such assumptions include the rate and timing of principal and interest receipts which may be subject to prepayments and defaults 
these assumptions are updated on at least a quarterly basis to reflect changes related to a particular security  actual historical data and market changes 
these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events and economic and market conditions  which may alter the assumptions 
we have classified our investments in debt investments as available for sale or held to maturity as such  debt investments available for sale are carried at fair value with any net unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accum ulated other comprehensive income 
fair value is based primarily upon broker quotations  which provide valuation estimates based upon reasonable market order indications or a good faith estimate thereof 
these quotations are subject to significant variability based on market conditions  such as interest rates and credit spreads 
changes in market conditions  as well as changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value  could result in a significant increase or decrease in our results of operations and financial position 
at december   our portfolio of debt investments available for sale had a net unrealized gain 
maintenance payments under an operating lease  the lessee is typically required to make payments for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components of the aircraft 
these maintenance payments are based on hours or cycles of utilization or on calendar time  depending upon the component  and are required to be made monthly in arrears or at the end of the lease term 
whether to permit a lessee to make maintenance payments at the end of the lease term  rather than requiring such payments to be made monthly  depends on a variety of factors  including the creditworthiness of the lessee  the level of security deposit which may be provided by the lessee and 
table of contents market conditions at the time 
if a lessee is making monthly maintenance payments  we would typically be obligated to use the funds paid by the lessee during the lease term to reimburse the lessee for costs they incur for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components  usually shortly following completion of the relevant work 
in addition  many of our leases contain provisions which may require us to pay a portion of such costs in excess of the amounts paid to us by the lessee on a monthly basis  although the timing of the maintenance  overhaul or replacement of the relevant components and the actual cost of the work will determine the portion of the excess  if any  we must pay 
as part of our due diligence review of each aircraft we purchase  we prepare an estimate of the expected maintenance payments and any excess costs which may become payable by us  taking into consideration the then current maintenance status of the aircraft and the relevant provisions of any existing lease 
we record maintenance payments paid by the lessee as accrued maintenance liabilities in recognition of our contractual commitment to refund such receipts 
in these contracts  we do not recognize such maintenance payments as revenue during the lease 
reimbursements to the lessee upon the receipt of evidence of qualifying maintenance work are charged against the existing accrued maintenance liability 
we defer income recognition of all maintenance reserve payments collected until such time as we can reasonably estimate the amount by which reserve payments received exceed costs to be incurred by the current lessee or subsequent lessees in performing scheduled maintenance 
flight equipment held for lease flight equipment held for lease is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method  typically over a year life from the date of manufacture for passenger aircraft and over a year life for freighter aircraft  depending on whether the aircraft is a converted or purpose built freighter  to estimated residual values 
estimated residual values are generally determined to be approximately of the manufacturer s estimated realized price for passenger aircraft when new and for freighter aircraft when new 
management may make exceptions to this policy on a case by case basis when  in its judgment  the residual value calculated pursuant to this policy does not appear to reflect current expectations of value 
examples of situations where exceptions may arise include but are not limited to

flight equipment which may have a shorter useful life due to obsolescence 
in accounting for flight equipment held for lease  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  the fair value of attached leases and the estimated residual values 
in estimating useful lives  fair value of leases and residual values of our aircraft  we rely upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
determining the fair value of attached leases requires us to make assumptions regarding the current fair values of leases for specific aircraft 
we estimate a range of current lease rates of like aircraft in order to determine if the attached lease is within a fair value range 
if a lease is below or above the range of current lease rates  we present value the estimated amount below or above fair value range over the remaining term of the lease 
the resulting lease premiums or discounts are amortized into lease rental income over the remaining term of the lease 
our flight equipment held for lease is evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
indicators include third party appraisals of our aircraft  adverse changes in market conditions for specific aircraft types and the occurrence of significant adverse changes in general industry and market conditions that could affect the fair value of our aircraft 

table of contents derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business we utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
we account for derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  or sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no  all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
we obtain the values on a quarterly basis from the counterparty of the derivative contracts 
when hedge treatment is achieved under sfas no  the changes in fair values related to the effective portion of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income or in income  depending on the designation of the derivative as a cash flow hedge 
the ineffective portion of the d erivative contract is calculated and recorded in income at each quarter end 
at inception of the hedge  we choose a method of ineffectiveness calculation  which we must use for the life of the contract 
for a majority of our hedges  we use the change in variable cash flows method for calculation of hedges not considered to be perfectly effective 
in the case of swap transactions  the calculation involves a comparison of the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the variable leg of the swap and the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest cash flows on the floating rate liability 
the difference is the calculated ineffectiveness and is recorded in income 
we use the hypothetical trade method for hedges that do not qualify for the change in variable cash flow method under sfas no 
the calculation involves a comparison of the change in the fair value of a hypothetical trade to the change in the fair value of the hedge 
the difference is the calculated ineffectiveness and is recorded in income as a component of interest expense 
share based payments compensation costs relating to share based payments are recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued in accordance sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we use the straight line method of accounting for compensation cost on share based payment awards that contain pro rata vesting provisions  net of estimated forfeitures 
prior to our initial public offering  the fair value of the equity instruments was determined based on a valuation which took into account various assumptions that were subjective 
such assumptions involved projecting our earnings through the date of the anticipated initial public offering to develop an estimated annualized rate of earnings and annualized earnings and dividends per share 
key assumptions used in developing the projection included expected monthly acquisition vo lume through the date of the initial public offering  leverage and interest costs  revenues from new aircraft acquisitions and the growth of selling  general and administrative expenses 
compensation costs relating to share based payments recognized subsequent to the initial public offering are measured based upon the market price of our common shares at the grant date 
income taxes aircastle provides for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas no 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities using enacted rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount estimated by aircastle to be realizable 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no

principal and interest payments from our debt investments 
during the year ended december   we acquired commercial jet aircraft and made capital improvements to our aircraft portfolio totaling billion excluding assets not yet earning revenue of million comprising deposits and progress payments under our airbus af agreement and freighter conversion contracts and excluding payments under the gaif acquisition agreement for aircraft accelerations and million of debt investments secured by commercial jet aircraft  for a 
table of contents total of billion 
we expect to acquire a substantial amount of aviation assets over the next twelve months  including approximately million of aircraft to be delivered under the gaif acquisition agreement  all of which were subject to letters of intent at december   and additional acquisitions that we may enter into from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
in addition  at december   we expect capital expenditures and lessee maintenance payment draws on our owned and committed aircraft portfolio to be approximately million  excluding freighter conversion payments see purchase obligations in contractual obligations below and we expect maintenance payment collections from lessees on our owned aircraft portfolio of approximately million over the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire the additional aircraft described above  and no assurance regarding the t iming and amount of such acquisitions 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the capital expenditures described above will not be greater than expected or that our expected maintenance payment collections will equal our current estimates 
it is our intention to fund future aircraft acquisitions  including the aircraft to be acquired from gaif under the gaif acquisition agreement  initially through borrowings under our credit facilities  and to repay all or a portion of such borrowings from time to time with the net proceeds from subsequent securitizations or other long term debt financings and or additional equity issuances 
it is also our intention to finance investments in debt investments with borrowings arranged at the time of the investment which may include entering into repurchase agreements 
therefore  our ability to execute our business strategy  particularly the acquisition of additional commercial jet aircraft or other aviation assets  depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain additional debt and equity capital 
given the volume of aircraft acquisitions and opportunities to invest in debt investments  we expect to execute additional non recourse securitizations  similar bank market financings and or additional equity offerings during the course of the next months 
decisions by investors and lenders to enter into such transactions with us will depend upon a number of factors  such as our historical and projected performance  compliance with the terms of our current credit arrangements  industry and market trends  the availability of capital and the relative attractiveness of alternative investments 
we believe that funds available from operations and our credit facilities  including the a credit agreement  and including extensions  replacements and refinancings of our existing credit facilities  will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs over the next twelve months and enable us to pay dividends to our common shareholders as contemplated by our dividend policy 
at december   we had borrowings of million related to aircraft under our amended credit facility no 
during the second quarter of  we plan to refinance a majority of these aircraft  as well as additional aircraft that we expect to acquire during the first half of  with long term financing using a cost effective debt structure such as a non recourse securitization or similar bank market financing 
we believe that similar bank market financing would be available in a single  diversified portfolio transaction structured like a securitization or would also be available in a series of smaller financings 
we expect to extend  modify or replace the maturity of our revolving credit facility prior to its current maturity of june  and to modify or replace amended credit facility no 
with a similar aircraft acquisition facility prior to its current maturity of december  however  future deterioration in our performance or the markets could limit our ability to access these sources of financing and or increase our cost of capital  which may negatively impact our ability to raise additional funds  grow our business and to pay dividends to our common shareholders

operating activities provided net cash flow of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flow from operations is 
table of contents primarily generated from rents received pursuant to the lease agreements on our aircraft 
it is reduced by interest paid on our borrowings and by selling  general and administrative expenses 
the amount of rent we receive depends on various factors  including the size  age and composition of our aircraft portfolio 
our aircraft lease agreements generally provide for the periodic payment of a fixed amount of rent over the life of the lease 
however  the amount of rent we receive may vary due to several factors  including the credit worthiness of our lessees and the occurrence of delinquencies and defaults 
it is also affected by the extent to which aircraft are off lease and our ability to remarket aircraft that are nearing the end of their leases 
our success in re leasing aircraft is affected by market conditions for our aircraft and by general industry trends 
at december   and  all  and of our aircraft  respectively  were on lease or inducted into the freighter conver sion process 
cash flow provided by operations is also affected by the interest expense we pay on our credit facilities and by our decisions to hedge the risk of changing interest rates 
all of our debt is currently floating rate and varies with changes in libor 
to the extent interest rates increase  we may be liable for more interest payments to our lenders 
our practice has been to hedge the expected future interest payments on a portion of our floating rate liabilities by entering into derivative contracts 
however  we remain exposed to changes in interest rates to the extent we decide to remain unhedged and the degree to which our hedges are not perfectly correlated to the hedged future cash flows 
net cash flow used in investing activities totaled million  million and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the period to period increase reflects the increase in our acquisition of aviation assets during this time 
during the year ended december   we acquired aircraft  as compared with aircraft during the year ended december  and aircraft during the year ended december   resulting in our gross investment of billion for the acquisition and improvement of flight equipment  or billion net of accrued liabilities  compared with million  or million net of accrued liabilities  during the year ended december   and million  or million net of accrued liabilities  during the year ended december  we also invested nbs p  million in debt investments during the year ended december   as compared with million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we paid million in net aircraft purchase deposits and progress payments during the year ended december   compared with million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december  cash outflows from investing activities during the years ended december  and were partially offset by proceeds of million and million  respectively  from the sale of one aircraft in may and one aircraft in march that are reported as discontinued operations 
net cash flow from financing activities totaled million  million and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the period to period increase for as compared with and reflects the significant increase in financing the acquisition of aviation assets during these periods as discussed in investing activities above 
during  we raised million through equity offerings  received billion in proceeds from our second securitization and received net proceeds of million from our credit facilities for a combined total of billion of financings to invest in aviation assets 
on june   we closed our second portfolio securitization  which we refer to as securitization no 
the net proceeds from securitization no 
were used to repay amounts owed under amended credit facility no 
and to repay credit facility no 
in full in july the remainder of the proceeds was used for working capital purposes 
we repaid million of debt outstanding on credit facility no 
on march  when we sold one of the aircraft that had been financed under this facility 
the aircraft had been classified as held for sale for accounting purposes and results of operations related to the aircraft have been reported in discontinued operations 
net cash flow from financing activities for the year ended december  also reflects the receipt of million from repurchase agreements 
the cash flow is primarily related to the acquisition and financing of two debt investments on march  
table of contents in  the fortress funds committed to invest million of equity in aircastle 
of this amount  million was contributed in and the remaining million was invested in in  we borrowed a total of million on secured credit facilities and million on repurchase agreements 
during  we received cash from credit facilities and securitizations of million  net of repayments  to finance investments in aircraft  and we received cash from repurchase agreements of million  net of repayments  to finance the acquisition of debt investments 
the borrowings under our credit facilities were collateralized by leases on our aircraft  ownership interests in the subsidiaries that own the aircraft  cash on deposit in lockbox accounts and other assets held by the collateral agent and rights under the service provider agreement and certain other agreements

represents contractual payments on our office leases in stamford  connecticut  dublin  ireland and singapore 
at december   we had purchase agreements or binding letters of intent to acquire aircraft  comprised of eight from gaif and fifteen from airbus 
purchase agreements and binding letters of intent are subject to certain conditions to closing and there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied and these acquisitions consummated 
our hedging transactions that use derivative instruments and our securities repurchase transactions also involve counterparty credit risk 
the counterparties to our derivative arrangements and repurchase agreements are major financial institutions with high credit ratings 
as a result  we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against this risk and will ultimately realize an economic benefit from our hedging strategies or recover the full value of the securities underlying our repurchase agreements in the event of a default by a counterparty 
margin calls our repurchase agreements and interest rate derivative instruments are  in some cases  subject to margin calls based on the value of the underlying security and the level of interest rates 
margin calls resulting from decreases in the value of our debt instruments or mark to market losses on our derivative instruments due to decreasing interest rates could require that we post additional collateral 
management believes that we maintain adequate cash reserves and liquidity to meet any reasonably possible margin calls resulting from these risks  but can make no assurances that we will have adequate additional collateral under all potential scenarios 
at december   and 
table of contents december   we had margin deposits in the amount of million and million  respectively 
as of february   the aggregate fair value of our interest rate swaps and our interest rate forward contracts was a liability of million and we had pledged million in cash collateral required under certain of our interest rate swaps and our interest rate forward contracts 
capital expenditures we make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with improvements made to our aircraft 
these expenditures include the cost of major overhauls necessary to place an aircraft in service and modifications made at the request of lessees 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred a total of million  million and million  respectively  of capital expenditures related to the acquisition of aircraft 
as of december   the weighted average by net book value age of our aircraft was approximately years 
in general  the costs of operating an aircraft  including maintenance expenditures  increase with the age of the aircraft 
under our leases  the lessee is primarily responsible for maintaining the aircraft 
we may incur additional maintenance and modification costs in the future in the event we are required to remarket an aircraft or a lessee fails to meet its maintenance obligations under the lease agreement 
at december   we held million of maintenance reserves 
these maintenance reserves are paid by the lessee to provide for future maintenance events 
provided a lessee performs scheduled maintenance of the aircraft  we are required to reimburse the lessee for scheduled maintenance payments 
in certain cases  we are also required to make lessor contributions  in excess of amounts a lessee may have paid  tow ards the costs of maintenance events performed by or on behalf of the lessee 
actual maintenance payments by lessees in the future may be less than projected as a result of a number of factors  including defaults by the lessees 
maintenance reserves may not cover the entire amount of actual maintenance expenses incurred and  where these expenses are not otherwise covered by the lessees  there can be no assurance that our operational cash flow and maintenance reserves will be sufficient to fund maintenance requirements  particularly as our aircraft age 
see item a 
risk factors if lessees are unable to fund their maintenance requirements on our aircraft  our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt obligations or to pay dividends on our common shares could be adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  foreign currency risk and foreign operations at december   all of our leases are payable to us in us dollars 
however  we incur euro and singapore dollar denominated expenses in connection with our subsidiary in ireland and branch office in singapore 
as of december   of our employees were based in ireland and three employees were based in singapore 
for the year ended december   expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  such as payroll and office costs  aggregated approximately million in us dollar equivalents and represented approximately of total selling  general and administrative expenses 
our international operations are a significant component of our business strategy and permit us more effectively to source new aircraft  service the aircraft we own and maintain contact with our lessees 
therefore  it is likely that our international operations and our exposure to foreign currency risk will increase ov er time 
although we have not yet entered into foreign currency hedges because our exposure to date has not been significant  if our foreign currency exposure increases we may enter into hedging transactions in the future to mitigate this risk 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred insignificant net gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates 
these risks are highly sensitive to many factors  including 
table of contents us monetary and tax policies  us and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control 
we are exposed to changes in the level of interest rates and to changes in the relationship or spread between interest rates 
our primary interest rate exposures relate to our lease agreements  debt investments  floating rate debt obligations and interest rate derivative instruments 
our lease agreements typically require the payment of a fixed amount of rent during the term of the lease 
similarly  our debt investments are predominately collateralized by fixed rate aircraft leases  and provide for a fixed coupon interest rate 
however  our borrowing agreements generally require payments based on a variable interest rate index  such as libor 
therefore  increases in interest rates may reduce our net income by increasing the cost of our debt without any corresponding increase in rents or cash flow from our securities 
we are also exposed to loss  and to margin calls  on i our fixed pay interest rate swaps to the extent interest rates decrease below the contractual fixed rates of our swaps and ii our other interest rate derivate instruments 
changes in interest rates may also impact our net book value as our debt investments and derivatives are periodically marked to market through stockholders equity 
generally  as interest rates increase the value of our fixed rate debt investments decreases 
the magnitude of the decrease is a function of the difference between the coupon rate and the current market rate of interest  the average life of the securities and the face amount of the securities 
we are also exposed to loss on i our fixed pay interest rate swaps to the extent interest rates decrease below the contractual fixed rates of our swaps and ii our other derivative instruments 
in general  we would expect that over time  decreases in the value of our debt investments attributable to interest rate changes will be offset to some degree by increases in the value of our derivative instruments  and vice versa 
however  our policy is to hedge only a portion of the variable rate interest payme nts on our outstanding and or expected future debt obligations rather than hedge the amount of our investments  therefore  our assets remain partially un hedged 
furthermore  the relationship between spreads on debt investments and spreads on derivative instruments may vary from time to time  resulting in a net aggregate book value increase or decrease 
changes in the general level of interest rates also can affect our ability to acquire new investments and our ability to realize gains from the settlement of such assets 
hedging the objective of our hedging policy is to adopt a risk averse position with respect to changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we have entered into a number of interest rate swaps and interest rate forward contracts to hedge the current and expected future interest rate payments on our variable rate debt 
interest rate swaps are agreements in which a series of interest rate cash flows are exchanged with a third party over a prescribed period 
an interest rate forward contract is an agreement to make or receive a payment at the end of the period covered by the contract  with reference to a change in interest rates 
the notional amount on a swap or forward contract is not exchanged 
our swap transactions typically provide that we make fixed rate payments and receive floating rate payments to convert our floating rate borrowings to fixed rate obligations to better match the largely fixed rate cash flows from our investments in flight equipment and debt investments 
similarly  our interest rate forward contracts typically provide for us to receive payment if interest rates increase and make a payment if they decrease 
however  we can give no assurance that our net income will not be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates

in february  we terminated this interest rate swap and incurred related fees and interest charges of approximately million 
as of december   we had pledged million in cash collateral under our interest rate swaps and our interest rate forward contracts and is included in other assets on our consolidating balance sheet 
related party transactions prior to our initial public offering  substantially all of the ownership interests in aircastle were beneficially owned by our employees and funds managed by affiliates of fortress 
in  fortress committed to invest million of equity in aircastle  all of which was drawn as of december  on february   the fortress funds contributed an additional million in exchange for  of our common shares 
on july   we returned the million to the fortress funds in exchange for the cancellation of  of our common shares 
in conjunction with the follow on public offering of our common shares on october   certain fortress shareholders offered  secondary common shares in a public offering  including  common shares from the selling fortress shareholders pursuant to the underwriter s option to cover over allotments 
following this offering  funds managed by the fortress shareholders and certain officers of fortress investment group llc beneficially owned approximately of the company s common shares 
the company did not receive any funds from this secondary offering by the fortress shareholders 
during part of  our primary operations were managed by fortress 
fortress  acting as manager  incurred direct operating costs on our behalf 
these operating costs primarily included payroll costs  office supplies and professional fees paid to third parties 
these costs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   due to affiliate represented reimbursable expenditures of million paid by fortress in in  all amounts due to or from affiliates were settled by cash payment 
during a portion of  we occupied space in facilities leased by fortress and rent of thousand  determined based on actual costs to fortress  was reimbursed to fortress 

table of contents inflation inflation generally affects our costs  including sg a expenses and other expenses 
inflation also will increase the price of the airframes and engines we purchase under the airbus af agreement  although we have agreed with the manufacturers to certain limitations on price escalation in order to reduce our exposure to inflation 
our contractual commitments described elsewhere in this report include estimates we have made concerning the impact of inflation on our acquisition cost under the airbus af agreement 
we do not believe that our financial results have been  or will be  adversely affected by inflation in a material way 
management s use of ebitda we define ebitda as income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense  and depreciation and amortization 
we use ebitda to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance  and we believe this non gaap measure is helpful in identifying trends in our performance 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieving optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
ebitda provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
accordingly  this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
ebitda is one of the metrics used by senior management and the board of directors to review the consolidated financial performance of our business 
limitations of ebitda ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures of earnings 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our earnings to calculate ebitda  and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to gaap net income loss  include

depreciation and amortization  though not directly affecting our current cash position  represent the wear and tear and or reduction in value of our aircraft  which affects the aircraft s availability for use and may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures  and

the cash portion of income tax benefit provision generally represents charges gains  which may significantly affect our financial results 
an investor or potential investor may find this item important in evaluating our performance  results of operations and financial position 
we use non gaap financial measures to supplement our gaap results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
ebitda is not an alternative to net income  income from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of ebitda to gaap net income loss  along with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we also strongly urge you to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
in addition  because ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  the ebitda measure  as presented in this annual report  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the table below shows the reconciliation of net income loss to ebitda for the years ended december   and

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes through our securities portfolio  our variable rate liabilities and our interest rate swap and forward contracts 
increases in interest rates could decrease the fair value of our debt investments  increase the amount of interest payments on our variable rate debt and reduce the spread we earn between our generally fixed rate revenues and our variable rate interest expense 
we enter into interest rate swaps and forward contracts to minimize the risks associated with our variable rate debt 
decreases in interest rates would decrease the value of our interest rate hedging contracts  which may result in margin calls from our hedge counterparty pursuant to which we are required to pledge cash collateral to secure such a loss in value 
as of december   we had pledged million in cash collateral under our interest rate swaps and our interest rate forward contracts  as identified in the ta ble below  and a change in swap rates equal to one basis point will result in a change in the required cash collateral amount approximately equal to million 
as of february   the aggregate fair value of our interest rate swaps and our interest rate forward contracts was a liability of million and we had pledged million in cash collateral required under certain of our interest rate swaps and our interest rate forward contracts 
the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our debt investments and variable rate liabilities  the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity date and related weighted average interest rates as of the end of each period 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates as derived from appropriate spot rate observations as of the reporting date 
for interest rate swaps and forward contracts  the table presents notional amounts by expected maturity date and weighted average interest rates as of the end of each period
