item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we believe that we are the first company dedicated solely to developing the full spectrum of next generation access network solutions to cost effectively deliver high bandwidth services while simultaneously preserving the investment in today s networks 
our next generation solutions are based upon our single line multi service  or slms  architecture 
from its inception  this slms architecture was specifically designed for the delivery of multiple classes of subscriber services such as voice  data and video distribution  rather than being based on a particular protocol or media 
in other words  our slms products are built to support the migration from legacy circuit to packet technologies and from copper to fiber technologies 
this flexibility and versatility allows our products to adapt to future technologies while allowing service providers to focus on the delivery of additional high bandwidth services 
because this slms architecture is designed to interoperate with existing legacy equipment  service providers can leverage their existing networks to deliver a combination of voice  data and video services today  while they migrate  either simultaneously or at a future date  from legacy equipment to next generation equipment with minimal interruption 
we believe that our slms solution provides an evolutionary path for service providers from their existing infrastructures  as well as gives newer service providers the capability to deploy cost effective  multi service networks that can support voice  data and video 
our product offerings fall within two categories the slms product family and legacy  services  and other 
commencing with the first quarter of  we have reported our optical transport business with our legacy  services and other product category 
we have reclassified prior period balances in order to conform to the current period s presentation 
we sold our legacy imarc product line in december  our legacy access node product line in december and our legacy gigamux product line in january our global customer base includes regional  national and international telecommunications carriers  as well as cable service providers 
to date  our products are deployed by over network service providers on six continents worldwide 
we believe that we have assembled the employee base  technological breadth and market presence to provide a simple yet comprehensive set of next generation solutions to the bandwidth bottleneck in the access network and the other problems encountered by network service providers when delivering communications services to subscribers 
since inception  we have incurred significant operating losses and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  going forward  our key financial objectives include the following increasing revenue while continuing to carefully control costs  continued investments in strategic research and product development activities that will provide the maximum potential return on investment  and minimizing consumption of our cash and short term investments 
acquisitions since inception  we have utilized a strategy of acquisitions to acquire customers  technology and build scale within the network access markets 
as of december   we had completed twelve acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies to supplement our internal growth 
to date  we have generated a significant amount of our revenue from sales of products obtained through acquisitions 
some of the more significant acquisitions have included paradyne in september  sorrento networks corporation in july  and tellium inc in november 
table of contents if we complete additional acquisitions in the future  we could consume cash  incur substantial additional debt and other liabilities  incur amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets or incur large write offs related to impairment of goodwill and long lived assets 
in addition  future acquisitions may have a significant impact on our short term results of operations  materially impacting revenues or expenses and making period to period comparisons of our results of operations less meaningful 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because changes in such estimates can materially affect the amount of our reported net income or loss 
for all of these policies  management cautions that actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment of product under contractual terms which transfer title to customers upon shipment  under normal credit terms  net of estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of shipment 
revenue is deferred if there are significant post delivery obligations  if collection is not considered reasonably assured at the time of sale  or if the fees are not fixed or determinable 
when significant post delivery obligations exist  revenue is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled 
our arrangements generally do not have any significant post delivery obligations 
we offer products and services such as support  education and training  hardware upgrades and post warranty support 
for multiple element revenue arrangements  we establish the fair value of these products and services based primarily on sales prices when the products and services are sold separately 
if fair value cannot be established for undelivered elements  all of the revenue under the arrangement is deferred until those elements have been delivered 
when collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized when cash is collected 
revenue from education services and support services is recognized over the contract term or as the service is performed 
we make certain sales to product distributors 
these customers are given certain privileges to return a portion of inventory 
return privileges generally allow distributors to return inventory based on a percent of purchases made within a specific period of time 
we recognize revenue on sales to distributors that have contractual return rights when the products have been sold by the distributors  unless there is sufficient customer specific sales and sales returns history to support revenue recognition upon shipment 
in those instances when shipments made to distributors are recognized upon shipment of the products from the factory  we use historical rates of return from the distributors to provide for estimated product returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
we accrue for warranty costs  sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment based on historical experience and expected future costs 
allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts we record an allowance for sales returns for estimated future product returns related to current period product revenue 
the allowance for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue and an allowance against our accounts receivable 
we base our allowance for sales returns on periodic assessments of historical trends in product return rates and current approved returned products 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our future revenue could be adversely affected 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments for amounts owed to us 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
we base our allowance on periodic assessments of our customers liquidity and 
table of contents financial condition through analysis of information obtained from credit rating agencies  financial statement reviews and historical collection trends 
additional allowances may be required in the future if the liquidity or financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in impairment in their ability to make payments 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets our long lived assets have consisted primarily of goodwill  other acquisition related intangible assets and property and equipment 
we review goodwill for impairment in november of each year  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business  difficulty and delays in integrating an acquired business  a significant change in the operations of an acquired business  or significant negative economic trends  such as stock price movements 
the provisions of sfas require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we have determined that we operate in a single segment with one operating unit 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based on a combination of the market  income and replacement cost approaches 
in the application of the impairment testing  we are required to make estimates of future operating trends and resulting cash flows and judgments on discount rates and other variables 
actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
during and  we determined that indicators of impairment existed  resulting in an impairment charge to goodwill of million and million  respectively 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that forecasts used to support our goodwill may change in the future  which could result in additional non cash impairment charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
as of december   we had million of goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future net undiscounted cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
during and  we determined that indicators of impairment related to our intangible assets existed and an impairment analysis was performed  resulting in an impairment loss to amortizable intangible assets of million and million  respectively 
as a result of the impairment charges  our amortizable intangible assets at december  and december  were zero 
at december   our other long lived assets consisted of million of net property and equipment 
stock based compensation in the first quarter of  we adopted sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we adopted the modified prospective method of transition under which prior periods are not restated for comparative purposes 
we have estimated the 
table of contents fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model  which is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the expected stock price volatility is based on the weighted average of the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options and historical volatility of our peers where we lack our own historical information 
we base our expected life assumption on our historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards we grant to employees 
risk free interest rates reflect the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero 
if factors change  and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net loss and net loss per share 
we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
fair value stock based compensation expense under sfas r for the year ended december  includes compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the provisions of sfas r  we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation to expense from the accelerated method to the straight line method 
compensation expense for all employee share based payment awards granted on or prior to december  will continue to be recognized using the accelerated method while compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  is recognized using the straight line method 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we recognized compensation cost for stock options issued or assumed through acquisitions  based on the intrinsic value  which represents the difference between the exercise price of each stock option granted or assumed and the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the grant date or consummation date of the business combination 
the resulting deferred stock compensation was amortized over the vesting periods of the applicable options 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in addition  we have reclassified prior years stock based compensation expense to the associated operating expense line items in the consolidated statements of operations in order to conform to the current year presentation 
in addition  stock based compensation expense was recorded for options issued to non employees 
these options are generally immediately exercisable and expire seven to ten years from the date of grant 
we value non employee options using the black scholes model 
non employee options subject to vesting are valued as they become vested 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
in assessing the net realizable value of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with the current or committed inventory levels 
once inventory has been written down to its estimated net realizable value  its carrying value cannot be increased due to subsequent changes in demand forecasts 
to the extent that a severe decline in forecasted demand occurs  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may incur significant charges for excess inventory 

table of contents operating lease liabilities as a result of our acquisition of paradyne in september  we assumed certain lease liabilities for facilities in largo  florida 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination eitf  we accrued a liability for the excess portion of these facilities 
the computation of the estimated liability includes a number of assumptions and subjective variables 
these variables include the level and timing of future sublease income  amount of contractual variable costs  future market rental rates  discount rate  and other estimated expenses 
if circumstances change  and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the lease liability may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our net loss and net loss per share 
results of operations we list in the tables below the historical consolidated statement of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated

additionally  a reduction in customers capital expenditure spending contributed to the overall decrease in revenue 
product revenue accounted for the majority of the total decrease in revenue 
in  product revenue decreased or million and service revenue decreased or million compared to service revenue represents revenue from maintenance and other services associated with product shipments 
international revenue increased or million to million in and represented of total revenue compared with in the increase in international revenue represents the increasing opportunity for our next generation products in both existing and new network deployments among emerging international carriers in latin america 
while we have experienced growth in international markets  we continue to encounter price focused competitors and we anticipate this will continue as we pursue these markets 
by product family  revenue for our slms product family increased million or in compared to due to increased adoption of iptv  voip and broadband services  creating increased demand for our slms products  particularly in international territories 
revenue for our legacy products and services decreased million or in as compared to  supporting the growing shift from legacy technologies to our growing slms business 
additionally  we continue to divest non strategic legacy products in order to focus our efforts on our slms product family 
for example  during january  we sold our gigamux legacy product line  during the fourth quarter of  we sold our accessnode legacy product line  and in  we divested our imarc legacy product line 
the decrease in legacy product revenue was driven by the sale of the imarc product line at the end of and expected migration of legacy products to next generation solutions 
we anticipate that the product mix will continue to shift toward next generation products within the slms product family 

table of contents while no customer accounted for or more of net revenue in  or  we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period may depend to a large extent on sales to a small number of large accounts 
as a result  our revenue for any quarter may be subject to significant volatility based upon changes in orders from one or a small number of key customers 
cost of revenue and gross profit total cost of revenue  including stock based compensation  decreased million  or to million for  compared to million for total cost of revenue was of revenue for  compared to of revenue for the decrease in cost of revenue for compared to was primarily due to a significantly decreased obsolescence provision for legacy products 
as compared to  the provision for obsolescence decreased by million 
in addition  gains of million related to the sale of the access node and imarc product lines during further reduced cost of revenue as compared to the prior year 
finally  personnel related costs for decreased over by million due to the operating leverage on fixed manufacturing costs as a result of the consolidation of our manufacturing operations into one facility 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sell inventory and certain assets related to our imarc legacy product line to a third party 
the sale of the imarc product line was not treated as a discontinued operation since it did not represent a component of our company that had operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguishable  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
upon performance of certain obligations and delivery of assets in the first quarter of  we recognized a gain of million that was recorded in cost of revenue 
upon sale of the remaining imarc inventory during the second quarter of  we recognized an additional gain to cost of revenue of million related to the sale of the legacy imarc product line 
in december  we sold inventory and certain assets related to our access node legacy product line to a third party 
the sale of the access node product line was not treated as a discontinued operation since it did not represent a component of our company that had operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguishable  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
upon sale of the access node inventory  we recognized a gain of million that was recorded in cost of revenue 
additional gain may be recorded in the future contingent upon attainment of certain earnout provisions 
we expect that in the future  our cost of revenue will also vary as a percentage of net revenue depending on the mix and average selling prices of products sold in the future 
in addition  competitive and economic pressures could cause us to reduce our prices  adjust the carrying values of our inventory  or record inventory charges relating to discontinued products and excess or obsolete inventory 
research and product development expenses research and product development expenses decreased or million to million for compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to approximately million in non recurring specific new product development efforts expended during we intend to continue to invest in research and product development to attain our strategic product development objectives  while seeking to manage the associated costs through expense controls 
additionally  for the year ended december   approximately million of stock based compensation expense was included in research and product development expenses  compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the decline in stock price as well as reduced volatility rate assumptions  increased forfeitures  and the decline in interest rates

amortization of intangible assets there was no amortization of intangible assets for compared to million for because the intangible assets were fully amortized as of december  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill we review goodwill and other long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
during the third quarter of  we determined that indicators of impairment existed as we experienced an adverse change in our business as evidenced by a decline in our projected revenue due to technology transition issues with our largest international customers  and a resulting decline in our market capitalization 
we performed an impairment analysis which resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million as the fair value of our reporting unit was less than book value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
we also recorded a non cash impairment charge for other intangible assets of million  which represented the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible assets exceeded the fair value 
no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets was recorded in interest expense interest expense for decreased by million to million compared to due primarily to a decrease in the outstanding debt balances

income tax provision during the years ended december  and  we recorded an income tax provision of million and million  respectively  related to foreign and state taxes 
no material provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded  due to our recurring operating losses and the significant uncertainty regarding the realization of our net deferred tax assets  against which we have continued to record a full valuation allowance

cash management our primary source of liquidity comes from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  which totaled million at december   and our million revolving line of credit and letter of credit facility  and an accounts receivable purchase facility with silicon valley bank  or the svb facilities 
our short term investments are classified as available for sale and consist of securities that are readily convertible to cash  including certificates of deposits  commercial paper and government securities  with original maturities at the date of acquisition ranging from days to one year 
at current revenue levels  we anticipate that some portion of our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will continue to be consumed by operations 
under the svb facilities  we have the option of borrowing funds at agreed upon rates of interest  so long as the aggregate amount of outstanding borrowings does not exceed million 
in addition  we may sell specific accounts receivables to silicon valley bank  on a non recourse basis  at agreed upon discounts to the face amount of those accounts receivables  so long as the aggregate amount of outstanding accounts receivables does not exceed million 
the svb facilities are renewed on an annual basis  and are currently scheduled to expire in march there can be no assurance that silicon valley bank will agree to any future renewal of the svb facilities 
under these facilities  million was outstanding at december   and an additional million was committed as security for various letters of credit

as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
future requirements and funding sources our fixed commitments for cash expenditures consist primarily of payments under operating leases  inventory purchase commitments  and payments of principal and interest for debt obligations

the term of the lease expires in june and had an estimated remaining obligation of approximately million as of december  we intend to continue to occupy only a portion of these facilities and are evaluating our options to exit the excess portion of the lease 
we have recorded a liability of million as of december  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination eitf  which we believe is adequate to cover costs incurred to exit the excess portion of these facilities 
as a result of the financial demands of major network deployments and the difficulty in accessing capital markets  network service providers continue to request financing assistance from their suppliers 
from time to time  we may provide or commit to extend credit or credit support to our customers 
this financing may include extending credit to customers 
depending upon market conditions  we may seek to factor these arrangements to financial institutions and investors to reduce the amount of our financial commitments associated with such arrangements 
for example  during the year ended december   we sold million of customer trade receivables to financial institutions on a non recourse basis in exchange for cash 
the sale of the receivables did not represent a securitization  and there was no continuing involvement or interests in the receivables by us after the sale 
our ability to provide customer financing is limited and depends upon a number of factors  including our capital structure  the level of our available credit and our ability to factor commitments to third parties 
any extension of financing to our customers will limit the capital that we have available for other uses 
as of december   we did not have any significant customer financing commitments 
in march  we filed a form s registration statement which allows us to sell  from time to time  up to million of our common stock or other securities 
although we may use this multi purpose shelf registration to raise additional capital  there can be no certainty as to when or if we may offer any securities under the shelf registration or what the terms of any such offering would be 
our accounts receivable  while not considered a primary source of liquidity  represents a concentration of credit risk because a significant portion of the accounts receivable balance at any point in time typically consists of a relatively small number of customer account balances 
as of december   no customers accounted for more than of accounts receivable  and receivables from customers in territories outside of the united states of america represented of accounts receivable 
we do not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures  or any other material commitments aside from operating leases for our facilities  inventory purchase commitments and debt 
we expect that operating losses and negative cash flows from operations will continue for at least the next year 
based on our current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and available credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
for example  we generated additional cash through the sale of our gigamux legacy product line during january however  we may require additional funds if our revenues or expenses fail to meet our current projections or to support other purposes and we may need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurances that additional funding 
table of contents will be available at all  or that if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
if we were to raise funds through the issuance of debt securities or other debt financing  the terms of such debt may include covenants  restrictions and financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital or are required to obtain additional capital on terms that are not favorable to us  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts 
contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements at december   our estimated future contractual commitments by fiscal year were as follows in thousands total and beyond operating leases line of credit debt inventory purchase commitments total operating leases the operating lease amounts shown above represent primarily off balance sheet arrangements 
for operating lease commitments  a liability is generally not recorded on our balance sheet unless the facility represents an excess facility for which an estimate of the facility exit costs has been recorded on our balance sheet 
for operating leases that include contractual commitments for operating expenses and maintenance  estimates of such amounts are included based on current rates 
payments made under operating leases will be treated as rent expense for the facilities currently being utilized 
of the total million operating lease amount  million has been recorded as a liability on our balance sheet as of december  line of credit and debt the debt and line of credit obligations have been recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet 
the debt obligation amounts shown above represent the scheduled principal repayments  but not the associated interest payments which may vary based on changes in market interest rates 
at december   the interest rate on our outstanding debt obligations ranged from to 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our line of credit and an additional million committed as security for various letters of credit  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
inventory purchase commitments inventory purchase commitments represent the amount of excess inventory purchase commitments that have been recorded as a liability on our balance sheet at december  recent accounting pronouncements sfas fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash  cash equivalents and investments we consider all cash and highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments consisted of the following as of december  and in thousands december  december  cash and cash equivalents short term investment concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments consist principally of demand deposit and money market accounts  commercial paper and corporate debentures and bonds with credit ratings of aa or better 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are principally held with various domestic financial institutions with high credit standing 
as of december  and  receivables from customers in international territories represented and  respectively  of accounts receivable 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not hold financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are not subject to material interest rate risk due to their short maturities 
under our investment policy  short term investments have a maximum maturity of one year from the date of acquisition  and the average maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed six months 
due to the relatively short maturity of the portfolio  a increase in market interest rates at december  would decrease the fair value of the portfolio by less than million 
as of december   our outstanding long term debt balance was million 
interest on our long term debt accrues on the unpaid principal balance at a variable interest rate which adjusts every six months equal to the sum of the libor rate plus per annum  provided that in no event will the variable interest rate a exceed per annum  b be less than per annum  or c be adjusted by more than at any adjustment date 
assuming the outstanding balance on our variable rate long term debt remains constant over a year  a increase in the interest rate would decrease pre tax income and cash flow by approximately million 
foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
substantially all of our assets are located in the united states 
we have sales operations throughout europe  asia  the middle east and latin america 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily inter company receivables and payables 
accordingly  our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies 
during and  we did not hedge any of our foreign currency exposure 
during and  we recorded a million foreign exchange loss and a million foreign exchange gain  respectively  in other income expense on our statements of operations 
we have performed sensitivity analyses as of december  and  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of million and million at december  and  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift in foreign currency exchange rates  which do not always move in the same direction 
actual results may differ materially
