the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties  real estate depreciation and amortization  and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities  including minority interests  which are convertible into common shares 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and excluding depreciation  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies

we consider portions of this report to be forward looking within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  both as amended  with respect to our expectations for future periods 
forward looking statements do not discuss historical fact  but instead include statements related to expectations  projections  intentions or other items relating to the future 
although we believe the expectations reflected in our forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  we can give no assurance our expectations will be achieved 
any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact should be deemed forward looking statements

factors that may cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from those contemplated by forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following insufficient cash flows could affect our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders and create refinancing risk  unfavorable changes in economic conditions could adversely impact occupancy or rental rates  we have significant debt  which could have important adverse consequences  volatility in debt markets could adversely impact future acquisitions and values of real estate assets  various changes could adversely impact the market price of our common shares  development and construction risks could impact our profitability  our property acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected  difficulties of selling real estate could limit our flexibility  variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk  issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition  losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage  potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs  tax matters  including failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit could have adverse consequences  investments through joint ventures and partnerships involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor  we face risks associated with investment in and management of a discretionary fund  our dependence on our key personnel  we may incur losses on interest rate hedging arrangements  competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income  and changes in laws and litigation risks could affect our business 
these forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions as of the date of this report 
executive summary based on our results for the year ended december  and the projected economic conditions  we expect moderating growth during economic factors affecting our revenue include declining job growth and continued population growth and household formations in the markets in which we operate  as well as declining fundamentals in the for sale single family housing market 
negative sentiment currently surrounding single family housing could have a positive impact on multifamily demand  as more potential home buyers choose to rent and existing renters extend their stays in apartment homes 
however  high inventories of unsold single family homes in select markets could cause further declines in home prices  making home buying a more attractive option for some renters or resulting in additional single family homes becoming rental units 

table of contents we intend to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities through our investment in and management of a discretionary investment fund 
during its term  which will end eight years from the final closing  subject to two one year extensions  the fund will be our exclusive investment vehicle for acquiring fully developed multifamily properties  subject to certain exceptions 
we expect market concentration risk to be mitigated as our property operations are not centralized in any one market and our portfolio of apartment communities are geographically diverse 
we also intend to continue focusing on our development pipeline with approximately billion to billion in our current and future development pipelines 
total projected capital costs and the commencement of future developments may be impacted by increasing construction costs and other factors 
property portfolio our multifamily property portfolio  excluding land held for future development and joint venture properties which we do not manage  is summarized as follows december  december  apartment apartment homes properties homes properties operating properties las vegas  nevada dallas  texas houston  texas tampa  florida washington  dc metro charlotte  north carolina orlando  florida atlanta  georgia austin  texas raleigh  north carolina denver  colorado southeast florida phoenix  arizona los angeles orange county  california san diego inland empire  california other total operating properties properties under development washington  dc metro houston  texas austin  texas los angeles orange county  california orlando  florida san diego inland empire  california total properties under development total properties less joint venture properties las vegas  nevada houston  texas phoenix  arizona los angeles orange county  california washington  dc metro dallas  texas denver  colorado other total joint venture properties total properties owned effective january   the operations of two adjacent properties were combined

the increase in average rental rates was a result of moderate improvements in fundamentals resulting from continued job growth  population growth  and household formations 
average occupancy at our same store properties declined less than in  as we saw decreases in occupancy in a majority of our markets

see further discussion of gains associated with property dispositions in property portfolio 
the impairment loss on land for the year ended december  of million coincided with our decision to abandon development efforts at a site located in dallas  texas 
prior to our decision to abandon efforts  the carrying value of the land was supportable with cash flow projections from expected development 
while no determination has been made to dispose of the asset  we have written down previously recorded carrying costs to record the asset at fair market value

income tax expense is comprised of million in margin taxes  million in federal income taxes on our taxable reit subsidiaries  and million in state taxes in our operating partnerships 
funds from operations ffo management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties  real estate depreciation and amortization  and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities  including minority interests  which are convertible into common shares 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and excluding depreciation  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 

table of contents we believe in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and data included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is not defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance 
additionally  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 
reconciliations of net income to diluted ffo for the years ended december   and are as follows in thousands funds from operations net income gain on sale of properties  net of tax real estate depreciation and amortization income allocated to convertible minority interests adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures funds from operations diluted weighted average shares basic incremental shares assumable from assumed conversion of common share options and awards granted common units weighted average shares diluted including amounts for discontinued operations

adjustment is net of million in prepayment penalties incurred with the repayment of mortgage notes directly associated with the sold properties 
liquidity and capital resources we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and preserving our financial flexibility  which we believe enhances our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available 
we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and common and preferred equity  extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where possible  managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt  borrowing on an unsecured basis in order to maintain a substantial number of unencumbered assets  and maintaining conservative coverage ratios 
our interest expense coverage ratio  net of capitalized interest  was  and times for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our interest expense coverage ratio is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of income from continuing operations before gain on sale of properties  equity in income of joint ventures and minority interests  depreciation  amortization  interest expense and income from discontinued operations 
at december   and   and  respectively  of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered

table of contents as a result of the significant cash flow generated by our operations  the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other short term borrowings  proceeds from dispositions of properties and other investments and access to the capital markets by issuing securities under our automatic shelf registration statement  we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash flow needs during including normal recurring operating expenses  current debt service requirements  recurring capital expenditures  repurchase of common equity securities  initial funding of property developments  acquisitions and notes receivable  and the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of one of our principal long term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt  including borrowings under our unsecured line of credit used to fund development and acquisition activities

in january  our board of trust managers approved the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common equity securities

the scheduled interest rate spreads are subject to change as our credit ratings change 
advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates  or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates 
these bid rate loans have terms of six months or less and may not exceed the lesser of million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit 
the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations  all of which we are in compliance 

table of contents our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to million in letters of credit 
while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line  it does reduce the amount available 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million  and had million available under our unsecured line of credit 
as an alternative to our unsecured line of credit  we from time to time borrow using competitively bid unsecured short term notes with lenders who may or may not be a part of the unsecured line of credit bank group

the interest payments on certain secured notes with floating interest rates and our line of credit were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of december  contingent on timing of capital calls by the fund  subject to change 

table of contents the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured  third party debt 
we are not committed to any additional funding on third party debt in relation to our joint ventures 
we are committed to funding an additional million under mezzanine loans provided to joint ventures 
we have guaranteed the repayment of the construction loans of five of our development joint ventures in an amount equal to our percentage interest in such joint ventures  totaling million 
we believe it is unlikely significant payments will be required under these guarantees 
see further discussion of our investments in various joint ventures in note  investments in joint ventures in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from to months 
in an inflationary environment  we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases 
the short term nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse affects of inflation 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those most important to the presentation of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we follow financial accounting and reporting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
principles of consolidation 
our consolidated financial statements include our assets  liabilities and operations and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries and partnerships 
we also make co investments with unrelated third parties and determine whether to consolidate or use the equity method of accounting for these ventures 
fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities as revised and emerging issues task force no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights are two of the primary sources of accounting guidance in this area 
in accordance with this accounting literature  we will consolidate joint ventures determined to be variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
we will also consolidate any joint ventures that are not determined to be variable interest entities but where we exercise control over major operating decisions through substantive participating rights 
any entities that do not meet the criteria for consolidation  but where we exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
income recognition 
our rental and other property income is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned 
other property income consists primarily of utility rebillings  and administrative  application and other transactional fees charged to our residents 
our apartment homes are rented to residents on lease terms generally ranging from to months  with monthly payments due in advance 
interest  fee and asset management and all other sources of income are recognized as earned 
two of our properties are subject to rent control or rent stabilization 
operations of apartment properties acquired are recorded from the date of acquisition in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
in management s opinion  due to the number of residents  the type and diversity of submarkets in which the properties operate  and the collection terms  there is no significant concentration of credit risk 
cost capitalization 
real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges 
carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development 
expenditures directly related to the development  acquisition and improvement of real estate assets  excluding internal costs relating to acquisitions of operating properties  are capitalized at cost as land  buildings and improvements 
indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized 
all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported on the balance sheet in properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed 
upon substantial completion of the apartment homes  the total cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land  respectively  and the assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method of depreciation 
where possible  we stage our construction to allow leasing and occupancy during the construction period  which we believe minimizes the duration of the lease up period following completion of construction 
our accounting policy related to properties in the development and leasing phase is all operating expenses associated with completed apartment homes are expensed 

table of contents as discussed above  carrying charges are principally interest and real estate taxes capitalized as part of properties under development and buildings and improvements 
capitalized interest was million in  million in and million in capitalized real estate taxes were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we capitalize renovation and improvement costs we believe extend the economic lives 
capital expenditures subsequent to initial construction are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
depreciation and amortization is computed over the expected useful lives of depreciable property on a straight line basis with lives generally as follows estimated useful life buildings and improvements years furniture  fixtures  equipment and other years intangible assets in place leases and above and below market leases average lease term allocations of purchase price 
upon the acquisition of real estate  we allocate the purchase price between tangible and intangible assets  which includes land  buildings  furniture and fixtures  the value of in place leases  including above and below market leases  and acquired liabilities 
when allocating the purchase price to acquired properties  we allocated costs to the estimated intangible value of in place leases and above or below market leases and to the estimated fair value of furniture and fixtures  land and buildings on a value determined by assuming the property was vacant by applying methods similar to those used by independent appraisers of income producing property 
depreciation and amortization is computed on a straight line basis over the remaining useful lives of the related assets 
the value of in place leases and above or below market leases is amortized over the estimated average remaining life of leases in place at the time of acquisition 
estimates of fair value of acquired debt are based upon interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 
asset impairment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment exists if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets 
generally  when impairment exists the long lived asset is adjusted to its respective fair value 
we consider projected future undiscounted cash flows  trends  and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist 
while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such factors as market rents  economies  and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates 
in determining fair value  management uses appraisals  management estimates  or discounted cash flow calculations 
we recorded impairment charges on land of million and million for the years ended december  and our impairment charge in coincided with our decision to abandon development efforts at a site located in dallas  texas 
prior to our decision to abandon development efforts  the carrying value of the land was supportable with cash flow projections from expected development 
derivative instruments 
we utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and we designate the financial instruments as cash flow hedges under the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 accounting for certain instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of statement no 
 and sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these statements require every derivative instrument to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value  with changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for cash flow hedge relationships  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument deemed effective at offsetting the risk being hedged are reported in other comprehensive income 
for cash flow hedges where the cumulative changes in the fair value of the derivative exceed the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedged item  the ineffective portion is recognized in current period earnings 
all derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet and measured at fair value 
derivatives not qualifying for hedge treatment must be recorded at fair value with gains or losses recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we enter into derivative financial instruments from time to time  but do not use them for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate swap agreements are used to reduce the potential impact of changes in interest rates on variable rate debt 

table of contents we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
this process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction  the nature of the risk being hedged  and how the hedging instrument s effectiveness in hedging the exposure to the hedged transaction s variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk will be assessed and measured 
both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  we assess whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items 
we discontinue hedge accounting if a derivative is not determined to be highly effective as a hedge or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge 
as of december   we had million in variable rate debt subject to cash flow hedges 
see note  derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments 
accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated statements of stockholders equity  reflects the effective portions of cumulative changes in the fair value of derivatives in qualifying cash flow hedge relationships 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin prescribes a two step process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the first step involves evaluation of a tax position to determine whether it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step involves measuring the benefit to recognize in the financial statements for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
we adopted fin as of january  if various tax positions related to certain real estate dispositions were not sustained upon examination  we would have been required to pay a deficiency dividend and associated interest for prior years 
accordingly  we decreased distributions in excess of net income as of january  for the adoption impact of fin by approximately million 
our period of uncertainty with respect to these real estate dispositions expired during fiscal year  and we recorded a net credit to interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  the tax years ended december    and remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of december  we believe we have no uncertain tax positions or unrecognized tax benefits requiring disclosure 
we may from time to time be assessed interest or penalties by major tax jurisdictions  although any such assessments historically have been minimal and immaterial to our financial results 
in the event we receive an assessment for interest and or penalties  it will be classified in the financial statements as tax expense 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement does not require new fair value measurements  but is applied to the extent other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements 
the statement emphasizes fair value as a market based measurement which should be determined based on assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
we will be required to disclose the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the inputs used to develop the measurements  and the effect of certain of the measurements on earnings or changes in net assets for the period 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we have adopted sfas no 
effective january  for financial assets and financial liabilities and do not expect this adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position but will enhance the level of disclosures for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis ie  the fair value option  which are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards 
the election to use the fair value option is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment 
subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
additionally  sfas no 
allows for a one time election for existing positions upon adoption  with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have adopted this standard effective january  and have elected not to measure any of our current eligible financial assets or liabilities at fair value upon adoption  however  we do reserve the right to elect to measure future eligible financial assets or liabilities at fair value 
in september  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for the sale of real estate subject to the requirements of fasb statement no

r  business combinations  which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations  which  among other things  establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer entity recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed including intangibles and any noncontrolling interests in the acquired entity 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we are currently evaluating what impact our adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  and december  december  weighted weighted average weighted average weighted maturity average maturity average amount in years interest of amount in years interest of in millions rate total in millions rate total fixed rate debt variable rate debt excludes balances outstanding under our unsecured line of credit  which are included in variable rate debt 
includes million term loan which has become effectively fixed by the use of an interest rate swap see discussion below 
we use variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline 
to the extent we incur additional variable rate indebtedness  our exposure to increases in interest rates would increase 
we believe such increases in interest expense as a result of inflation would not significantly impact our distributable cash flow 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common shareholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common shareholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 

table of contents holding other variables constant  a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the net income available to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt  excluding debt effectively fixed by interest rate swap described below  would be approximately million  holding all other variables constant 
we currently use interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable indebtedness  not for trading or speculative purposes 
under swap agreements we agree to pay a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate  and the counterparty agrees to pay us the interest rate that would have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular market index 
as of december   the effect of our swap agreement was to fix the interest rate on million of our variable rate debt 
had the swap agreement not been in place during  our annual interest costs would have been approximately million higher  based on balances and reported interest rates through the year 
additionally  if the variable interest rates on this debt had been basis points higher through and this swap agreement not been in place  our annual interest cost would have been approximately million higher 
because the counterparty providing the swap agreements is a major financial institution which has an aa or better credit rating by the standard poor s ratings group  we have no reason to believe there is exposure at this time to a default by the counterparty provider
