risk factors an investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent to our business 
the material risks and uncertainties that our management believes affect us are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report  including the pending litigation discussed in this report  which provides a description of our current material litigation claims and assessments 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that our management is not aware of or that they currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our securities  including our common stock  could decline significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
intense competition exists in the gaming industry  and we expect competition to continue to intensify 
the gaming industry is highly competitive for both customers and employees  including those at the management level 
we compete with numerous casinos and casino hotels of varying quality and size in market areas where our properties are located 
we also compete with other non gaming resorts and vacation areas  and with various other casino and other entertainment businesses  and could compete with any new forms of gaming that may be legalized in the future 
the casino entertainment business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably in their size  quality of facilities  number of operations  brand identities  marketing and growth strategies  financial strength and capabilities  level of amenities  management talent and geographic diversity 
in most markets  we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas 
in some markets  we face competition from nearby markets in addition to direct competition within our market areas 

table of contents in recent years  with fewer new markets opening for development  competition in existing markets has intensified 
we have invested in expanding existing facilities  such as blue chip  developing new facilities  such as echelon  and acquiring established facilities in existing markets  such as our acquisition of coast casinos  inc in july in addition  our competitors have also invested in expanding their existing facilities and developing new facilities 
this expansion of existing casino entertainment properties  the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we compete  and this intense competition can be expected to continue 
for example  a smaller hotel casino located directly across from sam s town las vegas is currently being redeveloped 
this enhanced facility is expected to open in the third quarter of and may have an adverse impact on the results of operations at sam s town las vegas 
if our competitors operate more successfully than we do  if they are more successful than us in attracting and retaining employees  if their properties are enhanced or expanded  or if additional hotels and casinos are established in and around the locations in which we conduct business  we may lose market share or the ability to attract or retain employees 
in particular  the expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on native american tribal lands 
expansion of native american gaming in areas located near our properties  or in areas in or near those from which we draw our customers  could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
the pokagon band of potawatomi indians  a federally recognized native american tribe  commenced operations of the four winds casino in new buffalo  michigan which is located approximately fifteen miles from blue chip in august although we have expanded our facility at blue chip in an effort to be more competitive in this market  the four winds casino has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on the operations of blue chip 
our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects may face significant risks inherent in construction projects or implementing a new marketing strategy  including receipt of necessary government approvals 
we regularly evaluate expansion  development  investment and renovation opportunities 
on january   we announced our planned las vegas strip development  echelon  which will be the largest and most expensive development project we have undertaken to date 
in addition  we have announced a new hotel expansion project at blue chip and that borgata has recently completed a public space expansion and is constructing a new hotel 
we also closed our acquisition of dania jai alai in march these projects and any other development projects we may undertake will be subject to the many risks inherent in the expansion or renovation of an existing enterprise or construction of a new enterprise  including unanticipated design  construction  regulatory  environmental and operating problems and lack of demand for our projects 
our current and future projects could also experience unanticipated delays and significant cost increases  shortages of materials  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  poor performance or non performance by any of our joint venture partners or other third parties on whom we are relying  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental  permitting  construction or geological problems  and weather interference  floods  fires or other casualty losses 

table of contents our anticipated costs and construction periods for projects are based upon budgets  conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects and contractors 
many of these costs are estimated at inception of the project and can change over time as the project is built to completion 
for example  we announced that the estimated cost of the wholly owned portion of echelon increased from billion to billion  principally as a result of additional scope  larger guest rooms and suites  and increased estimated construction costs  and that the estimated development costs associated with the properties that will be developed and constructed in connection with our joint venture with morgans increased from million to million 
additional cost increases may continue to occur as we develop echelon 
the cost of any project may vary significantly from initial budget expectations  and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns 
if we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis  the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate funding is available 
the completion dates of any of our projects could also differ significantly from expectations for construction related or other reasons 
we cannot assure you that any project will be completed on time  if at all  or within established budgets  or that any project will result in increased earnings to us 
significant delays  cost overruns  or failures of our projects to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  our projects may not help us compete with new or increased competition in our markets 
certain permits  licenses and approvals necessary for some of our current or anticipated projects have not yet been obtained 
the scope of the approvals required for expansion  development  investment or renovation projects can be extensive and may include gaming approvals  state and local land use permits and building and zoning permits 
unexpected changes or concessions required by local  state or federal regulatory authorities could involve significant additional costs and delay the scheduled openings of the facilities 
we may not obtain the necessary permits  licenses and approvals within the anticipated time frames  or at all 
in addition  although we design our projects to minimize disruption of our existing business operations  expansion and renovation projects require  from time to time all or portions of affected existing operations to be closed or disrupted 
for example  in november we closed the stardust and demolished the property in march to make way for the development of echelon 
any significant disruption in operations of a property could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks associated with growth and acquisitions 
as part of our business strategy  we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets  through acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing gaming facilities 
for example  in february we completed the barbary coast exchange transaction 
in addition  in march we completed the acquisition of dania jai alai  and have previously announced an expansion project at blue chip and our echelon development project 
we may also pursue expansion opportunities  including joint ventures  in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming 
the expansion of our operations  whether through acquisitions  development or internal growth  could divert management s attention and could also cause us to incur substantial costs  including legal  professional and consulting fees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify  acquire  develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing operations without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses for our new projects or that gaming will be approved in jurisdictions where it is not currently approved 
ballot measures or other voter approved initiatives to allow gaming in jurisdictions where gaming  or certain types of gaming such as slots  was not previously permitted could be challenged  and  if such challenges are successful  these ballot measures or initiatives could be invalidated 
for example  in october  a group of plaintiffs brought suit in the circuit court in leon county  florida  against a group of defendants  including the 
table of contents florida secretary of state among others  seeking to permanently enjoin a proposed ballot measure to amend the florida constitution to allow florida voters to approve slot machines at certain pari mutuel gaming facilities in miami dade and broward counties the slot initiative 
the plaintiffs alleged that petition gatherers committed fraud in obtaining signatures to get the slot initiative placed on the ballot 
prior to the issuance of a final order by the circuit court  the slot initiative was approved by voters in november in january  the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants  citing among other reasons  that the slot initiative had been approved by voters 
the plaintiffs appealed this decision  and on august   a three judge panel of the first district court of appeals in broward county  florida  reversed the circuit court decision and ordered that the case be brought to trial 
in its decision  the panel indicated that in the event that the trial court determines that the petition did not have sufficient signatures to place the slot initiative on the ballot due to fraud  the trial court should invalidate the slot initiative 
on august   the defendants filed a motion seeking a rehearing by the three judge panel  or alternatively  to have the first district court of appeals rehear the case en banc or to have the case certified to the florida supreme court for rehearing 
on november   the first district court of appeals  in an en banc decision  essentially reaffirmed the panel s decision  but certified two questions to the florida supreme court whether validations of signatures by supervisors of elections can be challenged based upon allegations of fraud after certifications of signatures have been accepted by the secretary of state and the ballot printed and absentee voting commenced in accord with florida law  and whether an amendment to the florida constitution that is approved by vote of the electors may be subsequently invalidated if  in an action filed before the election  there is a showing made after the election that necessary signatures on the petition proposing the amendment were fraudulently obtained 
on march   the florida supreme court accepted jurisdiction to hear the certified questions  but subsequently reconsidered that decision  declined jurisdiction over the matter and remanded it to the circuit court for a trial on the merits 
if the slot initiative is invalidated  we would not be permitted to operate slot machines at the dania jai alai facility  which would materially affect any potential revenue and cash flow expected from the dania jai alai facility 
in february  our management determined to postpone redevelopment of the dania jai alai facility 
if we are unable to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects as well as other capital expenditures through cash flow  borrowings under our bank credit facility and additional financings  our expansion  development  investment and renovation efforts will be jeopardized 
we intend to finance our current and future expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  as well as our other capital expenditures  primarily with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our bank credit facility and equity or debt financings 
if we are unable to finance our current or future expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  or our other capital expenditures  we will have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing  delaying or abandoning planned expansion  development  investment and renovation projects as well as other capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  reducing the amount or discontinuing the distribution of dividends  obtaining additional equity financing or joint venture partners  or modifying our bank credit facility 
these sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  and other financing may not be available on acceptable terms  in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  our existing indebtedness contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
if we are unable to secure additional financing  we could be forced to limit or suspend expansion  development  investment and renovation projects and other capital expenditures  which may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  there have recently been significant disruptions in the global capital markets that have adversely impacted the ability of borrowers to access capital 
we anticipate that these disruptions may continue for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that we will be able to fund our currently planned expansion projects  including our blue chip expansion project  our wholly owned portion of the echelon project  and our share of our equity contributions to the high street retail promenade joint venture at echelon  using cash flows from operations and availability under our bank credit facility to the extent availability exists after we meet our working capital needs 
if availability under our bank credit facility does not exist  any additional financing that is needed may not be available to us  or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
as a result  if we are 
table of contents unable to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner or at all  we may be forced to sell assets in order to raise capital for the project  limit the scope of the project  defer the project or cancel the project altogether 
with respect to our joint venture with morgans to develop  construct and operate the delano las vegas and the mondrian las vegas hotels at echelon  given the current state of the credit markets  we anticipate that additional equity and or credit support will be necessary to obtain construction financing for the remaining cost of the project 
this additional equity and or credit support may be contributed by us or morgans  or from both parties  and or from one or more additional equity sponsors 
if the joint venture obtains equity financing from additional sponsors  then our percentage interest in the project and resulting cash flows will be diluted 
if the joint venture is unable to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner or at all  we may be forced to sell assets in order to raise capital for the project  limit the scope of the project  defer the project or cancel the project altogether 
should we postpone or cancel this project  we expect to continue the construction of the remaining aspects of our echelon development project  however  our expected returns from the echelon development project would be adversely impacted due to the change in the scope of the overall project 
if we are not ultimately successful in dismissing the action filed against our treasure chest casino property  we may potentially lose our ability to operate the treasure chest casino property and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
alvin c 
copeland  the sole shareholder of an unsuccessful applicant for a riverboat license at the location of our treasure chest casino  has made several attempts to have the treasure chest license revoked and awarded to his company 
in and  copeland unsuccessfully opposed the renewal of the treasure chest license and has brought two separate legal actions against us 
in november  copeland objected to the relocation of treasure chest from the mississippi river to its current site on lake pontchartrain 
the predecessor to the louisiana gaming control board allowed the relocation over copeland s objection 
copeland then filed an appeal of the agency s decision with the nineteenth judicial district court 
through a number of amendments to the appeal  copeland improperly attempted to transform the appeal into a direct action suit and sought the revocation of the treasure chest license 
treasure chest intervened in the matter in order to protect its interests 
the appeal suit  as it related to treasure chest  was dismissed by the district court and that dismissal was upheld on appeal by the first circuit court of appeal 
additionally  in  copeland filed a direct action against treasure chest and certain other parties seeking the revocation of treasure chest s license  an award of the license to him and monetary damages 
the suit was dismissed by the trial court citing that copeland failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted 
the dismissal was appealed by copeland to the first circuit court of appeal 
on june   the first circuit court of appeal reversed the trial court s decision and remanded the matter to the trial court 
on january   we filed a motion to dismiss the matter and that motion was partially denied 
the court of appeal refused to reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss 
in may  we filed additional motions to dismiss on other grounds 
there was no activity regarding this matter during and  and the case was set to be dismissed by the court for failure to prosecute by the plaintiffs in mid may  however on may   the plaintiff filed a motion to set a hearing date related to the motions to dismiss 
the hearing was scheduled for september   at which time all parties agreed to postpone the hearing indefinitely 
we currently are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
if this matter ultimately results in the treasure chest license being revoked  it could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive governmental gaming regulation and taxation policies  which may harm our business 
we are subject to a variety of regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
regulatory authorities at the federal  state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke  suspend  condition or limit our gaming or other licenses  impose substantial fines and take other actions  any one of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a more detailed description of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is included in exhibit  governmental gaming regulations filed with this annual report on form k and incorporated herein by reference 

table of contents if additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate  such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us 
from time to time  various proposals are introduced in the legislatures of some of the jurisdictions in which we have existing or planned operations that  if enacted  could adversely affect the tax  regulatory  operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and our company 
legislation of this type may be enacted in the future 
for example  on january   the new jersey state legislature enacted the smoke free air act that became effective april  this law called for smoke free environments in essentially all indoor workplaces and places open to the public  including places of business and service related activities 
the law contains several exemptions  including an exemption for all casino floor space and of a hotel s designated hotel rooms 
on february   atlantic city promulgated a local ordinance that is more restrictive than the aforementioned state law 
specifically  this ordinance reduced the casino floor exemption to of a casino s floor space 
as such  smoking is prohibited on of a casino s floor space and permitted on of a casino s floor space  subject to the following conditions commencing on april   casinos were required to limit smoking to of their casino floor space  which areas initially were not required to be enclosed and separately ventilated 
ultimately  the of the casino floor in which smoking will be permissible will be required to be enclosed and separately ventilated 
casinos had until september  to submit construction plans for such enclosures to applicable authorities for the issuance of building permits and related required approvals 
once permits are issued  the casinos will have days to commence construction of the enclosures 
borgata submitted its construction plans to the applicable authorities and is waiting on the required approvals 
under the atlantic city ordinance  smoking will remain permissible in of a hotel s designated hotel rooms  consistent with state law 
this legislation  and the local ordinance  could materially impact borgata s operations and comparable legislation in other jurisdictions in which we operate could materially impact our other properties 
in addition  the state of illinois enacted a smoking ban in all casinos effective january  the federal government has also previously considered a federal tax on casino revenues and may consider such a tax in the future 
in addition  gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes  and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time 
for example  in november  nevada s largest teachers union  the nevada state educational association  submitted a petition to the nevada secretary of state s office seeking to increase the gross gaming revenue tax from to 
if this petition is successful  it could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
in june  the illinois legislature passed certain amendments to the riverboat gambling act  which affected the tax rate at par a dice 
the legislation  which imposes an incremental tax on adjusted gross gaming revenues  was retroactive to july  as a result of this legislation  we were required to pay additional taxes  resulting in a million tax assessment in june if there is any material increase in state and local taxes and fees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
also  in may  blue chip received a valuation notice indicating an unanticipated increase of nearly to its assessed property value as of january  at that time  we estimated that the increase in assessed property value could result in a property tax assessment ranging between million and million for the eighteen month period ended june  we recorded an additional charge of million during the three months ended june  to increase our property tax liability to million at june  as we believed that was the most likely amount to be assessed within the range 
we subsequently received a property tax bill related to our tax assessment for million in december as we have appealed the assessment  indiana statutes allow for a minimum required payment of million  which was paid against the million assessment in january we believe the assessment for the twenty four month period ended december  could result in a property tax assessment ranging between million and million 
we have accrued approximately million of property tax liability as of december   based on what we believe to be the most likely assessment within our range  once all appeals have been exhausted  however  we can 
table of contents provide no assurances that the estimated amount will approximate the actual amount 
the final assessment  post appeals  as well as the march  assessment notice which is not expected until the second quarter of  could result in further adjustment to our estimated property tax liability at blue chip 
our directors  officers and other key employees must also be approved by certain state regulatory authorities 
if state regulatory authorities were to find a person occupying any such position unsuitable  we would be required to sever our relationship with that person 
certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions by us also require the approval of some state regulatory authorities 
in addition to gaming regulations  we are also subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting businesses in general 
these laws and regulations include  but are not limited to  restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages  environmental matters  employees  currency transactions  taxation  zoning and building codes  and marketing and advertising 
such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future  or new laws and regulations could be enacted 
for example  on july   new jersey gaming properties  including borgata  were required to temporarily close their casinos for three days as a result of a new jersey statewide government shutdown that affected certain new jersey state employees required to be at casinos when they are open for business 
in addition  nevada recently enacted legislation that eliminated in most instances  and  for certain pre existing development projects such as echelon  otherwise reduced  property tax breaks and retroactively eliminated certain sales tax exemptions offered as incentives to companies developing projects that meet certain environmental green standards 
as a result  we  along with other companies developing projects that meet such standards  may not realize the full tax benefits that were originally anticipated 
we own facilities that are located in areas that experience extreme weather conditions 
we own facilities that are located in areas that experience extreme weather conditions  including  but not limited to  hurricanes 
extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations  damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas 
for example  our treasure chest casino  which is located near new orleans  louisiana  suffered minor damage and was closed for days in as a result of hurricane katrina 
additionally  our delta downs racetrack casino hotel  which is located in southwest louisiana  suffered significant property damage and closed for days in as a result of hurricane rita 
while we maintain insurance that may cover some of the costs we incur as a result of some extreme weather conditions  our coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect  if at all  on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions 
if any of our properties are damaged or if their operations are disrupted as a result of extreme weather in the future  or if extreme weather adversely impacts general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which they draw their patrons  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our facilities  including our riverboats and dockside facilities  are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure and regulatory compliance 
generally  all of our facilities are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time  as the result of casualty  forces of nature  mechanical failure  or extended or extraordinary maintenance  among other causes 
in addition  our gaming operations  including those conducted on riverboats or at dockside facilities could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions 
we currently conduct our treasure chest  par a dice  blue chip and sam s town shreveport gaming operations on riverboats 
each of our riverboats must comply with us coast guard requirements as to boat design  on board facilities  equipment  personnel and safety 
each riverboat must hold a certificate of inspection for stabilization and flotation  and may also be subject to local zoning codes 
the us coast guard requirements establish design standards  set limits on the operation of the vessels and require individual licensing of all 
table of contents personnel involved with the operation of the vessels 
loss of a vessel s certificate of inspection or american bureau of shipping approval would preclude its use as a casino 
us coast guard regulations require a hull inspection for all riverboats at five year intervals 
under certain circumstances  alternative hull inspections may be approved 
the us coast guard may require that such hull inspections be conducted at a dry docking facility  and if so required  the cost of travel to and from such docking facility  as well as the time required for inspections of the affected riverboats  could be significant 
to date  the us coast guard has allowed in place inspections of our riverboats 
the us coast guard might not allow these types of inspections in the future 
the loss of a dockside casino or riverboat casino from service for any period of time could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
us coast guard regulations also require us to prepare and follow certain security programs 
in  we implemented the american gaming association s alternative security program at our riverboat casinos and dockside facilities 
the american gaming association s alternative security program is specifically designed to address maritime security requirements at riverboat casinos and their respective dockside facilities 
changes to these regulations could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we draw a significant percentage of our customers from limited geographic regions 
events adversely impacting the economy or these regions  including man made or natural disasters  may also impact our business 
our california hotel and casino  fremont hotel and casino and main street station casino  brewery and hotel draw a substantial portion of their customers from the hawaiian market 
for the year ended december   patrons from hawaii comprised approximately of the room nights sold at the california  at the fremont and at main street station 
an increase in fuel costs or transportation prices  a decrease in airplane seat availability  or a deterioration of relations with tour and travel agents  particularly as they affect travel between the hawaiian market and our facilities  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our las vegas properties also draw a substantial number of customers from certain other specific geographic areas  including southern california  arizona and las vegas 
native american casinos in california and other parts of the united states have diverted some potential visitors away from nevada  which has had and could continue to have a negative effect on nevada gaming markets 
in addition  due to our significant concentration of properties in nevada  any man made or natural disasters in or around nevada  or the areas from which we draw customers for our las vegas properties  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
each of our properties located outside of nevada depends primarily on visitors from their respective surrounding regions and are subject to comparable risk 
the outbreak of public health threats at any of our properties or in the areas in which they are located  or the perception that such threats exist  as well as adverse economic conditions that affect the national or regional economies  whether resulting from war  terrorist activities or other geopolitical conflict  weather  general or localized economic downturns or related events or other factors  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  to the extent that the airline industry is negatively impacted due to the outbreak of war  public health threats  terrorist or similar activity  increased security restrictions or the public s general reluctance to travel by air  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected 
energy price increases may adversely affect our cost of operations and our revenues 
our casino properties use significant amounts of electricity  natural gas and other forms of energy 
in addition  our hawaiian air charter operation uses a significant amount of jet fuel 
while no shortages of energy or fuel have been experienced to date  substantial increases in energy and fuel prices  including jet fuel prices  in the 
table of contents united states have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our operating results 
the extent of the impact is subject to the magnitude and duration of the energy and fuel price increases  which impact could be material 
in addition  energy and gasoline price increases in areas that constitute a significant source of customers for our properties could result in a decline in disposable income of potential customers  an increase in the cost of travel and a corresponding decrease in visitation and spending at our properties  which could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our stockholders own large interests in our capital stock and may significantly influence our affairs 
william s 
boyd  our executive chairman  together with his immediate family  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock as of december  as a result  the boyd family has the ability to significantly influence our affairs  including the electing of our directors and  except as otherwise provided by law  approving or disapproving other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders  including a merger  consolidation or sale of assets 
some of our hotel casinos are located on leased property 
if we default on one or more leases  the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected hotel casino 
we lease certain parcels of land on which the orleans  suncoast  sam s town tunica  treasure chest and sam s town shreveport are located 
in addition  we lease other parcels of land on which portions of the california and the fremont are located 
if we were to default on any one or more of these leases  the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land  including the hotel casinos 
this would have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
we had total consolidated long term debt  net of current maturities  of approximately billion at december  we expect that our long term indebtedness will substantially increase in connection with the capital expenditures we anticipate making as a result of our planned expansion  development  investment and renovation projects 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a significant adverse effect on us 
the interest rates on a portion of our long term debt are subject to fluctuation based upon changes in short term interest rates and  as a result  our interest expense could increase 

table of contents our current debt service requirements on our bank credit facility primarily consist of interest payments on outstanding indebtedness 
the bank credit facility consists of a billion revolving credit facility that matures in may subject to certain limitations  we may at any time  without the consent of the lenders under our bank credit facility  request incremental commitments to increase the size of the revolving credit facility  or request new commitments to add a term loan facility  by up to an aggregate amount of billion 
debt service requirements under our current outstanding senior subordinated notes consist of semi annual interest payments based upon fixed annual interest rates ranging from to and repayment of the million  million and million of principal on december   april   and february   respectively 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness  and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
it is unlikely that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our bank credit facility  in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as it matures and to fund our other liquidity needs 
we believe that we will need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness at or prior to each maturity  however  we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners 
these financing strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  certain states laws contain restrictions on the ability of companies engaged in the gaming business to undertake certain financing transactions 
some restrictions may prevent us from obtaining necessary capital 
our common stock price may fluctuate substantially  and your investment could decline in value 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could fluctuate substantially due to many factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations  announcements of significant acquisitions or other agreements by us or by our competitors  our sale of common stock or other securities in the future  the trading volume of our common stock  conditions and trends in the gaming and destination entertainment industries  changes in the estimation of the future size and growth of our markets  and general economic conditions  including  among other things  changes in the cost of fuel and air travel 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to companies operating performance 
broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  shareholder derivative lawsuits securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources

item legal proceedings copeland 
alvin c 
copeland  the sole shareholder of an unsuccessful applicant for a riverboat license at the location of our treasure chest casino  has made several attempts to have the treasure chest license revoked and awarded to his company 
in and  copeland unsuccessfully opposed the renewal of the treasure chest license and has brought two separate legal actions against us 
in november  copeland objected to the relocation of treasure chest from the mississippi river to its current site on lake pontchartrain 
the predecessor to the louisiana gaming control board allowed the relocation over copeland s objection 
copeland then filed an appeal of the agency s decision with the nineteenth judicial district court 
through a number of amendments to the appeal  copeland unsuccessfully attempted to transform the appeal into a direct action suit and sought the revocation of the treasure chest license 
treasure chest intervened in the matter in order to protect its interests 
the appeal suit  as it related to treasure chest  was dismissed by the district court and that dismissal was upheld on appeal by the first circuit court of appeal 
additionally  in  copeland filed a direct action against treasure chest and certain other parties seeking the revocation of treasure chest s license  an award of the license to him and monetary damages 
the suit was dismissed by the trial court citing that copeland failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted 
the dismissal was appealed by copeland to the louisiana first circuit court of appeal 
on june   the first circuit court of appeal reversed the trial court s decision and remanded the matter to the trial court 
on january   we filed a motion to dismiss the matter and that motion was partially denied 
the court of appeals refused to reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss 
in may  we filed additional motions to dismiss on other grounds 
there was no activity regarding this matter during and  and the case was set to be dismissed by the court for failure to prosecute by the plaintiffs in mid may  however on may   the plaintiff filed a motion to set a hearing date related to the motions to dismiss 
the hearing was scheduled for september   at which time all parties agreed to postpone the hearing indefinitely 
we currently are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
if this matter ultimately results in the treasure chest license being revoked  it could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are also parties to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that  except for the copeland matter discussed previously  all pending claims  if adversely decided  would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations

table of contents due to the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita on two of our properties  treasure chest and delta downs  we recorded million of net hurricane and related expenses in other operating items asset impairment due to a prior history of operating losses at sam s town tunica  in prior reporting periods  we tested the assets of sam s town tunica for recoverability pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the asset recoverability test required the estimation of sam s town tunica s undiscounted future cash flows and comparing that aggregate total to the property s carrying value 
sam s town tunica s financial performance improved during and its profitability is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
in  the property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows exceeded its carrying value  therefore  we do not believe sam s town tunica s assets to be impaired and we did not perform an impairment test of its long lived assets  however  we will continue to monitor the performance of sam s town tunica and  if necessary  continue to update our asset recoverability test under sfas no 
if future asset recoverability tests indicate that the assets of sam s town tunica are impaired  we will be subject to a non cash write down of its assets  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
we have significant amounts of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment test of these assets in the second quarter of each year  which resulted in no impairment charge for the years end december   and  however  if our ongoing estimates of projected cash flows related to these assets are not met  we may be subject to a non cash write down of these assets in the future  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
dania jai alai on march   we acquired dania jai alai and approximately acres of related land located in dania beach  florida 
dania jai alai is one of four pari mutuel facilities in broward county approved under florida law to operate  class iii slot machines see note  commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information related to the broward county slot initiative and the pending challenge to its validity 
we purchased dania jai alai with the intention of redeveloping the property into a slot based casino 
we paid approximately million to close this transaction  and  if certain conditions are satisfied  we will be required to pay an additional million  plus interest accrued at the prime rate the contingent payment  in march or earlier 
in february  management completed its analysis of our opportunity to operate slot machines at dania jai alai and decided to postpone redevelopment of the facility due to the following considerations the continued poor performance of the broward county pari mutuel casinos  the introduction of class iii slot machines and the probable pending addition of table games at a nearby native american casino  the prohibitively high gaming tax rate for pari mutuel slot operators  the pending introduction of casino gaming in miami dade county and the introduction of legislation to allow for slot machines at all pari mutuel facilities in the state of florida 
as circumstances change  management will monitor our opportunities with respect to dania jai alai 
due to the change in circumstances  during the first quarter of  we will test dania jai alai s long lived and intangible assets  as well as any goodwill that may arise from the finalization of our purchase price allocation  for impairment 
although we cannot quantify an amount at this time  we expect this impairment test to result in the write down of a portion of these assets 
in addition  we may be subject to another impairment charge if and when the contingent payment is resolved and added to the cost of the acquisition

we review our goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if our ongoing estimates of projected cash flows at blue chip are not met due to the negative impact of increased competition or otherwise  we may be subject to a non cash write down of these assets  which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations

we do not expect to make further capital contributions to borgata for this project 
on september   the water club sustained a fire that caused approximately million in property damage  based on current estimates 
borgata carries insurance policies that its management believes will cover most of the replacement costs related to the property damage  with the exception of minor amounts principally related to insurance deductibles and certain other limitations 
during  borgata incurred million of expenses related to the fire 
although the fire damage will delay its opening  borgata currently believes the water club will be able to open in june  however  no assurances can be made that it will open by that time  that insurance will cover the total replacement cost of the property damage  or that the costs related to the property damage will not increase above current estimates 
in addition  borgata has delay in completion insurance coverage for the water club for certain costs totaling up to million  subject to various limitations and deductibles  which borgata believes may help to offset some of the costs related to the postponement of its opening 
in addition  borgata maintains business interruption insurance that covers certain lost profits  however  borgata has not pursued a possible claim at this time 
as such  borgata s insurance carrier has yet to confirm or deny coverage

borgata has significant uses for its cash flows  including maintenance and expansion capital expenditures  interest payments  state income taxes and the repayment of debt 
borgata s cash flows are primarily used for its business needs and are not generally available except to the extent distributions are paid to us to service our indebtedness 
as of december  and  we had balances of cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively

on a daily basis  we evaluate our cash position and adjust the revolver balance as necessary by either paying it down with excess cash or borrowing under the revolver 
we also plan the timing and the amounts of our capital expenditures 
we believe that our revolving bank credit facility and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and maintenance capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
the source of funds for our development projects  such as blue chip s new hotel project and our echelon development project  is expected to come primarily from cash flows from operations and availability under our bank credit facility  to the extent availability exists after we meet our working capital needs 
we could also seek to fund these projects in whole or in part through incremental bank financing and additional debt or equity offerings 
if availability does not exist under our bank credit facility  additional financing may not be available to us  or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us

other items affecting liquidity development projects echelon 
in january  we announced plans to develop echelon on the las vegas strip and commenced construction in june  with a planned opening in the third quarter we estimate that the wholly owned components of echelon will cost approximately billion 
in addition  we have completed the design 
table of contents and development work on two joint venture elements of echelon  which include our hotel joint venture with morgans hotel group llc morgans  and our high street retail promenade joint venture with general growth properties ggp 
we expect that echelon will include a total of approximately  rooms in five unique hotels as well as the following amenities casino space  square feet entertainment venues  seat and  seat theaters  operated by aeg live high street retail promenade  square feet  operated by ggp meeting and convention space  square feet parking approximately  spaces echelon will also include approximately dining  nightlife and beverage venues in addition to an approximately acre multi level swimming pool and recreation deck 
on february   we exchanged the barbary coast for acres on the las vegas strip  bringing our total land holdings to contiguous acres on the echelon site 
the additional land allowed us to modify the site layout of echelon and increase the overall size of the project to acres  and provides us with two additional parcels of six and acres that could allow for the addition of another distinct hotel  a residential component  and additional retail  dining  meeting and casino space 
in connection with our joint venture with morgans to develop  construct and operate the delano las vegas and the mondrian las vegas hotels at echelon  we will contribute approximately acres of land and morgans will ultimately contribute million to the venture 
the expected cost of the project  including the land  is estimated to be approximately million  however  we can provide no assurances that the estimated cost will approximate the actual cost 
construction on the delano and mondrian hotels is expected to begin in the second quarter of given the current state of the credit markets  we anticipate that additional equity and or credit support will be necessary to obtain construction financing for the remaining cost of the project 
this additional equity and or credit support may be contributed by us or morgans  or from both parties  and or from one or more additional equity sponsors 
if the joint venture is unable to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner or at all  we may be forced to sell assets in order to raise capital for the project  limit the scope of the project  defer the project or cancel the project altogether 
should we postpone or cancel this project  we expect to continue the construction of the remaining aspects of our echelon development project  however  our expected returns from the echelon development project would be adversely impacted due to the change in the scope of the overall project 
in may  we formed our joint venture with ggp  whereby we will initially contribute the above ground real estate air rights and ggp will initially contribute million to develop the high street retail promenade at echelon 
the expected cost of this project  including the air rights  is estimated to be approximately million  however  we can provide no assurances that the estimated cost will approximate the actual cost 
we expect that the joint venture will be equity funded 
we anticipate that any additional cash outlay from us will come from cash flows from operations and availability under our bank credit facility  to the extent availability exists after we meet our working capital needs 
if availability under our bank credit facility does not exist  additional financing may not be available to us  or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
blue chip 
in october  we announced a million expansion project at blue chip to add a second hotel with approximately guest rooms  a spa and fitness center  additional meeting and event space  as well as more dining and nightlife venues 
we began construction on the project in march and it is expected to open in december 
table of contents dania jai alai 
on march   we acquired dania jai alai and approximately acres of related land located in dania beach  florida 
dania jai alai is one of four pari mutuel facilities in broward county approved under florida law to operate  class iii slot machines see note  commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information related to the broward county slot initiative and the pending challenge to its validity 
we purchased dania jai alai with the intention of redeveloping the property into a slot based casino 
we paid approximately million to close this transaction and  if certain conditions are satisfied  we will be required to pay an additional million  plus interest accrued at the prime rate the contingent payment  in march or earlier 
we can provide no assurances as to when  or whether  such conditions will be satisfied 
we will not record a liability for the contingent payment unless or until the contingency has been resolved and the additional consideration is distributable 
if the contingency is resolved and the contingent payment is made  it will be added to the cost of the acquisition 
in february  management completed its analysis of our opportunity to operate slot machines at dania jai alai and decided to postpone redevelopment of the facility due to the following considerations the continued poor performance of the broward county pari mutuel casinos  the introduction of class iii slot machines and the probable pending addition of table games at a nearby native american casino  the prohibitively high gaming tax rate for pari mutuel slot operators  the pending introduction of casino gaming in miami dade county and the introduction of legislation to allow for slot machines at all pari mutuel facilities in the state of florida 
as circumstances change  management will monitor our opportunities with respect to dania jai alai 
due to the change in circumstances  during the first quarter of  we will test dania jai alai s long lived and intangible assets  as well as any goodwill that may arise from the finalization of our purchase price allocation  for impairment 
although we cannot quantify an amount at this time  we expect this impairment test to result in the write down of a portion of these assets 
in addition  we may be subject to another impairment charge if and when the contingent payment is resolved and added to the cost of the acquisition 
pennsylvania land 
on september  the effective date  we entered into an agreement to sell approximately acres of land that we own in pennsylvania for million  before selling costs  contingent upon certain conditions 
as of the date of this filing  the sale has not closed  however  the closing date of the sale must occur no later than fifteen months after the effective date 
we expect to use the net proceeds from the sale of the land to reduce our outstanding balance under our revolving bank credit facility 
the closing of this transaction is subject to various conditions  therefore  we can provide no assurances that the transaction will close on time  if at all 
we can provide no assurances that our expansion and development projects will be completed within our current estimates  commence operations as expected  include all of the anticipated amenities  features or facilities  or achieve market acceptance 
in addition  our development projects are subject to those additional risks inherent in the development and operation of a new or expanded business enterprise  including potential unanticipated operating problems 
also see part i  item a 
risk factors our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects may face significant risks inherent in construction projects or implementing a new marketing strategy  including receipt of necessary government approvals 
if our expansion  development  investment or renovation projects do not become operational within the time frame and project costs currently contemplated or do not successfully compete in their markets  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
once our projects become operational  they will face many of the same risks that our current properties face including  but not limited to  increases in taxes due to changes in legislation 
recently  there have been significant disruptions in the global capital markets that have adversely impacted the ability of borrowers to access capital 
we anticipate that these disruptions may continue for the foreseeable future 
despite these disruptions  we anticipate that we will be able to fund our currently planned expansion projects  including our blue chip expansion project  our wholly owned portion of the echelon project  and our share of our equity contribution to the high street retail promenade joint venture  using cash flows from operations and availability under our bank credit facility  to the extent availability exists after we meet our 
table of contents working capital needs 
any additional financing that is needed may not be available to us  or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
other opportunities we regularly investigate and pursue additional expansion opportunities in markets where casino gaming is currently permitted 
we also pursue expansion opportunities in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming 
such expansions will be affected and determined by several key factors  including outcome of gaming license selection processes  approval of gaming in jurisdictions where we have been active but where casino gaming is not currently permitted  identification of additional suitable investment opportunities in current gaming jurisdictions  and availability of acceptable financing 
additional projects may require us to make substantial investments or may cause us to incur substantial costs related to the investigation and pursuit of such opportunities  which investments and costs we may fund through cash flow from operations or availability under our bank credit facility 
to the extent such sources of funds are not sufficient  we may also seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us

critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies may require a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we evaluate our goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets in accordance with the applications of sfas no 
related to goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
related to impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for goodwill and intangible assets  we review the carrying values on an annual basis and between annual dates in certain circumstances 
for assets to be disposed of we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal  as estimated based on comparable asset sales  solicited offers  or a discounted cash flow model 
for assets to be held and used  we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 

table of contents inherent in the reviews of the carrying amounts of the above assets are various estimates 
first  management must determine the usage of the asset 
to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold or disposed of  it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized 
assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
this means that some assets must be grouped  and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets 
future cash flow estimates are  by their nature  subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
if our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods 
our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory  social and economic climates  recent operating information and budgets of the various properties where we conduct operations 
these estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal  state or local regulations  economic downturns  or other events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties 
in february  management completed its analysis of our opportunity to operate slot machines at dania jai alai and decided to postpone redevelopment of the facility due to the following considerations the continued poor performance of the broward county pari mutuel casinos  the introduction of class iii slot machines and the probable pending addition of table games at a nearby native american casino  the prohibitively high gaming tax rate for pari mutuel slot operators  the pending introduction of casino gaming in miami dade county and the introduction of legislation to allow for slot machines at all pari mutuel facilities in the state of florida 
as circumstances change  management will monitor our opportunities with respect to dania jai alai 
due to the change in circumstances  during the first quarter of  we will test dania jai alai s long lived and intangible assets  as well as any goodwill that may arise from the finalization of our purchase price allocation  for impairment 
although we cannot quantify an amount at this time  we expect this impairment test to result in the write down of a portion of these assets 
in addition  we may be subject to another impairment charge if and when the contingent payment is resolved and added to the cost of the acquisition 
due to a prior history of operating losses at sam s town tunica  in prior reporting periods  we tested the assets of sam s town tunica for recoverability pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the asset recoverability test required the estimation of sam s town tunica s undiscounted future cash flows and comparing that aggregate total to the property s carrying value 
sam s town tunica s financial performance improved during and its profitability is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
in  the property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows exceeded its carrying value  therefore  we do not believe sam s town tunica s assets to be impaired and we did not perform an impairment test of its long lived assets  however  we will continue to monitor the performance of sam s town tunica and  if necessary  continue to update our asset recoverability test under sfas no 
if future asset recoverability tests indicate that the assets of sam s town tunica are impaired  we will be subject to a non cash write down of its assets  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
on july   we entered into a unit purchase agreement  as amended  the agreement to sell south coast to michael j 
gaughan for a total purchase price of approximately million 
in connection with entering into the agreement  we met all of the criteria required to classify certain of the assets and liabilities of south coast as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets 
as such  we ceased depreciation of those assets and they were measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
this resulted in an estimated non cash  pretax impairment charge of million in september  as the fair value of the assets were less than their carrying value at that time 
we recorded a million non cash charge related to the write off of the net book value of the original blue chip gaming vessel in june  which was replaced with a new gaming vessel in conjunction with our expansion project 
after analysis of alternative uses for the original vessel  management decided in june to permanently retire the asset from further operations 
we recorded a million asset write down during the year ended december  related to land held for sale in pennsylvania that we previously planned to utilize as a site for a gaming operation 
in september  we withdrew our application for gaming approval  which led to our decision to sell the land 

table of contents we determined that the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita was a triggering event requiring impairment tests for treasure chest and delta downs assets during our impairment tests were based upon estimated future cash flows from these properties 
based upon the results of the tests  no impairment was indicated for any of the assets tested 
because we intend to redevelop the land on which stardust is located and our plans included the demolition of stardust s existing buildings and abandoning other related assets  we performed an impairment test for this property 
based upon the results of this test  we recorded a million non cash impairment loss in to write down the long lived assets of the stardust to their estimated fair value 
capital expenditures and depreciation 
we must also make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense is highly dependent upon the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 
in connection with the closure and demolition of stardust  we reevaluated the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets residing on the land associated with our echelon development project  including our corporate office building  and recorded million of accelerated depreciation expense in capitalized interest 
we capitalize interest costs associated with major construction projects as part of the cost of the constructed assets 
when no debt is incurred specifically for a project  interest is capitalized on amounts expended for the project using our weighted average cost of borrowing 
capitalization of interest ceases when the project or discernible portions of the project is substantially complete 
we amortize capitalized interest over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
derivative instruments 
we utilize an investment policy for managing risks associated with our current and anticipated future borrowings  such as interest rate risk and its potential impact on our fixed and variable rate debt 
under this policy  we may utilize derivative contracts that effectively convert our borrowings from either floating rate to fixed or fixed rate to floating 
the policy does not allow for the use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
to the extent we employ such financial instruments pursuant to this policy  and the instruments qualify for hedge accounting  we may designate and account for them as hedged instruments 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the underlying hedged item must expose us to risks associated with market fluctuations and the financial instrument used must be designated as a hedge and must reduce our exposure to market fluctuations throughout the hedged period 
if these criteria are not met  a change in the market value of the financial instrument is recognized as a gain or loss in the period of change 
otherwise  gains and losses are not recognized except to the extent that the hedged debt is disposed of prior to maturity or to the extent that acceptable ranges of ineffectiveness exist in the hedge 
net interest paid or received pursuant to the financial instrument is included in interest expense in the period 
we measure the fair value of our interest rate hedges via a discounted cash flow analysis of the projected future receipts or payments based upon the forward yield curve on the date of measurement 
share based employee compensation 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method and as such  results for prior periods have not been restated 
this statement requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
this cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
under the modified prospective method  we expense the cost of share based compensation awards issued after january  additionally  we recognize compensation cost for the portion of awards outstanding on january  for which the requisite service has not been rendered over the period the requisite service is being rendered after january  compensation costs related to stock option awards are calculated based on the fair value of each major option grant on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model that requires the formation of assumptions to be used in the model  such as expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  
table of contents expected option lives and dividend yields 
we formed our assumptions using historical experience and observable conditions 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and several states in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based upon the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcome of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
to determine necessary reserves  we must make assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  partially based on past experiences 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes relating to uncertain tax matters 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates or when potential actions are settled differently than we expected  we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the current period 
self insurance reserves 
we are self insured up to certain stop loss amounts for employee health coverage  workers compensation and general liability costs 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported 
in estimating these accruals  we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
we believe our estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon our methodology  however  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors could materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
litigation  claims and assessments 
we also utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments related to our business and tax matters 
these estimates are based upon our knowledge and experience about past and current events and also upon reasonable assumptions about future events 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk  specifically long term us treasury rates and the applicable spreads in the high yield investment market and short term and long term libor rates  and its potential impact on our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under our bank credit facility 
borrowings under our bank credit facility are based upon  at our option  the libor rate or the base rate  plus an applicable margin in either case 
the applicable margin is a percentage per annum which ranges from to if we elect to use the libor rate  and to if we elect to use the base rate determined in accordance with a specified pricing grid based upon our predefined total leverage ratio 
we also attempt to manage the impact of interest rate risk on our long term debt by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
for more information  see note  derivative instruments in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   we utilized interest rate swap agreements 
interest differentials resulting from these agreements are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense 
interest rate swaps related to debt are matched to specific debt obligations 

table of contents we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december   however  we believe that this risk is minimized because we monitor the credit ratings of the counterparties to the swaps 
if we had terminated our swaps as of december   we would have been required to pay million based on the fair values of the derivative instruments 
the following table provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest swaps and debt obligations 
for our debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for our interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by the expected contractual maturity dates 
the notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts 
the weighted average variable rates are based upon prevailing interest rates
