item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which are included in this report  and the risk factors information  set forth in item a above 
overview over the past years  quiksilver has been established as a global company representing the casual  youth lifestyle associated with boardriding sports 
we began operations in as a california company making boardshorts for surfers in the united states under a license agreement with the quiksilver brand founders in australia 
our product offering expanded in the s as we grew our distribution channels 
after going public in and purchasing the rights to the quiksilver brand in the united states from our australian licensor  we further expanded our product offerings and began to diversify 
in  we acquired the european licensee of quiksilver and introduced roxy  our surf brand for teenage girls 
we also expanded demographically in the s by adding products for boys  girls  toddlers and men  and we introduced our proprietary retail store concepts  which display the heritage and products of quiksilver and roxy 
in  we acquired the international quiksilver and roxy trademarks  and in  we acquired our licensees in australia and japan 
in  we acquired dc shoes  inc to expand our presence in action sports inspired footwear 
in  we acquired rossignol  a wintersports and golf equipment company 
today our products are sold throughout the world  primarily in surf shops  skate shops  snow shops and specialty stores 
in october  we entered into an agreement to sell our golf equipment business 
this transaction was completed in december for a transaction value of million 
as a result of this disposition  the following financial information has been adjusted to exclude our golf equipment business 
the golf 
table of contents equipment business has also been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
in august  we entered into an agreement to sell our rossignol business  including the related brands of rossignol  dynastar  look and lange for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
this transaction was completed in november beginning with our fiscal quarter ended april   we classified our rossignol business  including both wintersports equipment and apparel  as discontinued operations for all periods presented under sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the rossignol business assets and related liabilities are classified as held for sale  and the operations are classified as discontinued in our consolidated financial statements  for all periods presented 
we expect to incur a pre tax loss on the sale of rossignol of approximately million  partially offset by an expected tax benefit of approximately million during the three months ending january  as a result of this disposition  the following financial information has been adjusted to exclude our wintersports equipment business 
over the last five years  our revenues from continuing operations have grown from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal we operate in the outdoor market of the sporting goods industry in which we design  produce and distribute branded apparel  footwear  accessories and related products 
we operate in three segments  the americas  europe and asia pacific 
the americas segment includes revenues primarily from the us and canada 
the european segment includes revenues primarily from western europe 
the asia pacific segment includes revenues primarily from australia  japan  new zealand and indonesia 
royalties earned from various licensees in other international territories are categorized in corporate operations along with revenues from sourcing services for our licensees 
revenues by segment from continuing operations are as follows year ended october  in thousands americas europe asia pacific corporate operations total revenues  net we operate in markets that are highly competitive  and our ability to evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes is critical to our success 
if we are unable to remain competitive and maintain our consumer loyalty  our business will be negatively affected 
we believe that our historical success is due to the development of an experienced team of designers  artists  sponsored athletes  technicians  researchers  merchandisers  pattern makers and contractors 
our team and the heritage and current strength of our brands has helped us remain competitive in our markets 
our success in the future will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to design products that are desirable in the marketplace and competitive in the areas of quality  brand image  technical specifications  distribution methods  price  customer service and intellectual property protection 

table of contents results of operations the table below shows certain components of our statements of operations and other data as a percentage of revenues year ended october  statements of operations data revenues  net gross profit selling  general and administrative expense asset impairments operating income interest expense foreign currency  minority interest and other expense income before provision for income taxes other data adjusted ebitda for a definition of adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation of income from continuing operations to adjusted ebitda  see footnote to the table under item selected financial data 
our financial performance has been  and may continue to be  negatively affected by unfavorable global economic conditions 
continued or further deteriorating economic conditions are likely to have an adverse impact on our sales volumes  pricing levels and profitability 
as domestic and international economic conditions change  trends in discretionary consumer spending also become unpredictable and subject to reductions due to uncertainties about the future 
when consumers reduce discretionary spending  purchases of apparel and footwear may decline 
a general reduction in consumer discretionary spending due to the recession in the domestic and international economies or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues our total net revenues increased in fiscal to  million from  million in fiscal primarily as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher unit sales 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million of the increase in total net revenues 
our net revenues in each of the americas  europe and asia pacific segments include apparel  footwear and accessories product lines for our quiksilver  roxy  dc and other brands which include hawk  raisins  leilani  radio fiji  lib technologies  gnu and bent metal 
revenues in the americas increased to  million for fiscal from million in the prior year  while european revenues increased to million from million and asia pacific revenues increased to million from million for those same periods 
in the americas  the increase in revenues came primarily from dc brand revenues  partially offset by small decreases in our quiksilver and roxy brand revenues 
the increase in dc brand revenues came primarily from growth in footwear and apparel product lines 
the decrease in quiksilver and roxy came across all product lines except for increases in our quiksilver footwear and roxy apparel product lines 
approximately million of europe s revenue increase was attributable to the positive effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates

table of contents gross profit our consolidated gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in the previous year 
the gross profit margin in the americas segment remained constant at  our european gross profit margin increased to from  and our asia pacific gross profit margin increased to from 
the americas gross profit margin would have increased due to higher percentages of sales through company owned retail stores  where we earn both wholesale and retail margins  and improved sourcing costs  but such improvements were wholly offset by market related price compression 
our european gross profit margin increases were primarily due to a higher percentage of our sales through company owned stores and improved sourcing costs 
in asia pacific  the gross profit margin increase compared to the prior year was primarily as a result of the change in mix to higher retail sales compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense sg a increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal in the americas  these expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  in europe they increased to million from million  and in asia pacific sg a increased to million from million for those same periods

the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenue in our americas segment was primarily due to the cost of opening and operating additional retail stores  increased costs resulting from operating our recently acquired latin american subsidiaries and increased marketing costs 
the increase in sg a costs as a percentage of revenue in our european segment was primarily due to the costs of opening and operating additional retail stores and increased distribution costs 
in our asia pacific segment  the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenue is primarily related to the cost of opening and operating additional retail stores and  to a lesser extent  a legal settlement on a retail store lease 
asset impairments asset impairment charges totaled million in fiscal compared to zero in fiscal of these charges  approximately million related to asia pacific goodwill  and approximately million related to the impairment of leasehold improvements and other assets in certain retail stores 
the goodwill and other impairment charges were recorded as a result of our annual impairment test  where it was determined that the carrying values of our assets were more than the estimated fair value as of october  separately  we analyzed the profitability of our retail stores and determined that a total of stores  primarily in the us  were not generating sufficient cash flows to recover our investment  of which are scheduled to close in we are evaluating the timing of the closure of the remaining stores and any costs associated with future rent commitments for these stores will be charged to future earnings upon store closure 
non operating expenses net interest expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily as a result of lower interest rates on our variable rate debt in the united states 
our foreign currency gain amounted to million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal this current year gain resulted primarily from the foreign exchange effect of certain non us dollar denominated liabilities 
our income tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the current year rate increased significantly due to the non deductibility of the goodwill asset impairment recorded in fiscal this increase was partially offset by changes in accrual amounts for certain tax contingencies accounted for under fin

gross profit our consolidated gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in the previous year 
the gross profit margin in the americas increased to from  our european gross profit margin increased to from  and our asia pacific gross profit margin increased to from 
the increase in the americas gross profit margin was primarily due to lower production costs and a higher percentage of sales through company owned retail stores where higher gross margins are generated 
our european and asia pacific gross profit margin increases were primarily due to higher margins from our apparel brands  largely as a result of the currency effect of sourcing goods in us dollars 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal in the americas  these expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  in europe they increased to million from million  and in asia pacific they increased to million from million for those same periods

non operating expenses net interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily as a result of the translation effect of euro denominated interest and  to a lesser extent  higher interest rates on our variable rate debt in europe and the united states 
our foreign currency loss amounted to million in fiscal compared to a gain of million in fiscal this current year loss resulted primarily from the foreign currency contracts that we used to mitigate the risk of translating the results of our international subsidiaries into us dollars and the foreign exchange effect of certain non us dollar denominated liabilities 
our income tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease was primarily caused by the higher impact of certain beneficial items included in our tax rate

table of contents financial position  capital resources and liquidity we generally finance our working capital needs and capital investments with operating cash flows and bank revolving lines of credit 
multiple banks in the united states  europe and australia make these lines of credit available to us 
term loans are also used to supplement these lines of credit and are typically used to finance long term assets 
in july  we issued million in senior notes to fund a portion of the rossignol purchase price and to refinance certain existing indebtedness 
we completed the sale of our rossignol business in november the net cash proceeds of approximately million were used to repay existing indebtedness 
as of october   we had  million of indebtedness classified in continuing operations 
we had an additional million of indebtedness classified in our discontinued operations  which was repaid in november as part of the close of the rossignol sale 
for the fiscal year ended october   we recorded approximately million of net interest expense  which includes million classified in discontinued operations related to the financing of our rossignol business 
rossignol interest includes interest on third party debt plus intercompany interest charged to rossignol by other quiksilver entities that  prior to the closing of the sale  financed rossignol s operations 
after the sale of rossignol  our continuing operations interest expense is expected to be higher as no interest will be allocated to that business 
however  we no longer have the obligation to fund the losses or capital expenditures of the rossignol business and we expect to improve our future debt leverage 
in october  we extended the maturity date for million of a million credit facility which was due in october 
in connection with this extension  we repaid million of the original million credit facility 
the remaining million is now due in march and is expected to be repaid with cash flows from the operations of our european business or refinanced on a long term basis 
we are highly leveraged  however  we believe that our cash flows from operations  together with our existing credit facilities will be adequate to fund our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
additionally  we are currently evaluating potential financing alternatives and plan to seek additional financing which includes extending the maturity of our short term uncommitted lines of credit in europe and asia pacific 
potential sources of alternative financing include our existing lenders for longer term financing  sales of assets and the broader capital markets 
we believe that we can obtain this additional financing needed to improve the maturities of our debt  reduce the amount of our short term uncommitted lines of credit and better position ourselves for the long term 
the availability and cost of new financing or asset sales are subject to certain risks and could be adversely affected by current credit and capital market conditions 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at october  versus million at october  working capital amounted to million at october   compared to million at october   a decrease of less than 
operating cash flows operating activities of continuing operations provided cash of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this million reduction was primarily due to decreased cash provided from working capital of million  partially offset by the effect of our net loss and other non cash charges which amounted to million 
capital expenditures we have historically avoided high levels of capital expenditures for our apparel manufacturing functions by using independent contractors for a majority of our production 
fiscal capital expenditures were million  which was approximately million higher than the million we spent in fiscal in fiscal  we increased our investment in company owned retail stores  warehouse equipment and computer systems 
capital expenditures for new company owned retail stores are expected to be reduced in fiscal a campus facility is being constructed for our european headquarters and computer hardware and software will also be purchased to continuously improve our systems 
capital spending for these and other 
table of contents projects in fiscal is expected to range between million and million 
we expect to fund our capital expenditures primarily from our operating cash flows and our credit facilities

the purchase price may be adjusted for certain items including an anticipated fair value adjustment to the seller s note due in november in connection with such disposition  we expect to incur a pre tax loss of approximately million  partially offset by an expected tax benefit of approximately million during the three months ending january  the business sold includes the related brands of rossignol  dynastar  look and lange

this transaction was completed in december for a transaction value of million

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to prepare these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates also affect our reported revenues and expenses 
judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the risk of ownership and title passes to our customers 
generally  we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral 
none of our sales agreements with any of our customers provide for any rights of return 
however  we do approve returns on a case by case basis at our sole discretion to protect our brands and our image 
we provide allowances for estimated returns when revenues are recorded  and related losses have historically been within our expectations 
if returns are higher than our estimates  our earnings would be adversely affected 

table of contents accounts receivable it is not uncommon for some of our customers to have financial difficulties from time to time 
this is normal given the wide variety of our account base  which includes small surf shops  medium sized retail chains  and some large department store chains 
throughout the year  we perform credit evaluations of our customers  and we adjust credit limits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor our collections and maintain a reserve for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
historically  our losses have been consistent with our estimates  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
unforeseen  material financial difficulties of our customers could have an adverse impact on our profits 
inventories we value inventories at the cost to purchase and or manufacture the product or the current estimated market value of the inventory  whichever is lower 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand  and adjust inventory values for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and market value 
demand for our products could fluctuate significantly 
the demand for our products could be negatively affected by many factors  including the following weakening economic conditions  terrorist acts or threats  unanticipated changes in consumer preferences  reduced customer confidence in the retail market  and unseasonable weather 
some of these factors could also interrupt the production and or importation of our products or otherwise increase the cost of our products 
as a result  our operations and financial performance could be negatively affected 
additionally  our estimates of product demand and or market value could be inaccurate  which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
long lived assets we acquire tangible and intangible assets in the normal course of our business 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of these long lived assets including fixed assets  trademarks licenses and other amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
impairments are recognized in operating earnings 
we continually use judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment tests  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
the reasonableness of our judgment could significantly affect the carrying value of our long lived assets 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is computed based on estimated future cash flows discounted at a rate that approximates our cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change  and we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our judgment 
if we subsequently 
table of contents determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down would  in our judgment  be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
on november   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 
the application of fin can create significant variability in our tax rate from period to period upon changes in or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest using the graded vested method over the requisite service period of the award 
for option valuation  we determine the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of certain assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based payment awards  stock price volatility and interest rates 
foreign currency translation a significant portion of our revenues are generated in europe  where we operate with the euro as our functional currency  and a smaller portion of our revenues are generated in asia pacific  where we operate with the australian dollar and japanese yen as our functional currencies 
our european revenues in the united kingdom are denominated in british pounds  and substantial portions of our european and asia pacific product is sourced in us dollars  both of which result in exposure to gains and losses that could occur from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
as part of our overall strategy to manage our level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we enter into various foreign exchange contracts generally in the form of forward contracts 
for all contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges  we record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives in other comprehensive income 
forward looking statements all statements included in this report  other than statements or characterizations of historical fact  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of examples of forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements regarding the trends and uncertainties in our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
these forward looking statements are based on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our industry  management s beliefs  and certain assumptions made by us and speak only as of the date of this report 
forward looking statements can often be identified by words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  predicts  believes  seeks  estimates  may  will  likely  should  would  could  potential  continue  ongoing  and similar expressions  and variations or negatives of these words 
in addition  any statements that refer to expectations  projections  guidance  forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances  including any underlying assumptions  are forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statement as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  the following continuing deterioration of global economic conditions and credit and capital markets  our ability to obtain new financing or refinancing on reasonable terms 
table of contents our ability to remain compliant with our debt covenants  our ability to achieve the financial results that we anticipate  our plans to open new retail stores  payments due on contractual commitments and other debt obligations  future expenditures for capital projects  our ability to continue to maintain our brand image and reputation  foreign exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in political  social and economic conditions and local regulations  particularly in europe and asia 
these forward looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements as a result of the risks described in item a 
risk factors included in this report  and other factors 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot assure you that the forward looking information contained herein will  in fact  transpire 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks 
two of these risks are foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates that affect interest expense 
see also note of our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency and derivatives we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain sales  royalty income and product purchases of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
we are also exposed to foreign currency gains and losses resulting from domestic transactions that are not denominated in us dollars  and to fluctuations in interest rates related to our variable rate debt 
furthermore  we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to the translation of the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting but are used by management to mitigate exposure to currency risks are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
a loss of million was recognized related to these types of contracts during the twelve months ended october   all of which is classified in discontinued operations 
for all qualifying cash flow hedges  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income 
as of october   we were hedging forecasted transactions expected to occur through september assuming exchange rates at october  remain constant  million of gains  net of tax  related to hedges of these transactions are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next months 
on the date we enter into a derivative contract  we designate certain of the derivatives as a hedge of the identified exposure 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for entering into various hedge transactions 
we identify in this documentation the asset  liability  firm commitment  or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and indicate how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item 
we formally measure effectiveness of our hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis in accordance with our risk management policy 
we will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item  when the derivative expires or is sold  terminated or exercised  if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction being hedged by the derivative will not occur  
table of contents because a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or if we determine that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
we enter into forward exchange and other derivative contracts with major banks and are exposed to foreign currency losses in the event of nonperformance by these banks 
we anticipate  however  that these banks will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
accordingly  we do not obtain collateral or other security to support the contracts 
translation of results of international subsidiaries as discussed above  we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we translate the local currency statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect our reported profits and can distort comparisons from year to year 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans to hedge the profit and loss effects of such exposure  but accounting rules do not allow us to hedge the actual translation of sales and expenses 
by way of example  when the us dollar strengthens compared to the euro  there is a negative effect on our reported results for our european operating segment 
it takes more profits in euros to generate the same amount of profits in stronger us dollars 
the opposite is also true 
that is  when the us dollar weakens there is a positive effect on the translation of our reported results from our european operating segment 
in fiscal  the us dollar weakened compared to the euro and the australian dollar 
as a result  our european revenues increased in euros compared to an increase of in us dollars 
asia pacific revenues increased in australian dollars compared to an increase of in us dollars 
interest rates most of our lines of credit and long term debt bear interest based on libor or euribor plus a credit spread 
effective interest rates  therefore  can move up or down depending on market conditions 
the credit spreads are subject to change based on financial performance and market conditions upon refinancing 
interest expense also includes financing fees and related costs and can be affected by foreign currency movement upon translating non us dollar denominated interest into dollars for reporting purposes 
the approximate amount of our remaining variable rate debt was million at october   and the average effective interest rate at that time was 
if interest rates or credit spreads were to increase by  our income before tax would be reduced by approximately million based on these fiscal levels
