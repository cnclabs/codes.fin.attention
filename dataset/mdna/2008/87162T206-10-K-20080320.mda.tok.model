item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements  related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing small molecule drugs to extend and enhance the lives of patients with severe medical conditions  including cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases 
we have a unique chemical compound library  an integrated discovery engine  and a diverse pipeline of clinical and preclinical stage drug candidates with distinct mechanisms of action and novel chemical structures 
we have three drug candidates in clinical trials  one drug candidate in preclinical studies  and one program in the lead optimization stage of discovery  as well as other programs in earlier stages of discovery 
we discovered and developed each of our drug candidates internally using our compound library and discovery capabilities 
at present  other than our lead drug candidate  elesclomol  we retain all rights to each of our drug candidates and programs  across all geographic markets and therapeutic indications 
we have entered into a partnership with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  for the joint development and commercialization of elesclomol 
our lead drug candidate  elesclomol formerly  sta our most advanced clinical stage drug candidate  elesclomol  is a novel  injectable  small molecule compound that triggers apoptosis  or programmed cell death  in cancer cells  which we believe has potential for the treatment of a broad range of cancer types 
in september  we announced positive results for elesclomol in combination with paclitaxel  a leading chemotherapeutic agent  in a double blind  randomized  controlled  multicenter phase b clinical trial in patients with stage iv metastatic melanoma 
we believe that this is the first blinded clinical trial of a drug candidate for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in years to meet its primary endpoint with statistical significance 
in november  we received fast track designation from the us food and drug administration  or fda  for the development of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma 
in december  we received orphan drug designation for elesclomol in this indication in the united states from the fda 
orphan drug status is designed to encourage biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for rare diseases affecting fewer than  people in the united states 
assuming that elesclomol is approved by the fda  we will be entitled to seven years of market exclusivity for elesclomol for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma 
based on the results of our phase b trial  we initiated a global  pivotal phase clinical trial of elesclomol in metastatic melanoma  called the symmetry trial  in the third quarter of the symmetry trial is being conducted under the terms of a special protocol assessment  or spa  agreed to by the fda 
the spa process provides for a written agreement between a clinical trial sponsor and the fda that the proposed design and planned analyses of the clinical trial is sufficient to support regulatory approval of a drug candidate  unless public health concerns unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment become evident 
the symmetry trial is enrolling patients with stage iv metastatic melanoma who have not received prior chemotherapy but who may have already been treated with non chemotherapeutic agents  such as biologics 
approximately patients will be enrolled in the blinded  randomized  controlled study  which generally mirrors the design of our phase b trial and will be conducted at approximately centers worldwide 
as with our prior phase b trial  patients enrolled in the symmetry trial will be randomized to receive either elesclomol plus paclitaxel or paclitaxel alone 
the dosage of each agent  the dosing schedule  and the primary endpoint progression free survival  or pfs are the same as in our prior phase b trial 
the symmetry trial increases the total number of patients enrolled from the prior phase b trial and includes central review of radiology scans  stratification to ensure balance between treatment and control arms  and a no crossover design for facilitating the assessment of overall survival  or os 
based on our current enrollment projections and event rate targets  we expect to complete enrollment and initiate the primary endpoint analysis of the symmetry trial by the end of assuming that the results of the pfs analysis are positive  we plan to submit a new drug application  or nda  to the fda in the first half of if actual enrollment or event rates differ from our current projections  our target dates for completing the pfs analysis and submitting the nda will likely change 
in october  we entered into a collaborative development  commercialization and license agreement with gsk for elesclomol  under which we are eligible to receive up to billion in milestones and other payments  as well as share of the profits and losses from sales in the united states and receive double digit tiered royalties from sales outside of the united states 
under the terms of the gsk agreement  the companies will jointly develop and commercialize elesclomol in the united states  and gsk will have exclusive responsibility for the development and commercialization of elesclomol outside the united states 
pursuant to the agreement  we received a non refundable upfront cash payment of million in november we are also eligible to receive potential pre commercial milestone payments from gsk of up to million  which include both payments for operational progress  such as trial initiation and enrollment  and payments for positive clinical and regulatory outcomes  such as regulatory approval 
of the million in potential payments  million are related to the development in metastatic melanoma and up to million are related to the development of elesclomol in other cancer indications 
in addition  we are eligible to receive up to million in potential commercial milestone payments from gsk based on achieving certain net sales thresholds 
we will take the lead role and fund  up to a specified amount  all activities related to seeking fda approval of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma 
we will also fund early clinical development of elesclomol in two other cancer indications 
all other worldwide development costs will be shared  with us responsible for a modest proportion of those costs 
in the united states  our share of the operating profits and losses from the commercialization and sales of elesclomol will be  with the percentage increasing as the level of annual sales increases 
we may elect not to participate in co commercialization  in which case we would earn royalties in lieu of profit sharing 
outside of the united states  we will receive double digit tiered royalties 
under the gsk agreement  gsk may  subject to our agreement  purchase up to million of our common stock in two separate tranches upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones 
in the first tranche  gsk would be obligated to buy million of our common stock at our sole discretion 
we attributed  of value to this option to require gsk to purchase our common stock 
the second tranche of million of common stock would be subject to the agreement of both us and gsk 
the per share purchase price under each tranche would be at a specified premium 
gsk may terminate the agreement upon not less than three months written notice at any time prior to the date of the first commercial sale of an elesclomol product and upon not less than six months written notice at any time on and after such date  in which case gsk may be obligated in certain circumstances to make additional payments to us 
under the gsk agreement  we have the right  but not the obligation to participate in various joint governance committees 
the agreement was subject to the hart scott rodino act and has received clearance by the us government 
our other oncology drug candidates and research programs sta sta is a novel  injectable  small molecule drug candidate we are developing for the treatment of cancer 
sta inhibits heat shock protein  or hsp  a chaperone protein that regulates the activity of numerous signaling proteins that trigger uncontrolled proliferation in cancer cells  in particular kinase proteins 
examples of kinase proteins include c kit  bcr abl  her  egfr  and others that are the targets of approved direct kinase inhibitors such as gleevec  herceptin  tarceva  and erbitux 
we believe that inhibiting kinases indirectly  by disrupting the chaperone activities of hsp  provides two advantages first  a means to simultaneously attack multiple cancer promoting kinases  and  second  an ability to kill tumor cells with mutated kinases that have lost responsiveness to a direct kinase inhibitor 
we have shown in preclinical experiments that sta is significantly more potent against certain types of cancer cells than gleevec  as well as the two hsp inhibitors furthest along in clinical development  aag and dmag 
sta is further differentiated from these hsp inhibitors because it is a novel chemical structure that is not a derivative or analog of the natural product geldanamycin 
we believe that this creates a distinct activity profile for sta and is a competitive advantage 
we are currently conducting two phase studies to identify the maximum tolerated dose of sta based on once and twice a week intravenous dosing schedules  respectively 
in addition to an evaluation of safety and tolerability  patients in these studies will be assessed for biological activity based on biomarker responses and clinical response rates based on the recist criteria 
sta sta is a novel  injectable  small molecule compound that disrupts the blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and essential nutrients 
in preclinical experiments  sta has shown strong anti tumor activity in a broad range of cancer models  including prostate  lung  breast  melanoma  and lymphoma 
in preclinical testing  sta has been shown to act against established tumor vessels  a mechanism that is differentiated from the mechanism of anti angiogenesis inhibitors such as avastin  which prevents the formation of new tumor vessels 
this program is currently in preclinical development 
autoimmune and inflammatory diseases apilimod sta 
apilimod is a novel  orally administered  small molecule drug candidate we are developing for the treatment of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory diseases 
apilimod inhibits the production of the cytokines interleukin  or il  and interleukin  or il  and thereby down regulates the inflammation pathways that underlie certain autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
we are currently conducting a phase a clinical trial of apilimod in patients with rheumatoid arthritis  or ra 
the preliminary results of the first patients in the ra trial showed encouraging biomarker and clinical signals suggesting activity of apilimod in this indication 
we have elected to enroll an additional cohort in the ra phase a trial to explore a higher dose of apilimod 
we expect to complete enrollment of this higher dose cohort in the second half of crac ion channel inhibitor 
we have developed novel  small molecule inhibitors of calcium release activated calcium  or crac  ion channels expressed on immune cells 
the crac ion channel is the primary route for calcium entry into t cells and other immune cells  regulating multiple immune cell processes important for initiating and maintaining an inflammatory immune response 
we have demonstrated in preclinical experiments that our crac ion channel inhibitors selectively inhibit the production of critical pro inflammatory cytokines  such as interleukin  or il  and tnfa by immune cells  and that these compounds are effective in multiple animal models of immune diseases  including models of arthritis 
this program is in the lead optimization stage of discovery 
initial public offering in february  we raised million in gross proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in our initial public offering  or the ipo  at per share 
the net offering proceeds to us after deducting approximately million in expenses for underwriters discounts  fees and commissions  legal  accounting  printing  listing and filing fees  and miscellaneous expenses were approximately million 
all outstanding shares of our series a convertible preferred stock and million in accumulated dividends on the series a convertible preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock upon the completion of the ipo 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  and eitf no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  we recorded a non cash beneficial conversion charge of approximately million in february in connection with the contingent adjustable conversion feature of the series a convertible preferred stock 
we were incorporated in march and commenced operations in july since that time  we have been principally engaged in raising capital and in the discovery and development of novel drug candidates 
since our inception  we have had no revenues from product sales 
we have funded our operations principally with million in net proceeds from private placements of our common stock  million in net proceeds from a private placement of our series a convertible preferred stock  million in net proceeds from our initial public offering  and an million non refundable upfront payment under the gsk agreement  which  together with the exercise of common stock warrants and options  provided aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million through december  we have devoted substantially all of our capital resources to the research and development of our drug candidates 
we have never been profitable and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates from discovery through preclinical development and clinical trials and seek regulatory approval and eventual commercialization 
in addition to these increasing research and development expenses  we expect general and administrative costs to increase in connection with additional headcount  public company requirements and compliance  commercial development and medical community relations  as we  together with gsk  prepare for the potential launch of elesclomol 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and may never do so 
financial operations overview revenue we have not yet generated any product revenue and do not expect to generate any product revenue for the foreseeable future 
we will seek to generate revenue from product sales and from future collaborative or strategic relationships  which could include research and development  milestone payments  profit sharing and royalties 
in october  we entered into the gsk agreement with gsk for our lead drug candidate  elesclomol 
the million non refundable upfront payment we received from gsk in november  together with the  estimated value of an option to require gsk to purchase million of our common stock  is being recognized as collaboration revenue using the time based model over the estimated performance period  the year period through the earliest expiration date of the related patents  which we estimate to be the effective life of the gsk agreement see revenue recognition in the critical accounting policies and estimates section 
in  we recognized  of collaboration revenue under the gsk agreement 
in the future  we expect any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments received under the gsk agreement and from future collaborations or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our drug candidates  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development research and development expense consists of costs incurred in connection with developing and advancing our drug discovery technology and identifying and developing our drug candidates 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
our research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with research  preclinical and clinical activities  payments to third party contract research organizations  investigative sites and consultants in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs  costs associated with drug formulation and supply of drugs for clinical trials  personnel related expenses  including salaries  stock based compensation  benefits and travel  and overhead expenses  including rent and maintenance of our facilities  and laboratory and other supplies 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing our drug candidates 
while expenses associated with the completion of our current clinical programs are expected to be substantial and increase  we believe that accurately projecting total program specific expenses through commercialization is not possible at this time 
the timing and amount of these expenses will depend upon the costs associated with potential future clinical trials of our drug candidates  and the related expansion of our research and development organization  regulatory requirements  advancement of our preclinical programs and product manufacturing costs  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development  including with respect to the number of clinical sites included in the trial  the length of time required to enroll suitable subjects  the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials  and the efficacy and safety results of our clinical trials and the number of additional required clinical trials 
our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties  including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending or enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may obtain unexpected or unfavorable results from our clinical trials 
we may elect to discontinue  delay or modify clinical trials of some drug candidates or focus on others 
a change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables in the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate  or if we experience significant delays in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
additionally  future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will evolve and therefore impact our clinical development programs and plans over time 
despite this uncertainty  however  our development strategy for our lead clinical stage drug candidate  elesclomol  is currently based on a number of assumptions that allow us to make broad estimates of certain clinical trial expenses 
we initiated the symmetry trial  our global  pivotal phase clinical trial of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  in the third quarter of  and we expect the remaining costs necessary for the nda submission  including the cost of the clinical trial  clinical drug supplies  registration manufacturing and regulatory activities necessary to compile the nda submission  together with the costs of related nonclinical toxicology and other testing to support the trial  will be in the range of million to million 
we do not expect to receive regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates until at the earliest  if at all 
beyond our three lead drug candidates  we anticipate that we will select drug candidates and research projects for further development on an ongoing basis in response to their preclinical and clinical success  as well as commercial potential 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in executive  finance  business and commercial development  investor and medical community relations  human resources and administrative functions 
other costs include stock based compensation costs  directors and officers liability insurance premiums  legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property  fees for general legal  accounting  public company requirements and compliance  and other professional services  as well as overhead related costs not otherwise included in research and development 
we anticipate increases in costs of commercial development and medical community relations  as we  together with gsk  prepare for the potential launch of elesclomol 
convertible preferred stock dividends convertible preferred stock dividends consisted of cumulative but undeclared dividends that were payable on our series a convertible preferred stock 
the series a convertible preferred stock accrued dividends at per year 
all outstanding shares of our series a convertible preferred stock and the million in accumulated dividends were converted into  shares of our common stock upon completion of the ipo in february critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we are required to make estimates and judgments with respect to accrued expenses  acquisitions and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to aid you in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition collaboration and license agreements our principal sources of revenue may include upfront payments  development milestone payments  reimbursements of development costs  profit sharing payments  sales milestones and royalties from our collaborations 
we recognize revenue from these sources in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  or sab  emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or eitf no 
 and eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf no 
the application of eitf no 
requires subjective analysis and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about whether deliverables within multiple element arrangements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual arrangement into separate units of accounting and to determine the fair value to be allocated to each unit of accounting 
we entered into the gsk agreement with gsk in october we evaluated the multiple deliverables within the gsk agreement in accordance with the provisions of eitf no 
to determine whether the delivered elements that are our obligation have value to gsk on a stand alone basis and whether objective reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items exists 
deliverables that meet these criteria are considered a separate unit of accounting 
deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined and accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
the appropriate recognition of revenue is then applied to each separate unit of accounting 
our deliverables under the gsk agreement  including the related rights and obligations  contractual cash flows and performance periods  are more fully described in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and are considered a single unit of accounting 
the gsk agreement consists of the following key funding streams a non refundable upfront payment  product development milestone payments  reimbursements of certain development costs  sales milestone payments  profit sharing payments and product royalty payments 
the cash flows associated with the single unit of accounting from the development portion of the gsk agreement are recognized as revenue using a time based model 
under this model  cash flow streams are recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period 
upon receipt of cash payments  revenue is recognized to the extent the accumulated service time  if any  has occurred 
the remainder is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining estimated performance period 
a change in the period of time expected to complete the deliverable is accounted for as a change in estimate on a prospective basis 
revenue is limited to amounts that are nonrefundable and that gsk is contractually obligated to pay us 
the million non refundable upfront payment we received from gsk in november  together with the  estimated value of an option to require gsk to purchase million of our common stock  is being recognized as collaboration revenue using the time based model over the estimated performance period  the year period through the earliest expiration date of the related patents  which we estimate to be the effective life of the gsk agreement 
we are also recognizing product development milestone payments and reimbursements of development costs as collaboration revenue using the time based model over the same performance period through november based on the guidance of eitf no 
 we have determined that we are acting as a principal under the gsk agreement and  as such  have recorded these amounts as collaboration revenue 
in  we recognized  of collaboration revenue under the gsk agreement 
profit sharing payments are based upon a formula that provides for a range of of net profits earned on us sales of products included in the gsk agreement 
royalty revenues are based upon a percentage of sales in non us territories 
profit sharing payments and royalties from the sales of products included in the gsk agreement will be recorded on the accrual basis when results are reliably measurable  collectability is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
sales milestones  which are based upon the achievement of certain agreed upon sales thresholds  will be recorded when the respective sales threshold is achieved and collectability is reasonably assured 
deferred collaboration revenue consistent with our policy on revenue recognition  deferred collaboration revenue represents cash received in advance for licensing fees  option fees  consulting  research and development contracts and related cost sharing and supply agreements 
such payments are reflected as deferred collaboration revenue until revenue can be recognized under our revenue recognition policy 
deferred collaboration revenue is classified as current if management believes we will complete the earnings process and be able to recognize the deferred amount as revenue within months of the balance sheet date 
at december   total deferred collaboration revenue was approximately million  of which million was current and will be recognized as revenue during accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
given our current business  the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our business is with respect to service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in connection with all of the foregoing service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided 
the majority of our service providers  including contract research organizations  invoice us in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
we currently reflect the over or under accrual of expenses directly in our operations in the period the amount was determined 
our arrangements with contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed 
we recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion 
the date on which services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us based on the terms of the contract or our ongoing monitoring of service performance 
in the years ended december   and  respectively  we had arrangements with multiple contract research organizations whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods 
we currently recognize and plan to continue to recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations 
generally  these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial  monitoring the trial  closing the trial and preparing the resulting data 
with respect to financial reporting periods presented in this annual report on form k  and based on our receipt of invoices from our third party providers  the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs 
in light of the foregoing  we do not believe our estimates of future expenses and our practice of making judgments concerning the accrual of expenses are reasonably likely to change in the future 
there were no changes in our estimates and accruals for contract service fees that had a material effect on our net losses in the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  for stock based awards to employees  using the modified prospective method of transition for awards granted after january  valued using the fair value method  and using the prospective method for awards granted prior to january  valued using the minimum value method 
therefore  compensation cost recognized in the years ended december  and includes compensation costs related to the vesting of stock options granted after january  but prior to january   based on the grant date fair value method estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
 adjusted for estimated forfeitures  compensation costs related to the continued vesting of nonvested restricted stock awards granted prior to january   and compensation costs for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to january   based on the provisions of sfas no 
r 
we continue to use the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate valuation method for our option grants 
the black scholes model requires inputs for risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility and expected lives of the options 
since we do not have a significant history of stock trading activity  expected volatility is based on historical data from several public companies similar in size and value to us 
we will continue to use a weighted average approach using historical volatility and other similar public entity volatility information until historical volatility of our common stock is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical data 
our options generally vest after one year of service and quarterly over three years thereafter 
based on an analysis of historical forfeitures  we applied a forfeiture rate of to all options that vest upon completion of the first year of service following the date of grant 
the analysis will be re evaluated at least annually and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
the expected lives for options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
since january   we have used the simplified method for determining the expected lives of options 
for awards with graded vesting  we allocate compensation costs under sfas no 
r on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
accordingly  we amortized the fair value of each option over each option s service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we account for stock options issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees  or in conjunction with selling goods or services  which requires valuing and remeasuring such stock options to the current fair value until the performance date has been reached 
certain of our options granted to non employees that are fully vested and no longer subject to a performance requirement are subject to eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  which requires the stock options held by certain non employee consultants to be accounted for as liability awards 
the fair value of these vested and unexercised awards was recognized as liability awards starting in april following the registration of stock options under form s  using the black scholes model 
as of december   a liability of  was reflected in the balance sheet as other current liabilities 
the fair value of the award is re measured at each financial statement reporting date until the options are exercised or expire 
when and if non employee consultants exercise their options or the options expire  the corresponding liability will be reclassified to equity 
as of december   vested stock options to acquire  shares of common stock held by non employee consultants remained unexercised 
our net loss for the years ended december  and includes million and million  respectively  of compensation costs and no income tax benefit related to our stock based compensation arrangements for employee and non employee awards 
as of december   the total amount of unrecognized stock based compensation expense is million  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue year ended december  to change dollars in millions revenues in october  we entered into a collaborative development  commercialization and license agreement with gsk for elesclomol 
under the terms of the gsk agreement  the companies will jointly develop and commercialize elesclomol in the united states  and gsk will have exclusive responsibility for the development and commercialization of elesclomol outside the united states 
the million non refundable upfront payment we received from gsk in november  together with the  estimated value of an option to require gsk to purchase million of our common stock  is being recognized as collaboration revenue using the time based model over the estimated performance period  the year period through the earliest expiration date of the related patents  which we estimate to be the effective life of this agreement see notes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
research and development expense year ended december  to change dollars in millions clinical stage drug candidates elesclomol apilimod sta total clinical stage drug candidates early stage and discontinued programs total research and development in the year ended december   costs incurred under our elesclomol program increased by million over the year ended december   including a million increase for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and an million increase for external costs 
these increases were principally due to start up expenses incurred in connection with the symmetry trial  our global  pivotal phase clinical trial of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  which was initiated in the third quarter of  offset by non recurring external costs incurred in in connection with the completion of the phase b clinical trial for metastatic melanoma

these decreases were principally due to the advancement of the program from preclinical development into clinical development upon the filing of an investigational new drug application in the third quarter of and the initiation of two phase clinical trials in the fourth quarter of in addition  in the year ended december   costs incurred under our early stage and discontinued programs decreased by million over the year ended december   including a million increase for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  offset by a million decrease for external costs 
general and administrative expense year ended december  to change dollars in millions general and administrative the increase in general and administrative expense principally resulted from increases of million for personnel costs and related overhead in connection with increased headcount  and million in external professional fees  including investor and medical community relations  public company reporting and compliance requirements and increased director and officer insurance premiums following completion of our ipo in february  and intellectual property and general legal fees  as well as a million increase in stock based compensation 
investment income  net year ended december  to change dollars in millions investment income  net the increase in net investment income was principally due to the higher average cash balances resulting from the net cash proceeds of million raised from the sale of our common stock in the ipo in february and the million non refundable upfront payment received from gsk in november net loss year ended december  to change dollars in millions except for net loss per share net loss basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders the increase in the basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders was principally due to the non cash beneficial conversion charge of approximately million that was recognized in february in connection with the contingent adjustable conversion feature of the series a convertible preferred stock that converted into common stock upon the completion of the ipo in february  offset in part by an increase in the number of weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the sale of  shares of common stock and the conversion of the series a preferred stock and accumulated dividends into  shares of common stock in connection with the ipo

net loss year ended december  to change dollars in millions except for net loss per share net loss basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders the decreases in net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders were principally due to the completion of several clinical trials in and in the first half of liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception 
we have funded our operations principally with million in net proceeds from private placements of our common stock  million in net proceeds from a private placement of our series a convertible preferred stock  million in net proceeds from the ipo  and the million non refundable upfront payment under the gsk agreement  which  together with the exercise of common stock warrants and options  provided aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million through december  we have also generated funds from government grant revenues  equipment lease financings and investment income

based on our current operating plans  we expect to receive between million and million in operational progress milestone payments in under our equipment lease agreement  we may periodically directly lease  or sell and lease back up to a maximum outstanding balance of million of equipment and leasehold improvements 
in june  this agreement was extended through june as of december   approximately million was available under this revolving lease line for future property and equipment expenditures

contractual obligations and commitments the following tables summarize our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions 
contractual obligations as of december  total through through more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations research and development contracts consulting purchase obligations total including scheduled interest payments 
research and development contracts principally include contracts for human clinical studies  animal studies and clinical manufacturing 
the future research and development contract obligations in the table of contractual obligations above assume that each of the studies and related manufacturing contracts is completed as planned 
in the event a study or manufacturing contract is terminated prior to planned completion by mutual agreement between the contractor and us  the amount paid under such contracts may be less than the amounts presented 
under various license agreements  substantially all of which are related to our early stage discovery programs  we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of million if specified development and commercialization milestones are met  as follows in thousands 
these amounts are not included in the table of contractual obligations above 
milestone amount phase clinical trials phase clinical trials phase clinical trials completion of phase clinical trials fda new drug approval  european market approval other total  funding requirements we expect to incur substantial expenses and generate significant operating losses as we continue to advance our drug candidates into preclinical studies and clinical trials and as we complete the symmetry trial  our global  pivotal phase clinical trial of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  that was initiated in the third quarter of  and initiate phase clinical trials of elesclomol in other cancer types  begin to perform and fund pre commercialization activities  and establish sales and marketing functions and commercial manufacturing arrangements for elesclomol  consistent with our obligations under our agreement with gsk  complete the current phase a clinical trial of apilimod for the treatment of ra  and possibly initiate phase clinical trials of apilimod in other inflammatory disease indications  initiate additional phase clinical trials of elesclomol in other cancer types and one or more phase clinical trials of apilimod  if supported by phase results  complete two phase clinical trials of sta that were initiated in the fourth quarter of  initiate additional phase trials and initiate any later stage additional clinical trials  if supported by phase results  complete preclinical development of sta and initiate clinical trials  if supported by positive preclinical data  advance our crac ion channel inhibitor program into clinical trials  if supported by positive preclinical data  discover  develop  and seek regulatory approval for backups of our current drug candidates and other new drug candidates  identify additional compounds or drug candidates and acquire rights from third parties to those compounds or drug candidates through licenses  acquisition or other means  commercialize any approved drug candidates  hire additional clinical  scientific  and management personnel  and add operational  financial  and management information systems and personnel 
our funding requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  including the completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current drug candidates and the results from these studies and trials  the number of drug candidates we advance into later stage clinical trials and the scope of our research and development programs  our ability to discover additional drug candidates using our drug discovery technology and advance them into clinical development  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims for our drug discovery technology and drug candidates and avoiding infringing the intellectual property of others  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our drug candidates  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements  including our agreement with gsk  the potential in licensing of other products or technologies or the acquisition of complementary businesses  the cost of manufacturing  marketing and sales activities  if any  and the timing  receipt and amount of revenue  if any  from our drug candidates 
we do not anticipate that we will generate product revenue for the next several years 
we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in cash used in operations over the next several years 
based on our current operating plans  we expect our existing funds will be sufficient to fund operations through at least payment to us by gsk of milestones for our operational progress and achievement of certain success criteria leading to the approval by the fda of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma could extend our cash availability  as could payments of milestones in connection with the development of elesclomol in other cancer indications and achievement of certain net sales thresholds 
based on our current operating plans  we expect to receive between million and million in operational progress milestone payments  under our agreement with gsk  in however  we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to conduct additional clinical trials and seek regulatory approval of our drug candidates 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling debt securities  if convertible  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  collaboration agreements  debt financings or licensing arrangements 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to terminate  significantly modify or delay our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts  or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million consisting of cash deposited in a highly rated financial institution in the united states and in short term money market funds 
subsequent to year end we transferred our invested funds to a short term us treasury money market fund 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we did not have material exposure to high risk investments  such as mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities or other special investment vehicles  or siv s  within our money market fund investments 
we also believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities of financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
tax loss carryforwards in and in  we performed analyses to determine if there were changes in ownership  as defined by section of the internal revenue code  that would limit our ability to utilize certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we determined that we experienced a change in ownership  as defined by section  in connection with the acquisition of principia associates  inc on september   but did not experience a change in ownership upon the effectiveness of our ipo 
as a result  the utilization of our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change is limited 
as of december  we have net operating loss carryforwards for us federal tax purposes of approximately million  after taking into consideration net operating losses expected to expire unused as a result of this limitation  and the remainder will expire in varying amounts through unless utilized 
in addition  as of december   we have state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which will expire through unless utilized 
the utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited as we experience future ownership changes as defined in section of the internal revenue code

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million consisting of cash deposited in a highly rated financial institution in the united states and in short term money market funds 
subsequent to year end we transferred our invested funds to a short term us treasury money market fund 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes

we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
during the year ended december   we had investment income of million 
if overall interest rates fell by during the year ended december   our interest income would have decreased by less than million  assuming consistent investment levels 
capital market risk 
we currently have no product revenues and depend on funds raised through other sources 
one possible source of funding is through further equity offerings 
our ability to raise funds in this manner depends upon capital market forces affecting our stock price
