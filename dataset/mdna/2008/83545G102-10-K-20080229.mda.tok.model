item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the sonic automotive  inc and subsidiaries consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the financial and statistical data contained in the following discussion for all periods presented reflects our december  classification of franchises between continuing and discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
overview we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states 
as of february   we operated dealership franchises  representing different brands of cars and light trucks  at locations and collision repair centers in states 
our dealerships provide comprehensive services including sales of both new and used cars and light trucks  sales of replacement parts  performance of vehicle maintenance  manufacturer warranty repairs  paint and collision repair services  and arrangement of extended service contracts  financing  insurance and other aftermarket products for our customers 
although vehicle sales are cyclical and are affected by many factors  including general economic conditions  consumer confidence  levels of discretionary personal income  interest rates and available credit  our parts  service and collision repair services are not closely tied to vehicle sales and are not as dependent upon near term sales volume 
as a result  we believe the diversity of these products and services reduces the risk of periodic economic downturns 
the automobile industry s total amount of new vehicles sold decreased by to million vehicles in from million vehicles in from an industry perspective  new vehicle unit sales on a year over year basis grew for import brands and contracted for domestic brands 
many factors such as brand and geographic concentrations have caused our past results to differ from the industry s overall trend 
we sell similar products and services that exhibit similar economic characteristics  use similar processes in selling our products and services and sell our products and services to similar classes of customers 
as a result of this and the way we manage our business  we have a single operating segment for purposes of reporting financial condition and results of operations 
in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate our dealership franchises for possible disposition based on various performance criteria 
during the year ended december   we disposed of franchises and had approved  but not completed  the disposition of additional franchises 
these franchises have been identified as held for sale because of unprofitable operations or other strategic considerations 
we believe the disposition of these franchises will allow us to focus our management attention on those remaining stores with the highest potential return on investment 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the following is a discussion of what we believe are our critical accounting policies and estimates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our accounting policies 
finance  insurance and service contracts we arrange financing for customers through various financial institutions and receive a commission from the lender either in a flat fee amount or in an amount equal to the difference between the actual interest rates charged to customers and the predetermined base rates set by the financing institution 
we also receive commissions from the sale of various insurance contracts and non recourse third party extended service contracts to customers 
under these contracts  the applicable manufacturer or third party warranty company is directly liable for all warranties provided within the contract 
in the event a customer terminates a financing  insurance or extended service contract prior to the original termination date  we may be required to return a portion of the commission revenue originally recorded to the third party provider chargebacks 
the commission revenue for the sale of these products and services is recorded net of estimated chargebacks at the time of sale 
our estimate of future chargebacks is established based on our historical chargeback rates  termination provisions of the applicable contracts and industry data 
while chargeback rates vary depending on the type of contract sold  a basis point change in the estimated chargeback rates used in determining our estimates of future chargebacks would have changed our estimated reserve for chargebacks at december  by approximately million 
our estimate of chargebacks million as of december  is influenced by early contract termination events such as vehicle repossessions  refinancings and early pay off 
if these factors change  the resulting impact is a change in our estimate for chargebacks 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment might have occurred 
based on criteria established by the applicable accounting pronouncements  we have one reporting unit 
there was  million of goodwill on our balance sheet  including approximately million classified in assets held for sale  at december  in evaluating goodwill for impairment  if the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we are then required to proceed to the second step of the impairment test 
the second step involves allocating the calculated fair value to all of the assets of the reporting unit as if the calculated fair value was the purchase price in a business combination 
this allocation would include assigning value to any previously unrecognized identifiable assets including franchise assets which means the remaining fair value that would be allocated to goodwill would be significantly reduced 
see discussion regarding franchise agreements acquired prior to july  in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we would then compare the fair value of the goodwill resulting from this allocation process to the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit with the difference representing the amount of impairment 
in completing step one of the impairment analysis  we use various fair value approaches which consist of an earnings multiple model and a discounted cash flow model 
the results from each of these models are then analyzed to determine if an indicator of impairment exists 
the primary assumptions used in these various models include historical pretax earnings  estimated average earnings multiples of public automotive retailers  future growth assumptions  weighted average cost of capital along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
to the extent the reporting unit s earnings decline significantly or there are changes in one or more of these assumptions that would result in lower valuation results  it could cause the carrying value of the reporting unit to exceed its fair value and thus require us to conduct the second step of the impairment test described above 
at december   the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit step one of the above described impairment test 
as a result  we were not required to conduct the second step of the impairment test described above 
however  if in future periods we determine that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we believe that application of the second step of the impairment test would result in a substantial impairment charge to goodwill and the amount of such impairment charge would likely be materially adverse to our consolidated operating results and financial position for the period in which the charge would be recorded 
insurance reserves we have various self insured and high deductible insurance programs which require us to make estimates in determining the ultimate liability we may incur for claims arising under these programs 
we accrue for insurance reserves on a pro rata basis throughout the year based on the expected year end liability 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made quarterly by our management based on available information and take into consideration annual actuarial evaluations based on historical claims experience  claims processing procedures  medical cost trends and  in certain cases  a discount factor 
if our management receives information which causes us to change our estimate of the year end liability  the amount of expense or expense reduction required to be recorded in any particular quarter could be material to our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
we estimate the ultimate liability under these programs is between million and million 
at december   we had million reserved for such programs 
we used a discount rate of to calculate the present value of our estimated workers compensation claims 
a discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of our general liability claim reserves 
a basis point change in the discount rate or a basis point change in the selected loss cost estimate would not have a significant impact on the reserve balance 
lease exit accruals the majority of our dealership properties are leased under long term operating lease arrangements 
when leased properties are no longer utilized in operations  we record lease exit accruals 
these situations could include the relocation of an existing facility or the sale of a franchise where the buyer will not be subleasing the property for either the remaining term of the lease or for an amount equal to our obligation under the lease 
the lease exit accruals represent the present value of the lease payments  net of estimated sublease rentals  for the remaining life of the operating leases and other accruals necessary to satisfy lease commitments to the landlords 
at december   we had million accrued for lease exit costs 
legal proceedings we are involved  and expect to continue to be involved  in numerous legal proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business  including litigation with customers  employment related lawsuits  contractual disputes and actions brought by governmental authorities 
as of december   we had accrued million in legal reserves included in other accrued liabilities 
currently  with the exception of the galura litigation matter discussed in item legal proceedings herein  no legal proceedings are pending against or involve us that  in the opinion of management  could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and prospects 
classification of franchises in continuing and discontinued operations we classify the results from operations of our continuing and discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income based on the provisions of sfas no 
many of these provisions involve judgment in determining whether a franchise will be reported as continuing or discontinued operations 
such judgments include whether a franchise will be sold or terminated  the period required to complete the disposition and the likelihood of changes to a plan for sale 
if in future periods we determine that a franchise should be either reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations or from discontinued operations to continuing operations  previously reported consolidated statements of income may be reclassified in order to reflect that classification 
income taxes as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and from time to time  these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes 
we believe that our tax positions comply  in all material respects  with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
included in other accrued liabilities at december  is million in reserves that we have provided for these matters including estimates related to possible interest and penalties in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with fin from time to time  we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty 
examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and disposals  including consideration paid or received in connection with such transactions 
significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adjust our estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities  as well as changes in tax laws  regulations and precedent 
the effects on our financial statements of income tax uncertainties are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes 
we have million in deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards that will expire between and management reviews these carryforward positions  the time remaining until expiration and other opportunities to utilize these carryforwards in making an assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that these carryforwards will be utilized 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million in based on our judgment that certain state carryforwards will not be utilized 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance related to our remaining carryforwards because we have concluded it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of the associated deferred tax assets 
however  the results of future operations  regulatory framework of these taxing authorities and other related matters cannot be predicted with certainty 
therefore  actual utilization of the losses which created these deferred tax assets which differs from the assumptions used in the development of our judgment could result in a charge that would be materially adverse to our consolidated operating results  financial position and cash flows 
we accrue for income taxes on a pro rata basis throughout the year based on the expected year end liability 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made quarterly by our management based on available information and take into consideration estimated income taxes based on prior year income tax returns  changes in income tax law  our income tax strategies and other factors 
if our management receives information which causes us to change our estimate of the year end liability  the amount of expense or expense reduction required to be recorded in any particular quarter could be material to our operating results  financial position and cash flows

the cost of sales line item includes the cost of new and used vehicles  vehicle parts and all costs directly linked to servicing customer vehicles 
during the year ended december   we disposed of franchises  and had approved  but not completed  the disposition of additional franchises 
the results of operations of these dealerships  including gains or losses on disposition  have been included in discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
in addition to these dispositions  during the years ended december  and  we disposed of and franchises  respectively 
annual same store results of operations represent the aggregate of the same store results for each of the four quarters in that year 
same store results for each quarter include dealerships that were owned and operated for the entire quarter in both periods and were classified as continuing operations under sfas no 
at december  unless otherwise noted  our discussion of the results of operations from new vehicles to gross profit and gross margins is on a same store basis 
new vehicles new vehicle revenues include the sale and lease of new vehicles  as well as the sale of fleet vehicles 
new vehicle revenues are highly dependent on manufacturer incentives  which vary from cash back incentives to low interest rate financing 
new vehicle revenues are also dependent on manufacturers to provide adequate vehicle allocations to meet customer demands 
the automobile manufacturing industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
as an automotive retailer  we seek to mitigate the effects of this cyclicality by maintaining a diverse mix of branded dealerships 
our brand diversity allows us to offer a broad range of products at a wide range of prices from lower priced  or economy vehicles  to luxury vehicles 
we believe that this diversity reduces the risk of changes in customer preferences  product supply shortages and aging products 
for the year ended december   of our total new vehicle revenue was generated by import and luxury dealerships compared to for we expect this trend toward more import and domestic luxury dealerships to continue 
we believe demographic and other trends favor import and luxury brands and expect our acquisition activity in the future to concentrate primarily  but not completely  on these brands 
for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total new vehicle units same store acquisitions and other total as reported total new vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported total new vehicle unit price same store total dealerships as reported same store new vehicle revenue and unit sales were negatively impacted by economic softness in our california and florida markets  where we have a significant number of luxury and import dealerships 
these conditions directly affected the performance of our import stores which underperformed the industry unit volume increase of  while our domestic stores outperformed the industry decrease of 
our import dealerships experienced a decrease of  units  or  while our domestic dealerships experienced a decrease of  units  or 
these overall import and domestic same store new vehicle unit decreases can also be attributed to a decline in new truck and suv units from to of  units  or 
declining truck and suv sales resulted from increasing gasoline prices  a downturn in the housing market and other economic uncertainties 
our bmw stores realized an increase in unit volume for of units  or 
additionally  our bmw dealerships posted the largest increase in new suv unit sales when compared to our mercedes dealerships experienced the most significant decline in sales volume among our import stores  decreasing by units  or  as compared to our gm excluding cadillac dealerships experienced a decline in new retail unit volume  but strong fleet sales led to an overall improvement in total new unit sales volume 
both our cadillac and ford stores posted decreases in same store new vehicle unit sales decreasing by  units  or and  units  or  respectively 
the increase in our average price per unit in can be attributed mainly to a larger percentage of our sales being generated by higher priced luxury vehicles 
many of our import dealerships experienced average price per unit increases  most notably  toyota and bmw up and  respectively 
all of our domestic dealerships experienced average price per unit increases 
our ford dealerships experienced the most significant improvement in sales price per unit of our domestic stores  increasing by  or  during during  our increase in same store new vehicle unit sales was driven entirely by our import dealerships  which experienced an increase of  units  or  while our domestic dealerships experienced a decrease of units  or  as compared to this is compared to an industry increase in unit sales at import dealerships of  and a decrease in the industry domestic unit sales of 
our top performing import brands for were toyota and mercedes  which posted increases of  units  or  and units  or  respectively 
these increases can be attributed to the introduction of new models  in addition to new body styling and design on existing models 
additionally  our bmw stores posted a revenue increase despite a slight decline in unit volume 
our honda dealerships experienced the most significant decline in sales volume among our import stores  decreasing by units  or  as compared to our top performing domestic brand was ford  which posted an increase of units  or 
our gm excluding cadillac dealerships experienced a decline in new retail unit volume of units  or  but strong fleet sales with an increase of units  or  helped to offset that decline 
additionally  our cadillac stores posted an improvement in fleet sales of units  or  which offset the domestic decline in new unit volume 
many of our import dealerships experienced average price per unit increases  most notably being mercedes  bmw and honda up  and  respectively 
on the domestic side  our ford and cadillac dealerships experienced the most significant increases in average sales price per unit up and  respectively 
the increases at these dealerships can be attributed to both the various pricing strategies put in place by ford and gm during  which lowered pricing  and a shift from car sales to truck and suv sales during used vehicles used vehicle revenues are directly affected by the level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  the number and quality of trade ins and lease turn ins and the availability of consumer credit 
in addition  various manufacturers provide franchised dealers the opportunity to certify pre owned vehicles based on criteria established by the manufacturer 
this certification process extends the standard manufacturer warranty 
on a continuing operations basis  our sales of cpo vehicles increased slightly in to of total used vehicle units from in our sales of non cpo used vehicles experienced an increase of  units or during these increases were partially due to an increased focus on used cars  the continued implementation of a standardized merchandising process that includes the retailing of value used vehicles  along with an improved inventory management system at a number of our stores 
additionally  industry pricing improvements affected the value of used vehicles  as the manheim used vehicle value index increased from december to december for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total used vehicle units same store acquisitions and other total as reported total used vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported total used vehicle unit price same store total dealerships as reported in  the overall increase in average used price per unit of when compared to can be mainly attributed to a continuing shift in our dealership mix towards more import and luxury dealerships which tend to retail higher priced used vehicles 
our import dealerships posted an increase in used unit volume of  or 
our bmw and mercedes stores posted the most significant increases in used unit volume  and  respectively 
our cadillac stores posted the only increase in used unit volume among our domestic brands 
our ford and gm excluding cadillac stores posted small declines in used unit volume of and  respectively 
during  our import dealerships contributed to the overall improvement in used unit volume by posting an increase of  units  or  when compared to of our import stores  bmw  mercedes and toyota posted the most significant increases in used unit volume 
our domestic dealerships also posted an improvement in used unit sales volume  increasing by units  or 
cadillac was the largest contributor to the domestic increase in unit volume 
wholesale vehicles wholesale vehicle revenues are highly correlated with new and used vehicle retail sales and the associated trade in volume 
wholesale revenues are also significantly affected by our corporate inventory management policies  which are designed to optimize our total used vehicle inventory 
for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total wholesale vehicle units same store acquisitions and other total as reported total wholesale vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported total wholesale unit price same store total dealerships as reported lower wholesale vehicle revenues realized during were driven by a decline in wholesale unit sales coupled with a decrease in average wholesale price per unit 
the decrease in unit volume can be primarily attributed to our increased focus on retail used vehicles see used vehicles above 
the wholesale price per unit decrease can also be attributed to the merchandising process 
this process allowed us to retail vehicles that historically would have had a positive effect on our wholesale per unit price 
during  the decline in wholesale unit volume can be mainly attributed to the beginning of the implementation of our merchandising and inventory management process related to used vehicles 
we believe this improved process allowed us to retail used vehicles we historically would have disposed of through the wholesale market 
parts  service and collision repair fixed operations same store revenue from these items was as follows amounts in thousands for the year ended change change for the year ended change change parts service collision repair same store parts and service revenue consists of customer requested repairs customer pay  warranty repairs  retail parts  wholesale parts and collision repairs 
parts and service revenue is driven by the mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs  available service capacity  vehicle quality  customer loyalty and manufacturer warranty programs 
during  of our service and parts revenue was generated by warranty repairs and by customer pay repairs compared to by warranty repairs and by customer pay repairs in we believe that over time  vehicle quality will improve  but vehicle complexity will offset any revenue lost from improvement in vehicle quality 
we also believe that we have the ability  through our access to capital  to continue to add service capacity and increase revenues 
during  we added service stalls  or  to our overall stall capacity 
in addition  manufacturers continue to extend new vehicle warranty periods and have also begun to include regular maintenance items in the warranty coverage 
these factors  combined with the extended manufacturer warranties on cpo vehicles see the discussion in business business strategy certified pre owned vehicles above  should facilitate continued growth in our service and parts business 
parts revenue is driven by the mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs as prices for warranty parts are established by the manufacturer 
we believe that long term trends in retail parts sales will be affected by the same trends as discussed above for service additional capacity  customer satisfaction  etc as of december   we operated collision repair centers 
collision revenues are heavily impacted by trends in the automotive insurance industry 
the increase in collision repair revenues during versus was driven by an increase in repair order volume 
collision repair revenues remained flat during  as compared to for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total parts  service and collision repair in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported same store fixed operations revenues increased during compared to  primarily due to the performance of our import dealerships up million  or outpacing decreases in our domestic dealerships down million  or 
excluding the effect of one additional selling day in versus  our same store fixed operations revenues increased million  or 
our bmw dealerships experienced significant increases in fixed operations revenues  increasing by million  or  compared to as a result of bmw s vehicle maintenance programs and strong same store new vehicle sales 
customer pay sales at our import dealerships increased million  or 
the customer pay import increases were partially offset by decreases in warranty sales of million  or 
our mercedes dealerships experienced significant decreases in warranty sales   or  related to a change in their warranty program and a large number of recalls in the prior year 
our cadillac dealerships experienced significant decreases in fixed operations revenues  decreasing by million  or  compared to customer pay sales at our domestic dealerships decreased million  or  driven by a decrease in our cadillac stores of million  or  as compared to same store fixed operations revenues increased during compared to  primarily due to the performance of our import dealerships up million  or outpacing decreases in our domestic dealerships down million  or 
customer pay sales at our import dealerships increased million  or 
our bmw dealerships experienced significant increases in fixed operations revenues  increasing by million  or  compared to as a result of bmw s vehicle maintenance programs and strong same store new vehicle sales 
these import increases were partially offset by decreases of million  or  at our domestic dealerships 
warranty sales declines of million  or  were offset by an increase in customer pay of million  or  at our domestic stores 
our gm and cadillac dealerships  which decreased million  or  and million  or  respectively  as compared to contributed to lower domestic sales 
the declines in our gm dealerships were primarily caused by a decrease in warranty repair services and wholesale parts sales of million  or 
warranty sales at our cadillac stores experienced declines of million  or  as compared to finance  insurance and other finance  insurance and other revenues include commissions for arranging vehicle financing and insurance  sales of third party extended service contracts for vehicles and other aftermarket products 
in connection with vehicle financing  service contracts  other aftermarket products and insurance contracts  we receive commissions from the providers for originating contracts 
rate spread is another term for the commission earned by our dealerships for arranging vehicle financing for consumers 
the amount of the commission could be zero  a flat fee or an actual spread between the interest rate charged to the consumer and the interest rate provided by the direct financing source bank  credit union or manufacturers captive finance company 
we have established caps on the potential rate spread our dealerships can earn with all finance sources 
we believe the rate spread we earn for arranging financing represents value to the consumer in numerous ways  including the following lower cost  below market financing is often available only from the manufacturers captives and franchised dealers  lease financing alternatives are largely available only from manufacturers captives or other indirect lenders  customers with substandard credit frequently do not have direct access to potential sources of sub prime financing  and customers with significant negative equity in their current vehicle ie  the customer s current vehicle is worth less than the balance of their vehicle loan or lease obligation frequently are unable to pay off the loan on their current vehicle and finance the purchase or lease of a replacement new or used vehicle without the assistance of a franchised dealer 
finance  insurance and other revenues are driven by the level of new and used vehicle unit sales  manufacturer financing or leasing incentives and our f i penetration rate 
the f i penetration rate represents the percentage of vehicle sales on which we are able to originate financing or sell extended service contracts  other aftermarket products or insurance contracts 
our finance penetration rate remained relatively flat at in our extended service contract penetration rate decreased to in from in we expect our f i penetration rate to increase over time as we continue to emphasize the use of menu selling techniques 
for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total finance  insurance and other revenue in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported total f i per unit excluding fleet same store total dealerships as reported same store finance  insurance and other revenues increased during when compared to despite static retail vehicle unit sales volume 
the increase is primarily due to higher f i penetration rates 
our import dealerships reported an increase of revenues of million  or  primarily due to revenue increases in our bmw  toyota  and mercedes dealerships of million  or  million  or  and million  or  respectively 
our domestic stores also experienced increases in revenues of million  or 
the increase was led by our general motors stores of million  or 
included in finance  insurance and other revenue for the year ended december  is a million charge related to an increase in our allowance for estimated finance chargebacks 
excluding the effect of this charge  finance  insurance  and other revenue in the year ended december  would have increased 
same store finance  insurance  and other revenues increased slightly in compared to due to a increase retail unit sales volume 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributed to our import stores with an increase of million  or over our toyota and mercedes dealerships led the improvement in revenues with increases of million  or  and million  or  respectively 
our domestic stores also experienced a slight increase in revenues of million  or 
the increase was led by our general motors stores of million  or 
the domestic increase was partially offset by our ford stores  which experienced decreases of million  or 
excluding the effect of the million charge related to an increase in our allowance for estimated finance chargebacks charge for the year ended december   finance  insurance  and other revenue in the year ended december  would have increased 
gross profit and gross margins our overall gross profit and gross margin gross profit as a percentage of revenues generally vary depending on changes in our revenue mix 
although sales of new vehicles comprise the majority of our total revenues  new vehicles generally carry the lowest margin rate of any product or service we offer 
as a result  sales of new vehicles comprise a relatively small portion of total gross profits 
retail sales of used vehicles generally carry a slightly higher gross margin rate than new vehicles 
parts  service and collision repair carry a much higher gross margin rate than vehicle sales 
brand mix also has an impact on the gross margins that we realize 
historically  our import and luxury brands generally provide higher margins than our domestic brands 
as we continue to acquire more import and luxury dealerships  we would expect our gross margins to increase 
our same store revenue mix is shown in the following table for the year ended basis point change for the year ended basis point change revenues as a percentage of total revenues new vehicles used vehicles wholesale vehicles fixed operations finance  insurance and other same store for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total gross profit in thousands same store acquisitions and other total as reported the overall gross margin rates on our various revenue lines on a same store basis were as follows for the year ended basis point change for the year ended basis point change new vehicles used vehicles wholesale vehicles parts  service and collision repair finance and insurance overall gross margin the basis point decrease in the new vehicle gross margin can be attributed to weakening economic and market conditions 
the basis points decrease in used vehicle gross margin in is also the result of soft market conditions and the result of the continuing shift in our dealership mix towards more luxury and import dealerships which tend to have lower gross margin rates for used vehicles than domestic brands 
our luxury dealerships posted the largest increase in fixed operations gross margin percentages  increasing by basis points in this increase is primarily the result of a shift toward a higher proportion of sales resulting from customer pay transactions and away from warranty transactions 
our same store gross margin percentage was relatively flat in  when compared to gross margin improvements experienced in fixed operations were offset by declines in both the used and wholesale vehicle gross margin percentages 
our toyota dealerships posted the most significant increase in fixed operations gross margin percentage among our import dealerships  improving by basis points 
in addition  the majority of our domestic dealerships contributed to the fixed operations increase 
specifically  our gm excluding cadillac  ford and cadillac dealerships experienced fixed operations margin increases of basis points  basis points and basis points  respectively  when compared to selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised of four major groups compensation expense  advertising expense  rent and rent related expense  and other expense 
compensation expense primarily relates to dealership personnel who are paid a commission or a modest salary plus commission which typically vary depending on gross profits realized and support personnel who are paid a fixed salary 
due to the salary component for certain dealership and corporate personnel  gross profits and compensation expense are not correlated 
advertising expense and other expenses vary based on the level of actual or anticipated business activity and number of dealerships owned 
rent and rent related expense typically varies with the number of dealerships owned  investments made for facility improvements and interest rates 
although not completely correlated  we believe the best way to measure sg a expenses is as a percentage of gross profit 
compared to total sg a expenses increased million  or  in compared to as a percentage of gross profit  reported sg a expenses decreased by basis points  from in to in total sg a expenses in include charges totaling million and primarily relate to asset impairments  lease exit charges and legal charges 
absent these charges  and others that affected gross profit in the amount of million  sg a expenses as a percentage of gross profit in would have been for the year ended december  the basis point decrease in the ratio compared to the adjusted ratio is primarily attributed to higher gross profit dollars in and reductions in employee compensation costs slightly offset by higher rent expenses 
in  total reported compensation expense increased by million  or  when compared to as a percentage of gross profit  total compensation expense improved by basis points to in from in the favorable decrease as a percentage of gross profit was partially the result of revenue and gross profit mix shifting more toward fixed operations where the percentage of compensation related to gross profit is typically lower than other revenue categories 
absent the charges discussed above  compensation expense as a percentage of gross profit would have been in advertising expense increased million  or  in  as compared to as a percentage of gross profit  advertising expense increased by basis points to in from in advertising costs are unfavorable versus prior year due to lower rebates and credits received and higher internet advertising expenses 
absent the charges discussed above  advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit would have been in rent and rent related expenses increased million  or  in  compared to acquisitions contributed million of the overall increase 
as a percentage of gross profit  rent and rent related expenses increased by basis points to in from in in  we recorded a charge of million related to lease exit expenses 
absent this charge  and others that affected gross profit in the second quarter of in the amount of million  rent and rent related expenses as a percentage of gross profit would have been in overall rent and rent related expense increased basis points compared to the adjusted ratio due to rent increases  acquisitions  facilities improvements and higher maintenance costs 
other sg a expenses increased million  or  in  as compared to  due to increases in service loaner  credit card fees  delivery costs and bad debt expense 
absent the charges described above  other sg a expenses as a percentage of gross profit in would have increased basis points in  from in to in compared to in  total sg a expenses increased million  or  compared to as a percentage of gross profit  reported sg a expense increased by basis points  from in to in these increases  both the dollar increase and the increase as a percentage of gross profits  can be attributed to current year acquisitions  charges recorded during discussed above  and the effect of a million favorable legal settlement in acquisitions in contributed million to the year over year dollar increase 
absent the charges discussed above  sg a expenses as a percentage of gross profit in would have decreased by basis points from in to in total reported compensation expense increased million  or  in  as compared to due to acquisitions and higher gross profit levels 
however  as a percentage of gross profit  total compensation expense improved by basis points to in from in absent the charges discussed above  compensation expense as a percentage of gross profit would have improved basis points to in compared to in in  advertising expense increased million  or  improving by basis points as a percentage of gross profit when compared to approximately million of the increase in was related to acquisitions and the remaining increase is attributed to our targeted approach to allocate advertising dollars to certain brands in key markets 
absent the charges discussed above  advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit would have improved by basis points to compared to in in  rent and rent related expenses increased million  or  as compared to as a percentage of gross profit  rent and rent related expenses increased by basis points to in from in acquisitions contributed million to the increase in compared to we also experienced rent increases as a result of the completion of facility improvement projects and the resulting sale leaseback of these facilities  the effect of rising interest rates on our variable rate leases and the establishment of lease exit accruals 
absent the charges discussed above  rent and rent related expenses as a percentage of gross profit would have increased basis points to in compared to in other sg a expenses increased million  or  in  as compared to acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the remaining increase is primarily attributed to higher service loaner expense  data processing  legal expenses and impairment charges 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense increased million  or  in compared to this increase was due primarily to an million increase in gross property and equipment related to continuing operations  excluding land and construction in progress 
the increase in depreciable property was due to dealership acquisitions  facility projects on existing dealerships and the result of our strategy to own more of our dealership properties 
depreciation expense increased million  or  in compared to this increase was due primarily to a million increase in gross property and equipment related to continuing operations  excluding land and construction in progress  as well as an adjustment to depreciation expense of million which was recorded in the second quarter of this adjustment was related to the reclassification of certain assets from other current assets construction in progress to depreciable property and equipment based on strategic capital decisions which resulted in decisions not to sell these assets 
interest expense  floor plan interest expense  floor plan for new vehicles increased million  or  in compared to the average new vehicle floor plan interest rate related to new vehicles incurred by continuing dealerships was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   which increased interest expense by approximately million 
in addition  during the average floor plan balance for new vehicles increased by million  resulting in an increase in expense of approximately million 
approximately million of the increase in the average floor plan balance for new vehicles was due to additional dealerships we acquired in the average floor plan balance for new vehicles also increased due to an increase in the average price of vehicles due to general trends in the industry and our continued focus on luxury vehicles 
interest expense  floor plan for used vehicles increased million  or  in compared to the increase was due primarily to an increase in the average floor plan balance for used vehicles of million 
interest expense  floor plan for new vehicles increased million  or  in compared to the average floor plan interest rate for new vehicles incurred by continuing dealerships was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   which increased interest expense by approximately million 
in addition to this  during the average floor plan balance for new vehicles increased million which resulted in an increase in expense of approximately million 
approximately million of the increase in the average new vehicle floor plan balance was due to additional dealerships we acquired in interest expense  floor plan for used vehicles increased expense in compared to by million 
the floor plan interest expense associated with used vehicles was the result of borrowings under the used vehicle floor plan sub facility see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the average balance of the used vehicle floor plan sub facility was million in and bore an interest rate of between and 
our floor plan expenses related to new vehicles are partially offset by amounts received from manufacturers in the form of floor plan assistance 
these payments are credited against our cost of sales upon the sale of the vehicle 
for franchises classified as continuing operations  our floor plan interest expense exceeded the amounts we recognized in our consolidated income statements from floor plan assistance by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as we continue to adjust our portfolio of brands to more luxury and import franchises  we expect the difference between floor plan interest expense incurred and floor plan assistance received to widen as import and luxury manufacturers provide a smaller level of floor plan assistance than domestic manufacturers 
interest expense  other  net during  we entered into interest rate swap agreements the fixed swaps to effectively convert a portion of our libor based variable rate debt to a fixed rate  in order to reduce our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates 
the fixed swaps have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and  as a result  changes in the fair value of the fixed swaps will be recorded in other comprehensive loss income  net of related income taxes in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity

in order to reduce our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates  we had an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert a portion of our libor based variable rate debt to a fixed rate which matured on june  and had a notional principal of million

in the second quarter of  we canceled all of the old variable swaps 
the old variable swaps had a collective mark to market of million at cancellation 
in connection with this cancellation  we entered into five separate new interest rate swaps with identical terms to the old variable swaps except that we pay a variable rate equal to the fixed six month libor rate which will be fixed on february and august of each year plus a spread ranging from to with a weighted average spread of collectively  the new variable swaps

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations was in  in and in changes in the effective tax rate between years were primarily the result of the distribution of taxable income between states 
we expect the effective tax rate in future periods to fall within a range of to 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to finance acquisitions and fund debt service and working capital requirements 
we rely on cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and offerings of debt and equity securities to meet these requirements 
because the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries  the majority of our cash flows from operations are generated by these subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flows and ability to service debt depends to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries and their ability to provide us with cash based on their ability to generate cash 
uncertainties in the economic environment may therefore affect our overall liquidity 
a significant portion of our cash flow is used to fund dealership acquisitions 
following is a summary of acquisition activity in recent years year of acquisition subsequent year revenues cash portion of purchase price net of cash acquired in millions a a revenues are estimated we believe it prudent over time to maintain our long term debt to total capital ratio  net of cash and cash equivalents the debt to capital ratio at between and 
at december   our debt to capital ratio was 
the increase of our debt to capital ratio in the current year from in the prior year is primarily due to borrowings related to current year acquisitions  stock repurchases and the strategic decision to own mortgaged dealership properties rather than enter into long term operating leases 
without the effect of the new mortgages entered into in discussed below  our debt to capital ratio at december  would have been 
depending on the timing of dealership acquisitions  our debt to capital ratio may fall outside our targeted range 
our long term debt structure consists of the credit facility due in and various senior subordinated notes due or redeemable in   and  notes payable to a finance company and mortgage notes 
these are discussed in more detail below 
we believe the combination of cash flows from operations  floor plan facilities  the availability under our credit facility approximately million was available under the revolving credit sub facility at december  and our ability to raise funds in the public capital markets are sufficient to fund both our working capital needs and the targeted acquisition level discussed above 
long term debt and credit facilities credit facility on february   we entered into a new four year syndicated credit facility the credit facility with financial institutions  including three manufacturer affiliated finance companies  providing for up to billion in revolving credit and floor plan financing 
the credit facility replaces the revolving credit facility  as amended  which was terminated february  and a portion of our existing floor plan financing arrangements 
the credit facility has a borrowing limit of billion  which may be expanded up to billion in total credit availability upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
under the terms of the credit facility  up to million is available for new vehicle inventory floor plan financing the new vehicle floor plan sub facility  up to million is available for used vehicle inventory floor plan financing the used vehicle floor plan sub facility and up to million is available for working capital and general corporate purposes the revolving credit sub facility 
the amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit sub facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the aggregate face amount of any outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit sub facility 
the revolving credit sub facility matures on february  the new vehicle floor plan sub facility and the used vehicle floor plan sub facility mature on the earlier of february  or upon demand by the administrative agent at the request of more than of the lenders under those facilities 
at december   our revolving credit sub facility had a borrowing limit of million  subject to a borrowing base calculated on the basis of our receivables  inventory and equipment and a pledge of certain additional collateral by one of our affiliates the borrowing base was approximately million at december  
the amount available to be borrowed under our revolving credit sub facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative face amount of outstanding letters of credit 
at december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding and million of borrowing availability 
the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit sub facility bear interest at a specified percentage above libor according to a performance based pricing grid determined by our total senior secured debt to ebitda ratio as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter 
the range of the performance based pricing grid is from above libor to above libor 
the weighted average rate of the revolving credit sub facility during the year ended december  and was and  respectively 
in addition  there is a quarterly commitment fee payable by us on the unused portion of the revolving credit sub facility according to a performance based pricing grid determined by our total senior secured debt to ebitda ratio as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter 
the range of the performance based pricing grid for the quarterly commitment fee is to on the unused portion of the revolving credit sub facility 
the amounts outstanding under the new vehicle floor plan sub facility bear interest at above libor 
the amounts outstanding under the used vehicle floor plan sub facility bear interest at above libor 
in addition  there are quarterly commitment fees of payable by us on the unused portion of both the new vehicle floor plan sub facility and the used vehicle floor plan sub facility 
under the terms of collateral documents entered into with the lenders under the credit facility  outstanding balances under the credit facility are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and the assets of substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries  which domestic subsidiaries also guarantee our obligations under the credit facility  and the pledge of certain additional collateral by one of our affiliates 
the collateral for the credit facility also includes the pledge of the stock or equity interests of our dealership franchise subsidiaries  except where such a pledge is prohibited by the applicable vehicle manufacturer 
we agreed under the credit facility not to pledge any assets to any third party  subject to certain stated exceptions  including floor plan financing arrangements 
in addition  the credit facility contains certain negative covenants  including covenants which could restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends  capital expenditures and material dispositions of assets as well as other customary covenants and default provisions 
specifically  the credit facility permits cash dividends on our class a and class b common stock so long as no event of default or unmatured default as defined in the credit facility has occurred and is continuing and provided that  after giving effect to the payment of a dividend  we remain in compliance with other terms and conditions of the credit facility 
the credit facility contains events of default  including cross defaults to other material indebtedness  change of control events and events of default customary for syndicated commercial credit facilities 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding amounts under the credit facility 
on february   in conjunction with the entrance into the credit facility  we and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries entered into collateral documents with the lenders  pursuant to which we and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries granted a security interest in substantially all their assets to secure our obligations under the credit facility  including a pledge of the stock or equity interests of our dealership franchise subsidiaries except where such a pledge is prohibited by the applicable vehicle manufacturer 
this grant of security interests replaces the grant under the revolving credit facility  as amended 
revolving credit facility  as amended prior to entering into the credit facility  we utilized the revolving credit facility  as amended 
this facility was with ford credit  daimlerchrysler financial  toyota financial  bank of america  jp morgan chase bank and merrill lynch and had a borrowing limit of million  subject to a borrowing base calculated on the basis of receivables  inventory and equipment and a pledge of certain additional collateral by one of our affiliates 
the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility bore interest at percentage points above libor 
the revolving credit facility included an annual commitment fee equal to of the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
senior subordinated notes in august  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of notes 
in november  we issued an additional million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
this million issuance contains the same provisions and terms as the million issuance 
the notes are unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness  mature on august  and are redeemable at our option after august  the redemption premiums for the twelve month periods beginning august of the years  and are  and  respectively 
in addition  up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes may be redeemed on or before august  with net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings 
our obligations under the notes are guaranteed by our operating domestic subsidiaries 
we have five separate interest rate swaps totaling million to effectively convert a portion of our fixed rate debt under the notes to a libor based variable rate debt 
see note to our consolidated financial statements and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
if the standard poor s or moody s investor services rating on our notes drops to b or b  respectively  or is withdrawn  the counterparty for million of the total interest rate swap notional value of million has the option to terminate their interest rate swaps with us 
if this counterparty terminates these options  the mark to market value of these interest rate swaps must be paid by either us or the counterparty 
further  if the counterparty terminates  it is likely that we will be required to pay the mark to market value of these interest rate swaps 
additionally  if such a termination occurs  the fair value of million of our notes will no longer be hedged 
convertible senior subordinated notes in may  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes convertibles with net proceeds  before expenses  of approximately million 
the convertibles are unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness  mature on may  and are redeemable at our option after may  the redemption premiums for the twelve month periods beginning may of the years   and are   and  respectively 
our obligations under the convertibles are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries 
the convertibles are convertible into shares of class a common stock  at the option of the holder  based on certain conditions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding these conversion conditions 
also see off balance sheet arrangements subsequent heading also within this item for a discussion regarding the off balance sheet aspects of this financing 
none of the conversion features on the convertibles were triggered in and none of the convertibles were redeemed in in november and december  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes convertibles with net proceeds  before expenses  of approximately million 
the convertibles bear interest at an annual rate of until november  and thereafter 
the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility  as amended  and to pay the net cost of convertible note hedge and warrant transactions 
the convertibles are unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness  mature on november  and are redeemable on or after october  our obligations under the convertibles are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries 
holders of the convertibles may convert them into cash and shares of our class a common stock based on certain conditions 
upon conversion of the convertibles  we will be required to deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of the convertibles being converted or our total conversion obligation 
if our total conversion obligation exceeds the aggregate principal amount of the convertibles being converted  we will deliver shares of our class a common stock to the extent of the excess amount  if any 
we used million of the net proceeds from the sale of the convertibles to pay the net cost of convertible note hedge and warrant transactions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding these conversion conditions 
also see off balance sheet arrangements subsequent heading also within this item for a discussion regarding the off balance sheet aspects of this financing and the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions 
none of the conversion features on the convertibles were triggered in notes payable to a finance company three notes payable totaling million in aggregate principal were assumed with the purchase of certain dealerships during the second quarter of the assumed notes 
the assumed notes bear interest rates from to with a weighted average of  have a combined monthly principal and interest payment of million  mature november  through september  and are collateralized by letters of credit 
we recorded the assumed notes at fair value using an interest rate of 
the interest rate used to calculate the fair value was based on a quoted market price for notes with similar terms as of the date of assumption 
as a result of calculating the fair value  a premium of million was recorded that will be amortized over the lives of the assumed notes 
although the assumed notes allow for prepayment  the penalties and fees are disproportionately burdensome relative to the assumed notes principal balance 
therefore  we do not currently intend to prepay the assumed notes 
mortgage notes during  we obtained mortgage financing totaling million in aggregate  on four of our dealership properties 
these mortgage notes require monthly payments of principal and interest through maturity and are secured by the underlying properties 
maturity dates range between july and november the weighted average interest rate was at december  proceeds received were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit sub facility 
floor plan facilities we finance all of our new and certain of our used vehicle inventory through standardized floor plan facilities 
these floor plan facilities bear interest at variable rates based on libor and prime 
the weighted average interest rate for our floor plan facilities was for and for our floor plan interest expense is partially offset by amounts received from manufacturers  in the form of floor plan assistance 
floor plan assistance received is capitalized in inventory and charged against cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold 
in  we recognized approximately million in manufacturer assistance 
interest payments under each of our floor plan facilities are due monthly and we are generally not required to make principal repayments prior to the sale of the vehicles 
prior to february   we engaged in financing our new vehicle inventory with daimlerchrysler financial company  llc daimlerchrysler financial  ford motor credit company ford credit  general motors acceptance corporation gmac  toyota financial services toyota financial  bank of america and jp morgan chase bank 
on february  and shortly thereafter  we also entered into or renewed separate floor plan credit arrangements with daimlerchrysler services north america llc  ford motor credit company  general motors acceptance corporation and bmw financial services na  llc 
these separate floor plan credit facilities provide a total of approximately million of availability to finance new vehicle inventory purchased from the respective manufacturer affiliates of these captive finance companies and million of availability to finance used vehicle inventory 
each of these separate floor plan facilities bear interest at variable rates based on prime and libor 
our obligation under each of these separate floor plan facilities are secured  or will be secured  by liens on all of the new vehicle inventory financed under the respective floor plan credit facility  as well as the proceeds from the sale of such vehicles  and certain other collateral 
covenants and default provisions noncompliance with covenants  including a failure to make any payment when due  under our credit facility  floor plan facilities  notes  convertibles and convertibles collectively  our material debt agreements could result in a default and an acceleration of our repayment obligation under our credit facility 
a default under our credit facility would constitute a default under our floor plan facilities and could entitle these lenders to accelerate our repayment obligations under the one or more of the floor plan facilities 
a default under our credit facility and one or more floor plan facilities would not result in a default under our notes  convertibles or convertibles unless our repayment obligations under the credit facility and or one or more of the floor plan facilities were accelerated 
an acceleration of our repayment obligation under any of our material debt agreements could result in an acceleration of our repayment obligations under our other material debt agreements 
we expect to be in compliance with the covenants for all of our long term debt agreements for the foreseeable future 
we were in compliance with all of the restrictive and financial covenants on all of our floor plan and long term debt facilities required to be submitted as of and for the period ended december  the credit facility includes the following financial covenants covenant required consolidated liquidity ratio consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio consolidated total senior secured debt to ebitda ratio acquisitions and dispositions during  we acquired ten franchises for a combined purchase price of million in cash  net of cash acquired 
the cash utilized for these acquisitions was financed by cash generated from our existing operations and by borrowings under our credit facility 
during  we disposed of twelve franchises 
these disposals generated cash of million  which includes million related to the sale of the remaining assets of cornerstone acceptance corporation 
sale leaseback and mortgage transactions in an effort to generate additional cash flow  historically we sought to minimize the ownership of real property 
as a result  facilities either constructed by us or obtained in acquisitions were sold to third parties in sale leaseback transactions 
the resulting leases generally have initial terms of years and include a series of five year renewal options 
we have no continuing obligations under these arrangements other than lease payments 
in  we sold million in dealership property and equipment in sale leaseback transactions 
there were no material gains or losses on these sales 
in  we began to adjust our strategy on ownership of dealership properties and began to mortgage properties we own rather than generate capital by entering into sale leaseback transactions 
we expect this trend to continue in the future  thereby reducing the frequency of future sale leaseback transactions 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures include the construction of new dealerships and collision repair centers  building improvements and equipment purchased for use in our dealerships 
capital expenditures in were approximately million 
as of december   commitments for facilities construction projects totaled approximately million 
stock repurchase program our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase shares of our class a common stock or redeem securities convertible into class a common stock 
at the beginning of  our remaining repurchase authorization was approximately million 
during  we received an additional million stock repurchase authorization from our board of directors 
during  we repurchased  shares for approximately million 
as of december   we had million remaining under our board authorization 
dividends our board of directors approved four quarterly cash dividends totaling per share during effective february   our board of directors approved a dividend of per share for shareholders of record on march  that will be paid on april  we intend to pay dividends in the future based on available cash flows  covenant compliance and other factors 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of restrictions on the payment of dividends 
cash flows cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  since the majority of our inventories are financed through floor plan notes payable and a significant portion of our receivables represent contracts in transit which are typically funded within ten days of the sale of the vehicle  we are not required to make significant investments in working capital that would negatively impact our operating cash flows 
we arrange our inventory floor plan financing through both manufacturer captive finance companies and commercial banks 
generally  our floor plan financed with manufacturer captives is recorded as trade floor plan liabilities with the resulting change being reflected as an operating cash flow 
our dealerships that obtain floor plan financing from commercial banks record their obligation as non trade floor plan liabilities with the resulting change being reflected as a financing cash flow 
due to the presentation differences for changes in trade floor plan and non trade floor plan  in the statement of cash flows  decisions made by us to move dealership floor plan financing arrangements from one finance source to another may cause significant variations in operating and financing cash flows without affecting our overall liquidity  working capital  or cash flow 
accordingly  if all changes in floor plan notes payable were classified as an operating activity for the years ended december   and the adjusted net cash provided by operating activities would be million  million and million  respectively 
during the third quarter of  we generated cash of approximately million from the sale of a portion of cornerstone s notes receivable to a third party 
this inflow of cash is included in cash flows from operating activities  change in receivables  in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  this transaction resulted in no material gains or losses 
the proceeds from the sale were used to pay down our credit facility 
cornerstone s outstanding notes receivable at december  were million  net of an allowance for credit losses of million 
during the third quarter of  we sold the remaining assets of cornerstone and the proceeds are included in cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities during  and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the majority of the investing activities cash outflow is related to dealership acquisitions and capital expenditures on construction in progress projects partially offset by proceeds received from dealership dispositions and the sales of property and equipment 
purchases of businesses  net of cash acquired  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts include repayments of seller s floor plan notes payable of million  million and million  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flow provided by financing activities is comprised mostly of the increases of floor plan notes payable non trade  borrowings on our revolving credit facilities and proceeds from long term debt partially offset by repayments on our revolving credit facilities 
during the years ended december  and  proceeds from long term debt amounted to million and million  respectively 
the proceeds from long term debt were obtained from mortgage financing on four dealership properties 
proceeds received were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit sub facility 
the proceeds from long term debt were generated by the issuance of our convertibles  the net proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under our revolving facility and to pay the net cost of convertible note hedge and warrant transactions 
cash flows from discontinued operations our consolidated statement of cash flows includes both continuing and discontinued operations 
net cash used in operating activities associated with discontinued operations for the year ended december  was approximately million and was substantially comprised of changes in assets and liabilities that relate to dealership operations 
in our consolidated statement of cash flows  cash flows from investing activities includes the line item proceeds from sale of franchises which is entirely related to discontinued operations 
with the exception of proceeds from sale of franchises in the amount of million and net payments on notes payable floor plan non trade in the amount of million  cash flows from investing and financing activities contain an immaterial amount of cash flows from discontinued operations 
since discontinued operations typically contain unprofitable franchises  the absence of these cash flows would generally increase consolidated cash flows from operations 
guarantees and indemnifications in connection with the operation and disposition of dealership franchises  we have entered into various guarantees and indemnifications 
also  when we sell dealership franchises  we attempt to assign any related leases to the buyer of the franchise to eliminate any future liability 
however  if we are unable to assign the related leases to the buyer  we will attempt to sublease the leased properties to the buyer at a rate equal to the terms of the original leases 
in the event we are unable to sublease the properties to the buyer with terms at least equal to our lease  we may be required to record lease exit accruals 
at december   our future gross minimum lease payments related to properties subleased to buyers of sold franchises totaled approximately million 
future sublease payments expected to be received related to these lease payments were million at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding lease accruals  guarantees and indemnifications 
also see off balance sheet arrangements subsequent heading also within this item for a discussion regarding the off balance sheet aspects of these guarantees and indemnifications 
future liquidity outlook our future contractual obligations are as follows amounts in thousands thereafter total floor plan facilities long term debt estimated interest payments on floor plan facilities estimated interest payments on long term debt operating leases construction contracts other purchase obligations acquisition purchase commitments fin liability total floor plan facilities includes amounts classified as liabilities associated with assets held for sale

we believe our best source of liquidity for future growth remains cash flows generated from operations combined with our availability of borrowings under our floor plan facilities or any replacements thereof  our credit facility and our ability to raise funds in the public capital markets 
though uncertainties in the economic environment may affect our ability to generate cash from operations  we expect to generate more than sufficient cash flow to fund our debt service and working capital requirements and any seasonal operating requirements  including our currently anticipated internal growth for our existing businesses  for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
once these needs are met  we may use remaining cash flow to support our acquisition strategy or repurchase shares of our class a common stock or publicly traded debt securities  as market conditions warrant 
seasonality our operations are subject to seasonal variations 
the first and fourth quarters generally contribute less operating profits than the second and third quarters 
weather conditions  the timing of manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers cause seasonality in  and may adversely affect our profitability and new vehicle demand 
parts and service demand remains more stable throughout the year 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees and indemnifications in connection with the operation and disposition of dealership franchises  we have entered into various guarantees and indemnifications 
we expect the aggregate amount of the obligations we guarantee to increase as we dispose of additional franchises 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding these guarantees and indemnifications 
past performance under these guarantees and indemnifications and their estimated fair value has been immaterial to our liquidity and capital resources 
although we seek to mitigate our exposure in connection with these matters  these guarantees and indemnifications  including environmental exposures and the financial performance of lease assignees and sub lessees  cannot be predicted with certainty 
an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our variable rate floor plan facilities  revolving credit facility borrowings and other variable rate notes expose us to risks caused by fluctuations in the applicable interest rates 
the total outstanding balance of such variable instruments after considering the effect of our interest rate swaps see below was approximately million at december  and approximately  million at december  a change of basis points in the underlying interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately million in and approximately million in of the total change in interest expense  approximately million in and approximately million in would have resulted from the floor plan facilities 
during the last half of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements see table below which lessen the effect of changes in interest rates on our results of operations 
as these swaps were only in place for a portion of the year  only a portion of the annual effect of these swaps was considered in the calculation of the million amount above 
in addition to our variable rate debt  approximately of our dealership facilities have monthly lease payments that fluctuate based on libor interest rates 
a change in interest rates of basis points would have had an estimated impact on rent expense of approximately million in in order to reduce our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates  we had an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert a portion of our libor based variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
the swap matured june  and had a notional principal of million 
under the terms of the swap  we received interest payments on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one month libor rate  adjusted monthly  and made interest payments at a fixed rate of we have five separate interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts totaling million collectively  the new variable swaps to effectively convert a portion of our fixed rate debt under the notes to a libor based variable rate debt 
under the new variable swaps  we receive on the respective notional amounts and pay interest payments on the respective notional amounts at a rate equal to the six month libor which is fixed on february and august of each year plus a spread ranging from to with a weighted average spread of 
the new variable swaps expire on august  during  we entered into interest rate swap agreements collectively  the fixed swaps to effectively convert a portion of its libor based variable rate debt to a fixed rate

although we purchase our inventories in us dollars  our business is subject to foreign exchange rate risk which may influence automobile manufacturers ability to provide their products at competitive prices in the united states 
to the extent that we cannot recapture this volatility in prices charged to customers or if this volatility negatively impacts consumer demand for our products  this volatility could adversely affect our future operating results
