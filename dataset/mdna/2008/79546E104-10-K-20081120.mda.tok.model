please see industry and business trends economic conditions and other significant items below 
overview description of business we are the largest distributor of professional beauty supplies in the us based on store count 
we operate primarily through two business units  sally beauty supply and bsg 
through sally beauty supply and bsg which operates stores under the cosmoprof service mark  we operated a multi channel platform of  stores and supplied franchised stores in north america as well as selected european countries and japan  as of september  within bsg  we also have one of the largest networks of professional distributor sales consultants in north america  with over  professional distributor sales consultants who sell directly to salons and salon professionals 
we provide our customers with a wide variety of leading third party branded and exclusive label professional beauty supplies  including hair care products  styling appliances  skin and nail care products and other beauty items 
sally beauty supply stores target retail consumers and salon professionals  while bsg exclusively targets salons and salon professionals 
for the year ended september   our net sales and operating earnings were  million and million  respectively 
we believe sally beauty supply is the largest open line distributor of professional beauty supplies in the us based on store count 
as of september   sally beauty supply operated  company operated retail stores and supplied franchised stores acquired in the salon services acquisition which is discussed in greater detail below under recent acquisitions   of which are located in the us with the remainder in the united kingdom and certain other countries in europe  canada  puerto rico  mexico and japan 
sally beauty supply stores average  square feet and are primarily located in strip shopping centers 
the product selection in sally beauty supply stores ranges between  and  skus of beauty products and includes products for hair care  skin and nail care  beauty sundries and electrical appliances targeting retail consumers and salon professionals 
sally beauty supply stores carry leading third party brands such as clairol  revlon and conair  as well as an extensive selection of exclusive label merchandise 
for the year ended september   sally beauty supply s net sales and segment operating profit were  million and million  respectively  representing and of our consolidated net sales and operating profit before unallocated corporate expenses  respectively 
we believe bsg is the largest full service distributor of professional beauty supplies in the us as of september   bsg had company operated stores  supplied franchised stores and had a sales force of over  professional distributor sales consultants selling exclusively to salons and salon professionals in substantially all states in the us and in portions of canada  mexico and certain european countries 
bsg stores average  square feet and are primarily located in secondary strip shopping centers 
through bsg s large store base and sales force  bsg is able to access a significant portion of the highly fragmented us salon channel 
the product selection in bsg stores  ranging between  and  skus of beauty products  includes hair care and color  skin and nail care  beauty sundries and 
table of contents electrical appliances  targeting salons and salon professionals 
bsg carries leading professional beauty product brands  intended for use in salons and for resale by the salon to consumers 
certain bsg products are sold under exclusive distribution agreements with suppliers  whereby bsg is designated as the sole distributor for a product line within certain geographic territories 
for the year ended september   bsg s net sales and segment operating profit were million and million  respectively  representing and of our consolidated net sales and operating profit before unallocated corporate expenses  respectively 
industry and business trends we operate within the large and growing us professional beauty supply industry 
potential growth in the industry is expected to be driven by increases in hair color  hair loss prevention and hair styling products  offset by lower sales of electrical products during periods of prolonged economic slowdown 
we believe the following key industry and business trends and characteristics will influence our business and our financial results going forward high level of customer fragmentation 
the us salon channel is highly fragmented with over  salons 
given the fragmented and small scale nature of the salon industry  we believe that salon operators will continue to depend on full service exclusive distributors and open line channels for a majority of their beauty supply purchases 
growth in booth renting and frequent stocking needs 
salon professionals primarily rely on just in time inventory due to capital constraints and a lack of warehouse and shelf space at salons 
in addition  booth renters  who comprise a significant percentage of total us salon professionals  are often responsible for purchasing their own supplies 
historically  booth renters have significantly increased as a percentage of total salon professionals and we expect this trend to continue 
given their smaller individual purchases and relative lack of financial resources  booth renters are likely to be dependent on frequent trips to professional beauty supply stores  like bsg and sally beauty supply 
these factors continue to drive demand for conveniently located professional beauty supply stores 
increasing use of exclusive label products 
we offer a broad range of private label and control label products  which we generally refer to collectively as exclusive label products 
private label products are brands for which we own or license the trademark and  in some instances  the formula 
control label products are brands that are owned by the manufacturer  but for which we have been granted sole distribution rights 
generally  our exclusive label products have higher gross margins than the leading third party branded products and we believe this area offers potential growth 
please see risk factors we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
international growth strategies 
a key element of our growth strategy depends on our ability to capitalize on growth in the international marketplace and to grow our current level of non us operations 
in may  we acquired pro duo  non us  a cash and carry retailer of both professional and retail hair products with approximately stores located in belgium  france and spain 
in february  we acquired chapelton limited  a private company based in scotland with almost stores located in the united kingdom  ireland  germany  france and spain  which we refer to as salon services 
in june  we acquired salon success  a united kingdom based distributor of professional beauty products with sales operations in the united kingdom  spain and the netherlands 
these acquisitions further our expansion plans in europe and are a significant part of sally beauty supply s international growth initiative 
we intend to continue to identify and evaluate non us acquisition targets and are actively considering expansion into south america 
our ability to grow our non us operations  integrate our new non us acquisitions and to successfully pursue additional non us acquisitions may be affected by business  legal  regulatory and economic risks 

table of contents please see risk factors we may not be able to successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete desirable acquisitions  if we acquire any businesses in the future they could prove difficult to integrate  disrupt our business or have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to conduct business in international marketplaces may be affected by legal  regulatory and economic risks 
continuing consolidation 
there is continuing consolidation among professional beauty product distributors and professional beauty product manufacturers 
we plan to continue to examine ways in which we can benefit from this trend  including reviewing opportunities to shift business from competitive distributors to the bsg network as well as seeking opportunistic value added acquisitions 
we believe that suppliers are increasingly likely to focus on larger distributors and retailers with broader scale and retail footprint 
we also believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend as well as participate in the ongoing consolidation at the distributor retail level 
however  changes often occur in our relationships with suppliers that may materially affect the net sales and operating earnings of our business segments 
consolidation among suppliers could exacerbate the effects of these relationship changes and could increase pricing pressures 
for example  as we announced in december  our largest supplier  l oreal  moved a material amount of revenue out of the bsg nationwide distribution network and into competitive regional distribution networks 
more recently  l oreal also acquired distributors competing with bsg in the southeastern and west coast of the us and a supplier that does not currently do business with bsg 
as a result  l oreal directly competes with bsg in certain geographic areas 
if l oreal acquired other distributors or suppliers that conduct significant business with bsg  we could lose related revenue 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further loss of revenue over time by bsg including within its franchise based business due to potential losses of additional l oreal related products as well as from the increased competition from l oreal affiliated distribution networks 
please see relationships with suppliers and risk factors the beauty products distribution industry is highly competitive and is consolidating  and we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
high level of competition 
sally beauty supply competes with other domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail outlets  including local and regional open line beauty supply stores  professional only beauty supply stores  salons  mass merchandisers  drug stores and supermarkets  as well as sellers on the internet and salons retailing hair care items 
bsg competes with other domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail suppliers and manufacturers selling professional beauty products directly to salons and individual salon professionals 
we also face competition from authorized and unauthorized retailers and internet sites offering professional salon only products 
the increasing availability of unauthorized professional salon products in large format retail stores such as drug stores  grocery stores and others could also have a negative impact on our business 
favorable demographic and consumer trends 
the aging baby boomer population is expected to drive future growth in professional beauty supply sales through an increase in the usage of hair color and hair loss products 
additionally  continuously changing fashion related trends that drive new hair styles are expected to result in continued demand for hair styling products 
changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends can have an impact on our financial performance 
our continued success depends in large part on our ability to anticipate  gauge and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences for beauty products 
we continuously adapt our marketing and merchandising initiatives for sally beauty supply in an effort to expand our market reach or to respond to changing consumer preferences 
for example  in fiscal year we signed an exclusive merchandising agreement in the us and canada for certain hair extension products promoting celebrity paris hilton in an attempt to enhance our appeal to a 
table of contents younger customer base in these geographic areas 
if we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the market for beauty products and changing consumer demands  our business could suffer 
economic conditions 
we appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer a broad selection of beauty products sold directly to retail consumers and salons and salon professionals 
historically  these factors have provided us with reduced exposure to downturns in economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
however  downturns in the economy  especially for an extended period of time  could adversely impact consumer demand of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services  particularly affecting our electrical products category and our full service sales business 
in addition  higher freight costs resulting from increases in the cost of fuel  especially for an extended period of time  may impact our expenses at levels that we cannot pass through to our customers 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
controlling expenses 
another important aspect of our business is our ability to control costs  especially in our bsg business segment  by right sizing the business and maximizing the efficiency of our structure 
in fiscal year  in response to the loss of l oreal related revenue discussed above  bsg s sales force was reduced and the remaining affected distributor sales consultants were offered certain compensation related incentives to stay with bsg as bsg has sought and continues to seek additional non l oreal revenue 
during fiscal year  we began implementing a two year capital spending program to consolidate warehouses and reduce administrative expenses related to bsg s distribution network optimization program 
during the fiscal year  project capital expenditures were approximately million and related expenses were approximately million  including depreciation expense 
we believe that cost savings from this program could range between million and million in fiscal year and annualized savings of million beginning in fiscal year please see risk factors we are not certain that our ongoing cost control plans will continue to be successful 
opening new stores 
our future growth strategy depends in part  on our ability to open and profitably operate new stores in existing and additional geographic areas 
the capital requirements to open a us based sally beauty supply or bsg store  excluding inventory  average approximately  and  respectively 
however  we may not be able to open all of the new stores we plan to open and any new stores we open may not be profitable  either of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
please see risk factors if we are unable to profitably open and operate new stores  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
changes to our information technology systems 
as our operations grow in both size and scope  we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our information systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 
the expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial  operational and technical resources in advance of any increase in the volume of our business  with no assurance that the volume of business will increase 
for example  in fiscal year we have upgraded our lawson financial reporting system and implemented customer relationship management  or crm  programs for our sally beauty supply stores and are currently upgrading our distribution information systems in connection with our capital spending program to consolidate warehouses  as discussed above  upgrading our as iseries servers and implementing a new point of sale system for tracking customer sales 
these and any other required upgrades to our information systems and information technology or new technology  now or in the future  will require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in completion of these projects 
there can be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades  service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded 
table of contents technology and customer issues therewith  or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our financial reporting  business  financial condition or results of operations 
please see risk factors we may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems 
relationships with suppliers 
we do not manufacture the brand name or exclusive label products we sell  and instead purchase our products from manufacturers 
we depend upon a limited number of manufacturers for a significant percentage of the products we sell  and our relationships with these suppliers change often 
please see relationships with suppliers 
relationships with suppliers most of the net sales of sally beauty supply and bsg are generated through retail stores with respect to the sally beauty supply business  and both professional only stores and professional distribution sales consultants with respect to the bsg business 
in addition  bsg has a number of franchisees located primarily in the south and southwestern portions of the us and in mexico  which buy products directly from bsg for resale in their assigned territories 
a very small percentage of sales are generated through franchisees or sub distributors primarily in europe  which also buy products directly from sally beauty supply or bsg for resale 
sally beauty supply bsg and their suppliers are dependent on each other for the distribution of beauty products 
as is typical in distribution businesses  these relationships are subject to change from time to time including the expansion or loss of distribution rights in various geographies and the addition or loss of products lines 
since we purchase products from many manufacturers on an at will basis  under contracts which can generally be terminated without cause upon days notice or less or which expire without express rights of renewal  such manufacturers could discontinue sales to us at any time or upon the expiration of the distribution period 
some of our contracts with manufacturers may be terminated by such manufacturers if we fail to meet specified minimum purchase requirements 
in such cases  we do not have contractual assurances of continued supply  pricing or access to new products and vendors may change the terms upon which they sell 
infrequently  a supplier will seek to terminate a distribution relationship through legal action 
changes in our relationships with suppliers occur often  and could positively or negatively impact our net sales and operating profits 
for example  during the second quarter of fiscal year  farouk systems  inc  or farouk systems  terminated its distribution agreement with us 
subsequently  effective july  bsg stores and professional distributor sales consultants were once again given approval to distribute farouk systems products  with an expanded distribution area 
in the first quarter of fiscal  farouk systems again terminated its distribution agreement with us except through our armstrong mccall franchisees 
in december  we announced the loss of certain l oreal distribution rights  including among other things distribution rights through our bsg distributor sales consultants and the loss of exclusive rights to distribute l oreal products in our bsg stores 
these losses have resulted in margin pressure on bsg s remaining l oreal revenues  and this pressure is currently projected to continue into fiscal year as discussed above  l oreal has entered into direct competition with bsg and there can be no assurance that there will not be further revenue losses over time at bsg due to potential losses of additional l oreal related products as well as from the increased competition from l oreal affiliated distribution networks 
bsg has entered into long term agreements with l oreal under which  as of january   bsg had non exclusive rights to distribute the same l oreal professional products in its stores that it previously had exclusive rights to distribute in its stores and through its sales consultants 
armstrong mccall retained its exclusive rights to distribute matrix professional products in its territories 
although we have focused on developing new revenue and cost management initiatives to mitigate the negative effects resulting from unfavorable changes in our supplier relationships  there can be no assurance that our efforts will continue to completely offset the loss of these or other distribution rights 

table of contents please see risk factors we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
bsg continues to expand our product line offerings including wella  sebastian and graham webb into additional geographic areas for bsg stores and distributor sales consultants 
additionally  during fiscal years and  our expansion of the bsg segment included the acquisition of certain assets  and the award of distribution rights  which allow us to distribute goldwell kms products and paul mitchell products on an incremental basis in various areas  as well as a number of other brands 
we expect to gain certain additional distribution rights over time through either further negotiations with suppliers  or by strategic acquisitions of existing distributors 
although we are focused on developing new revenue and cost management initiatives  there can be no assurance that our efforts will partially or completely offset any potential loss of distribution rights in the future 
please see risk factors we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
recent acquisitions during the fiscal year ended september   we completed several acquisitions at an aggregate cost of million  of which substantially all was allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
generally  we funded these acquisitions with cash from operations as well as borrowings under our abl facility 
on may   we acquired pro duo  a store beauty supply chain located in belgium  france and spain  for million approximately million plus incidental acquisition costs capitalized subject to certain adjustments 
this acquisition provided the sally beauty supply segment with an expanded geographic footprint in continental europe and was funded with cash from operations and borrowings on our abl facility 
we also assumed million approximately million of pre acquisition debt of pro duo in connection with the acquisition

certain of our subsidiaries financed the purchase price through a draw down of approximately million under our abl facility 
in addition  we extinguished approximately million of pre acquisition debt of salon services 
salon services  through its direct and indirect subsidiaries supplies professional hair and beauty products primarily to salon and spa operators and independent hair and beauty professionals in the united kingdom  germany  ireland and spain 
in addition  during june we acquired salon success  a united kingdom based distributor of professional beauty products in order to expand bsg s presence in the united kingdom and expand the geographic area served by bsg into other portions of europe 
this acquisition enabled bsg to enter new markets in europe  including the united kingdom  spain and the netherlands and to expand its operations in florida 
the total purchase price  as adjusted pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  was approximately million 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  additional consideration of approximately million has been paid pursuant to this agreement as of september  our separation from alberto culver our business historically constituted two operating segments within the consolidated financial statements of alberto culver

alberto culver treated the separation transactions as though they constituted a change in control for purposes of alberto culver s stock options and stock awards 
as a result  in accordance with the terms of these plans  all outstanding stock options and restricted shares of alberto culver  including those held by our employees  became fully vested upon completion of the separation transactions
