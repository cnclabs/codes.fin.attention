audit committee findings relating to stock option review in march  the board of directors of sst initiated a voluntary review of sst s historical stock option granting practices covering the time from our initial public offering in through the review was led by the chairman of the audit committee of the board of directors with the assistance of outside independent legal counsel  and began on or about march  based on the findings of the chairman  we identified a number of occasions on which we used an incorrect measurement date for financial accounting and reporting purposes 
these errors resulted primarily from our use from through mid  of certain date selection methods discussed below which resulted in grantees receiving options with stated exercise prices lower than the market price of the underlying stock on the revised measurement dates 
we ceased using such practices beginning in mid the chairman found that  beginning in mid  we improved our stock option grant processes with respect to new hire  merit and promotion grants and have generally granted and priced our stock options for new hires  merit and promotions in an objective and consistent manner since that time 
however  from through  we used incorrect measurement dates for financial accounting and reporting purposes for company wide or retention stock option grants and in various other circumstances 
the chairman s review did not identify any additional stock based compensation charges from measurement date issues subsequent to as a result of the errors we identified  in connection with filing our annual report on form k for the year ended december   we restated our historical financial statements  from through  to record million of charges related to stock based compensation and associated payroll tax expense  net of related income tax effects 
these additional stock based compensation expense charges were non cash and had no impact on our reported revenue  cash  cash equivalents or marketable securities for each of the restated periods 
for further information  please refer to note restatement of consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  overview we are a leading supplier of nor flash memory semiconductor devices for the digital consumer  networking  wireless communications and internet computing markets 
nor flash memory is a form of nonvolatile memory that allows electronic systems to retain information when the system is turned off 
nor flash memory is now used in hundreds of millions of consumer electronics and computing products annually 
we produce and sell many products based on our superflash design and manufacturing process technology 
our products are incorporated into products sold by many well known companies including apple  asustek  cambridge silicon radio  canon  compal  dell  epson  first international computer  or fic  foxconn  or honhai  fujitsu  funai  garmin  gigabyte  gn netcom  haier  hewlett packard  huawei  infineon  intel  ibm  inventec  jvc  lenovo  lexmark  lg electronics  lite on it  matsushita  or panasonic  micronas  motorola  nec  nintendo  philips  pioneer  quanta  sagem  samsung  sanyo  seagate  sony  sony ericsson  tcl  thomson  tivo  toshiba  usi  western digital  and zte 
we also produce and sell other semiconductor products including flash microcontrollers  smartcard ics and modules  rf ics and modules  nand controllers and nand controller based memory modules 
one of our key initiatives is the further development of our non memory business 
our objective is to transform sst from a pure play in flash memory to become a multi product line semiconductor company and a leading licensor of embedded flash technology 
we continue to execute on our plan to derive a significant portion of our revenue from non memory products  including embedded controllers  nand controller based modules  smartcard ics and radio frequency ics and modules 
we believe non memory products represent an area in which we have significant competitive advantages and also an area that can yield  in the long run  profitable revenue with higher asps and more stable gross margins than our memory products 
in review we are focusing our attention on executing a growth strategy that we began more than three years ago 
with the recognition that our core memory business will continue to experience average selling price pressure that would limit our revenue growth potential  we began in late investing in products and technologies that are expected to yield average selling prices  or asps  that are expected to be substantially higher than our current products 
while our memory business continues to be healthy  we believe that a strategy of diversification will allow for better growth opportunities and higher return for our shareholders 
we have invested internally and externally on new technologies designed to enhance our competitive position 
these new products include the following nandrive  a high performance  small form factor solid state drive 
nandrive contains an integrated ata controller and nand flash die in a multichip package and is used as a basic building block of storage for a wide variety of applications 
it is currently available in multiple densities up to gb with higher density gb  gb and gb in development 
to date  we have more than design wins for this product family and we expect to see its revenue gradually ramp up in the later part of all in onememory 
this is a memory subsystem that blends key benefits of nor  nand  and ram in a unified architecture which offers very high density execute in place code storage and is designed to satisfy the growing data storage needs of embedded applications 
our first commercial samples of this product are expected to be available in june  with the first product in this family expected to be released to production in the third quarter of flashmate 
a technology  jointly developed with insyde software that combines our expertise in nand flash controllers and memory subsystem design with insyde software s expertise in pc bios  system software and power management to create a complete application subsystem 
with more than million notebooks sold each year worldwide  the revenue potential for this product is favorable given that the average selling price is likely to be significantly higher than any of our current products 
we expect to tape out the flashmate design in mid and to have the first series of product samples available in the second half of melodywing  a wireless audio solution 
this product offers uncompressed  wire equivalent sound quality for use in both home theater surround sound and multi room audio broadcasting applications and allows significantly enhanced sound quality over other wireless audio products on the market 
as the design in cycle with major accounts for all of these products is at least months  we expect to see revenue from nandrive and melodywing in the second half of and with flashmate and all in onememory beginning to contribute revenue in we will continue to introduce new  value added products throughout the course of our core memory business remains robust 
for the past years  an increasing number of electronic products have been designed around microprocessors and microcontrollers and virtually all of these products incorporate some low density nor flash memory for code storage 
in some cases  the code size for each product is also increasing as consumers demand more features and functionality 
further  as the definition of low density continues to expand into  and mbit densities  the addressable market for our products grows steadily 
we believe this creates an opportunity for us and gives strong evidence that our core business will benefit from a growing market 
we are continually driving towards these increasing densities and smaller geometries through the advantages of our superflash technology 
currently  the range for low density nor is between kilobits up to sixteen megabits of memory 
we address this market with feature rich  cost effective products which allow us to support a very broad range of applications 
for applications requiring smaller memory  we offer embedded superflash technology through licensing agreements 
in our application categories  for as compared to  revenue from wireless communications increased by while revenue from of our digital consumer applications declined by  internet computing applications declined by and networking applications increased by 
outlook we expect to see a substantial decline in the first quarter of in our higher margin business as a result of seasonal weakness and the uncertainty in the us and world economies 
further  our decision to focus on high margin business opportunities as a result of our capacity shortage in expectedly resulted in the loss of market share in some of our high volume  commodity customers which we expect to affect our revenue over the next several quarters 
to alleviate some of the manufacturing capacity constraints we experienced in  we have been working with several foundries to bring up additional capacity at the and nanometer technology nodes 
as we enter  we expect the normal seasonality in the first half to bring our capacity back in line with demand 
currently  we have started a nanometer pilot production at both grace and powerchip 
by gradually converting our products from nanometer to nanometer  we expect our unit output from grace to increase by the fourth quarter of concentrations we derived  and of our net product revenues during  and  respectively  from product shipments to asia 
in addition  substantially all of our wafer suppliers and packaging and testing subcontractors are located in asia 
shipments to our top ten end customers  which exclude transactions through stocking representatives and distributors  accounted for  and of our net product revenues in  and  respectively 
no single end customer  which we define as original equipment manufacturers  or oems  original design manufacturers  or odms  contract electronic manufacturers  or cems  or end users  represented or more of our net product revenues during  and we ship products to  and have accounts receivable from  oems  odms  cems  stocking representatives  distributors  and our logistics center 
our stocking representatives  distributors and logistics center reship our products to our end customers  including oems  odms  cems and end users 
shipments  by us or our logistic center  to our top three stocking representatives for reshipment accounted for  and of our product shipments in  and  respectively 
in addition  the same three stocking representatives solicited sales  for which they received a commission  for  and of our product shipments to end users in  and  respectively 
we out source our end customer service logistics in asia to silicon professional technology ltd  or spt  which supports our customers in taiwan  china and other southeast asia countries 
spt provides forecasting  planning  warehousing  delivery  billing  collection and other logistic functions for us in these regions 
spt is a wholly owned subsidiary of one of our stocking representatives in taiwan  professional computer technology limited  or pct 
please see a description of our relationship with pct under related party transactions 
products shipped to spt are accounted for as our inventory held at our logistics center  and revenue is recognized when the products have been delivered and are considered as a sale to our end customers by spt 
for the years ended december   and  spt serviced end customer sales accounting for  and of our net product revenues recognized 
as of december   and  spt represented  and of our net accounts receivable  respectively 
our product sales are made primarily using short term cancelable purchase orders 
the quantities actually purchased by the customer  as well as shipment schedules  are frequently revised to reflect changes in the customer s needs and in our supply of products 
accordingly  our backlog of open purchase orders at any given time is not a meaningful indicator of future sales 
changes in the amount of our backlog do not necessarily reflect a corresponding change in the level of actual or potential sales

memory revenue     non memory revenue     product revenue     technology licensing    total net revenues     the following discussions are based on our reportable segments described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
memory products memory revenue decreased in from primarily due to supply constraints due to wafer shortages from our foundry sources 
these shortages led to orders that could not be fulfilled and forced us to be more selective in order acceptance 
as a result  certain revenue opportunities were lost due to our inability to produce an adequate supply of products 
while overall unit shipments increased for  average selling prices declined due to continuing competitive pricing pressures in low density markets 
memory revenue increased for from primarily due to a increase in unit shipments 
increased demand for wireless communication products and networking applications led to the results 
average selling prices also increased 
non memory products non memory revenue decreased substantially for from supply constraints  a decrease in units shipped and a decrease in average selling prices all led to the steep decline 
the decline was led by nand controller shipments which declined for we expect non memory revenue to be relatively flat until we begin volume shipment of recently introduced products in the second half of decreases of average selling prices in non memory products in were mainly due to pricing pressures on smartcard ics 
non memory revenue increased for from primarily due to a increase in unit shipments 
the increase in unit shipments was somewhat offset by a decrease in average selling prices due to product mix and price erosion  primarily on smartcard ics 
technology licensing revenue technology license revenue includes primarily a combination of up front fees and royalties 
technology licensing revenue for increased over primarily due to increased royalties from our licensees 
although there will be some fluctuations in royalty revenue on a quarterly basis  we expect technology license revenue to grow in technology licensing revenue remained relatively flat for from as a result of lower upfront fees as well as some upward fluctuation in royalties

as a result  we concentrated on sales of higher margin products with just a increase in units shipped over overall memory gross margins also rose as a result of shipping more profitable products despite a decrease in average selling prices 
gross profit for memory products increased million for compared to largely due to a increase in the number of units shipped  the continued transition to smaller geometries and lower write downs of inventory in as compared to non memory products gross profit for non memory products declined nearly for nand controller shipments declined by million units leading to the majority decline in gross profit 
additionally  supply constraints led to a overall decrease in unit shipments coupled with continuing pricing pressures on smartcards contributed to a decrease in average selling prices as well as a decrease in our overall non memory gross margins 
gross profit for non memory products increased million in compared to as total unit shipments increased  led by our rf ic products 
this was partially offset by a decline in average selling prices which was largely a result of changes in product mix 
we expect some revenue fluctuation in non memory business as we expect to grow and diversify our revenue and customer base

other operating expenses    percent of revenue during  the market price of our common stock declined to the point where our net assets exceeded out total market capitalization and concluded that the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeded its implied fair value 
accordingly  we recorded an million impairment charge during the fourth quarter of in addition  we reviewed the carrying value of our long lived assets and determined that the estimated future cash flows were insufficient to recover the carrying value of certain long lived assets 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of  to property and equipment and  to intangible assets in order to write these assets down to their estimated fair market value 
during  we conducted a voluntary independent review of our historical stock option granting practices 
we incurred million in expenses during  which included external legal  tax  accounting  and other professional services

equity investments in the first quarter of  we determined that our investment in nanotech  inc had become impaired as nanotech defaulted on its loan payments to certain of its business partners and began preparations to liquidate itself 
as a result  we wrote our million investment down to zero as well as an outstanding loan of  after discussions with management of grace semiconductor manufacturing corporation gsmc during the fourth quarter of  we undertook a review of the carrying value of this investment in order to determine whether it had suffered an other than temporary decline in value 
as part of the review we considered the historical performance of the business  expectations of future operating results and other factors relevant to determining the estimated fair value of our equity holdings 
based on this review  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to write down the investment to its estimated fair value as of december  further discussions were held with gsmc management during the third quarter of which required us to perform a review of the investment in order to determine whether it had suffered an additional impairment 
based on changes in gsmc s operating plans and the impact on future expectations for the business  we determined that the investment had suffered a further decline in value  and accordingly recorded an additional impairment charge of million in the third quarter of this charge was recorded in order to write down the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value as of september  there were no triggering events noted during the fourth quarter of that required an additional impairment review 
during  we noted that our investee  eonex  had suffered significant declines in net revenue during fiscal continued to decline 
in the second quarter of  eonex exhausted its on hand cash and relied on short term borrowings to sustain operations while additional liquidity sources were being pursued 
in the fourth quarter of  we noted that eonex had failed to secure additional financing and thus we concluded that our investment in eonex was impaired 
given the lack of funds and no immediate source for additional financing  we wrote off our investment in the fourth quarter of and recorded an impairment charge for of our million carrying value of eonex 
during the fourth quarter of  we wrote down one of our investments  advanced chip engineering technology  or acet  since acet issued a secondary round of equity funding at a lower per share price than our carrying value 
consequently  we recorded an impairment charge of  on our existing investment 
during the first quarter of  we realized a pre tax gain of million from the sale of million shares of our investment in pti 
as of december   we owned million shares of pti 
pro rata share of loss from equity investments in september  we invested an additional million in acet  which increased our ownership share from to and required us to change from the cost method of accounting to the equity method of accounting for this investment 
under the equity method of accounting  we were required to record our interest in acet s reported net income or loss each reporting period 
in addition  we are required to restate prior period financial results to reflect the equity method of accounting from the date of the initial investment 
the year ended december   and results include a charge of million  million and million  respectively  representing our share of acet s reported net loss 
in the third quarter of  we made an additional cash investment of million in acet s common stock  along with other investing enterprises 
this brought our total investment down to of the outstanding equity of acet

we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin no 
on january  is recognized as a change in accounting principle  recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the adoption date 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin no 
was a million increase to our reserves for uncertain tax positions with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit 
we recognize interest and or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
to the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable  amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 
the amount of interest and penalties accrued upon the adoption of fin and at december  was immaterial 
our tax provision for was million on a pre tax loss of million consisting primarily of foreign income taxes and foreign withholding taxes including foreign withholding tax reserves 
our tax provision for was million which represents a decrease of million when compared to this decrease is primarily related to a reduction in federal provision due reduction in taxable income in the us 
our tax provision for was million which represents an increase of million when compared to this is primarily due to increased income in the us as well as increased withholding and associated reserves 
the increase in withholding tax was due to increased foreign license revenue 
segments a key objective of ours is to diversify our product offerings away from a pure play in flash memory to become a multi product line semiconductor company and a leading licensor of embedded flash technology 
as a consequence  the operating results that our chief operating decision maker reviews to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess performance have changed

under taiwan security regulations  due to mr 
yeh s position as a member of insyde s board of directors  a certain number of shares must be held in a central custody and are restricted from sale for a period of time 
the shares available for sale within one year are carried at the quoted market price and included in long term available for sale investments in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  and shares required to be held in custody for greater than a one year period are carried at cost and included in equity investments 
in january  we invested an additional  cash in insyde s convertible bonds that we converted to  shares of insyde s common stock in april in june  we invested an additional  cash in insyde s convertible bonds 
the stock investment was written down  during at december   our investment represented of insyde s outstanding equity 
in june  we acquired a interest in acet  a privately held taiwanese company for million cash 
acet  a related entity of kye  is a production subcontractor 
chen tsai  our senior vice president of worldwide backend operations  is also a member of acet s board of directors 
during  we recorded a  impairment charge related to our investment in acet 
acet raised an additional round of equity financing at a lower per share cost than our current basis 
consequently  we determined that our investment was other than temporarily impaired 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
in september  we invested an additional million in acet that increased our ownership share of acet s outstanding capital stock from to and required us to change from the cost method of accounting to the equity method of accounting for this investment 
under the equity method of accounting  we are required to record our interest in acet s reported net income or loss each reporting period as well as restate the prior period financial results to reflect the equity method of accounting from the date of the initial investment 
we record this expense in pro rata share of loss from equity investments on our condensed consolidated statement of operations 
under this accounting treatment  we recorded charges of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   representing our share of the losses for acet 
we also recorded  of our share of stock based compensation for acet during in addition  we recorded a gain on the change in interest ownership of million for the year ended december  in the third quarter ended september   we made an additional cash investment  among other investing enterprises  of million in acet s common stock 
at december   our investment represented a of acet s outstanding equity 
in november  we acquired a interest in nanotech corporation  or nanotech  a privately held cayman island company  for million cash 
nanotech  a development stage company  has a wholly owned subsidiary which is in the process of establishing foundry operations in china 
bing yeh  our president  ceo and chairman of our board of directors  is also a member of nanotech s board of directors 
tsuyoshi taira  a member of our board of directors  also invested in this round of financing 
during the first quarter of  we determined that our investment in nanotech  inc had become impaired as nanotech defaulted on its loan payments to certain of its business partners and began preparations to liquidate itself 
as a result  we wrote our investment down to zero as well as an outstanding loan for in may  we acquired a interest in eonex technologies  inc  or eonex  a privately held korean company  for million in cash 
during  we noted that our investee  eonex  had suffered significant declines in net revenue during fiscal in the second quarter of  eonex exhausted its on hand cash and relied on short term borrowings to sustain operations while additional liquidity sources were being pursued 
in the fourth quarter of  we noted that eonex had failed to secure additional financing and thus we concluded that our investment in eonex was impaired 
given the lack of funds and no immediate source for additional financing  we wrote off our investment in the fourth quarter of and we recorded an impairment charge for of our million carrying value of eonex 
in july  we acquired a interest in aptos technology inc  a privately held taiwanese company  for million in cash and we acquired a interest in enzytek technology inc  a privately held taiwanese company  for  in cash 
we account for these investments under cost method 
we are not obligated to provide aptos or enzytek with any additional financing 
at december   our investments in aptos and enzytek represented and  respectively  of the outstanding equity of these companies 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  cost of revenue  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board 
the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
our critical accounting estimates are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market  warranty accrual  litigation costs  valuation of equity investments  goodwill and long lived assets  provision for adverse purchase commitments  stock based compensation  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
sales to direct customers and foreign stocking representatives are recognized net of an allowance for estimated returns 
when product is shipped to direct customers or stocking representatives or by our distributors or spt to end users  prior to recognizing revenue  we also require that evidence of the arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
legal title generally passes to our customers at the time our products are shipped 
payment terms typically range from to days 
sales to distributors are made primarily under arrangements allowing price protection and the right of stock rotation on merchandise unsold 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and future returns  we defer recognition of such revenues  related costs of revenues and related gross profit until the merchandise is sold by the distributor 
products shipped to spt are accounted for as our inventory held at our logistics center  and revenue is recognized when the products have been delivered and are considered as a sale to our end customers by spt 
most of our technology licenses provide for the payment of up front license fees and continuing royalties based on product sales 
for license and other arrangements for technology that we are continuing to enhance and refine  and under which we are obligated to provide unspecified enhancements  revenue is recognized over the lesser of the estimated period that we have historically enhanced and developed refinements to the technology  approximately two to three years the upgrade period  or the remaining portion of the upgrade period from the date of delivery  provided all specified technology and documentation has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is reasonably assured 
from time to time  we reexamine the estimated upgrade period relating to licensed technology to determine if a change in the estimated upgrade period is needed 
revenue from license or other technology arrangements where we are not continuing to enhance and refine technology or are not obligated to provide unspecified enhancements is recognized upon delivery  if the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is reasonably assured 
royalties received during the upgrade period under these arrangements are recognized as revenue based on the ratio of the elapsed portion of the upgrade period to the estimated upgrade period 
the remaining portions of the royalties are recognized ratably over the remaining portion of the upgrade period 
royalties received after the upgrade period has elapsed are recognized when reported to us which generally occurs one quarter in arrears and concurrently with the receipt of payment 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates in relation to the estimated period of technology enhancement and development  the amount and timing of our license and royalty revenues could be materially affected 
allowance for sales returns 
we maintain an allowance for estimated product returns by our customers 
we estimate our allowance for sales returns based on our historical return experience  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  known returns we have not received and other estimates 
the allowance for sales returns was million  million and  as of december   and  respectively 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue could be materially different 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable  the financial condition of our customers and their payment history  our historical write off experience and other estimates 
if we were to make different judgments of the financial condition of our customers or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was   and  as of december   and  respectively 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and fluctuate substantially 
the value of our inventory is dependent on our estimate of average future selling prices  and  if average selling prices are lower than our estimate  we may be required to reduce our inventory value to reflect the lower of cost or market 
our inventories include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature or subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
we maintain allowance for inventory for potentially excess and obsolete inventories and those inventories carried at costs that are higher than their market values 
we review on hand inventory including inventory held at the logistic center for potential excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market exposure and adjust the level of inventory reserve accordingly 
some of our customers have requested that we ship them product that has a finished goods date of manufacture that is less than one year old 
in the event that this becomes a common requirement  it may be necessary for us to provide for an additional allowance for our on hand finished goods inventory with a date of manufacture of greater than one year old  which could result in additional inventory write downs 
our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories includes an allowance for our on hand finished goods inventory with a date of manufacture of greater than two years old and for certain products with a date of manufacture of greater than one year old 
for the obsolete inventory analysis  we review inventory items in detail and consider date code  customer base requirements  known product defects  planned or recent product revisions  end of life plans and diminished market demand 
if we determine that market conditions are less favorable than those currently projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in average selling prices or demand not meeting our expectations  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories and lower of cost or market reserves was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
provision for adverse purchase commitments 
we maintain a provision for adverse purchase commitments for in process orders at our vendors when we have recorded lower of cost or market valuation provision against our on hand inventory 
once production has begun against our purchase orders  we are committed to purchasing the inventory or  if we cancel the order  we are liable for all costs incurred up to the time of cancellation 
if we have written down our on hand inventory of the ordered product for lower of cost or market valuations  we must consider the impact to in process inventory at our vendor 
we evaluate our in purchase orders to determine the impact of canceling the order and the impact of purchasing the inventory at a cost higher than the estimated current market value 
if we determine that market conditions become less favorable than those currently projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in average selling prices or demand not meeting our expectations  additional inventory write downs may be required when the inventory is purchased 
the recorded provision for adverse purchase commitments was million   and  as of december   and  respectively 
warranty accrual 
our products are generally subject to warranty and we provide for the estimated future costs of repair  replacement or customer accommodation upon shipment of the product in the accompanying statements of operations 
our warranty accrual is estimated based on historical claims compared to historical revenues and assumes that we will replace products subject to a claim 
for new products  we use our historical percentage for the appropriate class of product 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the recorded value of our warranty accrual was   and  as of december   and  respectively 
litigation losses 
from time to time  we are also involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we have incurred certain costs associated with defending these matters 
there can be no assurance that shareholder class action complaints  shareholder derivative complaints or other third party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows or without requiring royalty payments in the future  all of which may adversely impact net income 
as of december   no estimate can be made of the possible loss or possible range of loss associated with the resolution of these contingencies and therefore we have not booked any accrual for such costs 
if additional information becomes available such that we can estimate with a reasonable degree of certainty that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  such costs or estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
valuation of equity investments 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations in the semiconductor industry 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results in these companies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the carrying value of our equity investments was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
we recorded impairment charges of  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
investments in non marketable equity securities are inherently risky  and a number of these companies are likely to fail 
their success is dependent on product development  market acceptance  operational efficiency  and other key business success factors 
in addition  depending on their future prospects and market conditions  they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations  with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings  and the investments would likely become impaired 
we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include a the investee s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects  b the technological feasibility of the investee s products and technologies  c the general market conditions in the investee s industry or geographic area  including adverse regulatory or economic changes  d factors related to the investee s ability to remain in business  such as the investee s liquidity  debt ratios  and the rate at which the investee is using its cash  and e the investee s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation 
investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired  in which case the investment is written down to its impaired value and a new cost basis is established 
when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view  we write off the investment  since we consider the estimated fair value to be nominal 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise 
goodwill 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances  and written down when impaired 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value 
we determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments for the purposes of completing our statement of financial accounting standards no 
we utilize a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment 
the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value based test 
in computing fair value of our reporting units  we use estimates of future revenues  costs and cash flows from such units 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities 
we perform this analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined the goodwill acquired from our acquisition of g plus and actrans had become impaired in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
furthermore  sfas no 
requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of one to five years 
long lived assets 
long lived assets include property and equipment  equity investments and intangible assets 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we estimate the future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  expected to result from the use of those assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
as part of our analysis  we determined  of long lived assets had been impaired 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we implemented sfas no 
r with regard to equity based compensation which requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation 
the fair value of stock options shares are estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires us to make subjective assumptions in implementing sfas no 
r  including expected stock price volatility  and estimated life of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the requisite service period  generally the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the accelerated method 
we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the additional paid in capital pool  or apic pool  to determine if there are any tax shortfalls which require recognition in the condensed consolidated income statements 
prior to the implementation of sfas no 
r  we accounted for stock options under the provisions of apb no 
and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the condensed consolidated financial statements were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
we use historical volatility as we believe it is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of volatility 
we use the simplified calculation of expected life described in the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
if we determined that another method used to estimate expected volatility was more reasonable than our current methods  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions was prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated for share based awards could change significantly 
higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to share based compensation determined at the date of grant 
accounting for income taxes 
we currently maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
expected future us losses represented sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded against us deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
during and  we maintained a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
at december   and the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was million  million and million  respectively 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a company s income tax return  and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin no 
utilizes a two step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

step one  recognition  requires a company to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
step two  measurement  is based on the largest amount of benefit  which is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin no 
on january  is recognized as a change in accounting principle  recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the adoption date 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin no 
was a million increase to the opening balance of accumulated deficit 
we recognize interest and or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
to the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable  amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 
the amount of interest and penalties accrued upon the adoption of fin and at december  was immaterial 
we recognize interest and or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
to the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable  amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 
the amount of interest and penalties accrued upon the adoption of fin and at december  was immaterial

our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio as of december  consists of money market funds  federal  state and municipal government obligations  foreign and public corporate debt securities and listed equity securities 
we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor  manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk 
the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer 
as a result of current adverse financial market conditions  some financial instruments  such as structured investment vehicles  sub prime mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations  may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns 
as of december   we had no direct holdings in these categories of investments and our exposure to these financial instruments through our indirect holdings in money market mutual funds was not material to total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december   we had no recorded impairment charges associated with our short term investment portfolio 
while we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity  we have taken steps  including regularly reviewing our investments and associated risk profiles  which we believe will allow us to effectively manage the risks of our investment portfolio

stock repurchase program on february  we announced that our board of directors had authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock  subject to certain specifications  up to an aggregate maximum amount of million 
the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  in compliance with the securities exchange act of rule b  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements  and other factors 
the program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion 
operating capital requirements we believe that our cash balances  together with funds we expect to generate from operations  will be sufficient to meet our projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next twelve months

factors that could affect our short term and long term cash used or generated from operations and as a result  our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include the average selling prices of our products  customer demand for our products  the need to secure future wafer production capacity from our suppliers  the timing of significant orders and of license and royalty revenue  merger  acquisition or joint venture projects  investments in strategic business partners  unanticipated research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  and the outcome of ongoing litigation

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of this statement are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied  with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for the fiscal years beginning after november  in february the fasb granted a one year deferral for certain non financial assets and liabilities to comply with sfas no 
 however  the effective date for financial assets and liabilities remains the same 
we determined upon adoption of this standard as of january  that it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas no 
the fair value option established by sfas no 
permits  but does not require  all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
an entity would report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we are currently assessing what the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
will be on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r will change the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas no 
r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r will change the accounting treatment and disclosure for certain specific items in a business combination 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  accordingly  any business combinations we engage in will be recorded and disclosed following existing gaap until january  we expect sfas no 
r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international manufacturing and sales activities 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
currently  we do not hedge these foreign exchange rate exposures 
substantially all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand could reduce revenues and or result in operating losses 
in addition  a downturn in the economies of china  japan or taiwan could impair the value of our equity investments in companies with operations in these countries 
if we consider the value of these companies to be impaired  we will write off  or expense  some or all of our investments 
in  and  we recorded equity impairments of  million and million  respectively 
at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  or the fair value of our investment portfolio 
a move in interest rates as of december  would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures
