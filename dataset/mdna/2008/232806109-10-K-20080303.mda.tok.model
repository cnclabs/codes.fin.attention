adjustments to previously announced preliminary annual results on january   we issued a press release announcing our preliminary annual results for the year ended december  in the press release  we reported net income of million in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  subsequent to the issuance of our press release  we recorded certain adjustments to our reported results relating to stock based compensation  the impact of a foreign currency remeasurement of a long term tax liability  and a reduction in the tax provision 
these adjustments totaled million  which reduced our net income to million for the year ended december  stock based compensation the additional stock based compensation expense was primarily a result of the achievement of certain performance based restricted stock units granted in fiscal that was contingent upon our performance relative to a pre determined peer group 
at the time of the press release  management was unable to determine whether the achievement had been met as certain companies in the peer group had not publicly reported their financial results 
since the issuance of our press release  these companies have reported their results and we were able to determine that the milestone related to these performance based restricted stock units has been achieved 
as a result  we recorded an additional million of stock based compensation for the year ended december  additionally  on february   the compensation committee of the board of directors made a discretionary award of  fully vested restricted stock units to tj rodgers  our president and chief executive officer 
as this grant was based upon his performance in fiscal  stock based compensation expense of million related to the restricted stock units was recorded for the year ended december  foreign currency remeasurement we recorded an additional foreign currency exchange loss of million due to the remeasurement of a long term tax liability  which was denominated in a foreign currency  into the united states dollar at the end of fiscal reduction in tax provision we recorded a million reduction in our tax provision as a result of recalculating certain available foreign tax credits recorded during fiscal the following table presents a reconciliation of the preliminary net income and net income per share announced in our press release on january  to the final results reported in this annual report on form k year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net income announced on january   adjustments stock based compensation expense  foreign currency exchange loss  reduction in tax provision  net income reported in annual report on form k  net income per share basic announced on january  basic reported in annual report on form k diluted announced on january  diluted reported in annual report on form k executive summary general our mission is to transform cypress semiconductor corporation cypress from a traditional  broad line semiconductor company to a leading supplier of programmable solutions in systems everywhere 
we deliver high performance  mixed signal  programmable solutions that provide customers with rapid time to market and system value 
our offerings include the programmable system on chip psoc products  universal serial bus usb controllers  general purpose programmable clocks and memories 
cypress also offers wired and wireless connectivity solutions that enhance connectivity and performance in multimedia handsets and other systems 
cypress serves numerous markets including consumer  computation  data communications  automotive and industrial 
in addition  we are a majority shareholder of sunpower corporation sunpower  a publicly traded company which designs  manufactures and delivers high performance solar electric systems worldwide for residential  commercial and utility scale power plant customers 
as of the end of fiscal  our organization included the following business segments business segments description consumer and computation division a product division focusing on psoc  usb and general purpose timing solutions data communications division a product division focusing on data communication devices for wireless handset and professional personal video systems memory and imaging division a product division focusing on static random access memories sram  nonvolatile memories and image sensor products sunpower a majority owned subsidiary of cypress specializing in solar products and services other includes silicon light machines and cypress systems  both majority owned subsidiaries of cypress  certain foundry related services and certain corporate expenses sunpower as of december   cypress owned approximately million shares of sunpower s class b common stock 
cypress s ownership interest in sunpower as of december  was as follows as a percentage of sunpower s total outstanding shares of capital stock as a percentage of sunpower s total outstanding shares of capital stock on a fully diluted basis as a percentage of the total voting power of sunpower s outstanding shares of capital stock only cypress  its successors in interest and its subsidiaries may hold shares of sunpower s class b common stock unless cypress distributes the shares to its stockholders in a tax free distribution 
cypress currently does not have any plans to distribute to its stockholders shares of sunpower s class b common stock  although cypress may elect to do so in the future 
cypress is continuing to explore ways in which to allow its stockholders to fully realize the value of its investment in sunpower 
there can be no assurance that cypress will commence or conclude a transaction  or take any other actions  in the short term  or at all 
acquisition and divestitures during fiscal  sunpower completed the acquisition of powerlight corporation powerlight  a privately held leading provider of large scale solar power systems for residential  commercial  government and utility customers worldwide 
the purchase consideration and future stock based compensation totaled approximately million 
the acquisition enables sunpower to extend its leadership and participation in more diversified applications and markets  develop the next generation of solar products and solutions that will accelerate solar system cost reductions to compete with retail electric rates without incentives  and simplify and improve customer experience 
in june  sunpower changed powerlight s name to sunpower corporation  systems sp systems to capitalize on sunpower s name recognition 
as part of our ongoing corporate strategy  we have divested businesses that do not align with our long term business plan to transform cypress from a traditional  broad line semiconductor company to a leading supplier of programmable system solutions 
during fiscal  we completed the following divestitures silicon valley technology center svtc  a portion of the image sensor product families  and a portion of the network search engine nse product families 
we recorded total gains of million that resulted from these divestitures 
we continue to evaluate our business strategies and may complete additional acquisitions and or divestitures in future periods 
manufacturing strategy our core manufacturing strategy flexible manufacturing combines capacity from leading foundries with output from cypress s internal manufacturing facilities 
this initiative allows us to meet rapid swings in customer demand while lessening the burden of high fixed costs  a capability that is particularly important in high volume consumer markets that we serve with our leading programmable product portfolio 
consistent with this strategy  our board of directors approved a plan in december to exit our manufacturing facility in texas and transfer production to our more cost competitive facility in minnesota and outside foundries 
since all of cypress s newer products are being designed on more advanced process technologies  management believes that it is more cost effective to shift manufacturing elsewhere than to retool the facility in texas 
cypress s manufacturing facility in minnesota offers state of the art technology and there is currently sufficient cost competitive foundry capacity in asia enabling cypress to achieve lower manufacturing costs 
cypress expects to complete the exit plan by the end of fiscal agreements with distributors in fiscal  cypress had sales agreements with certain independent distributors in asia  including japan  using the sell in revenue recognition model 
sales to these distributors were made under arrangements which did not provide these distributors with allowances such as price protection or rights of return 
as such  revenues were recognized upon shipment 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  cypress intends to negotiate new terms with these distributors 
under these new terms  these distributors will be provided with price protection and stock rotation rights 
given the uncertainties associated with the rights provided to these distributors  revenues and costs relating to sales to these distributors will be deferred until the products are sold by the distributors to the end customers 
we expect this conversion will enable us in the long term to achieve higher gross margin dollars in asia as we will now be able to manage the end customer sales 
in addition  we will be able to provide design registration for our rapidly growing proprietary businesses and align our distribution and revenue recognition policies consistently across the world 
changing the terms of these distributor agreements will require us to change from recognizing revenues at the time of shipment to recognizing revenues upon sales to the ultimate end customers 
as a result  our revenues in the first quarter of fiscal will be negatively impacted 
we currently estimate that the revenue impact of this one time event will be in the range of approximately million to million 
results of operations revenues year ended december  december  january  in thousands consumer and computation division    data communications division    memory and imaging division    sunpower    other    total revenues    consumer and computation division revenues from the consumer and computation division increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in sales of our psoc solutions  driven by new design wins  expansion of our customer base and continued market penetration in a variety of end market applications 
in addition  the increase was attributable to the continued adoption of our family of usb products in pc applications and consumer devices  which contributed an increase of million in revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in sales of our general purpose clock products primarily due to slowing demand in the base station and gaming market and increased competition  and million in sales of our pc clock products as we divested the product families in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenues from the consumer and computation division increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in sales of our psoc products  driven by increased demand and market penetration in consumer applications 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by a decline of million in sales of our communications based  general purpose clock business  primarily due to slowing demand in the base station market 
in addition  sales of our pc clock products declined million year over year  primarily because we divested the product family during the fourth quarter of fiscal data communications division revenues from the data communications division decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in sales of our nse products as we divested the remaining product families in fiscal and our specialty memory products due to the continued slowdown in demand in the base station market 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in sales of our new west bridge controllers due to production ramps and shipments to cell phone manufacturers 
revenues from the data communications division decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decline of million in sales of our nse products as we sold a portion of the product families in fiscal in addition  the decrease was partially attributable to a decline of million in sales of our specialty memory products primarily due to a greater than expected slowdown in the base station market 
memory and imaging division revenues from the memory and imaging division decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in sales of our pseudo sram product families as these products were discontinued in fiscal the decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in sales of other memory products due to increased demand for networking and communications applications 
revenues from the memory and imaging division increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal this increase was attributable to an increase of million in sales of our memory products primarily due to increased demand for networking and communications applications 
sunpower sunpower generates revenues from two businesses components  which generates revenues from sales of sunpower s solar cells  solar panels and inverters to solar systems installers and other resellers  and systems  which generates revenues from sales of engineering  procurement  construction and other services relating to solar electric power systems 
revenues from sunpower increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the increase in revenues was attributable to the combination of million in systems revenues from sp systems  which was acquired by sunpower in the first quarter of fiscal  and an increase in components revenues of million 
the increase in components revenues was attributable to the continued increase in the demand for sunpower s solar cells and solar panels  coupled with the continued increase in unit production and unit shipments of both solar cells and solar panels as sunpower continued to expand its solar manufacturing capacity 
in fiscal  sunpower had a total of four solar cell manufacturing lines with an annual production capacity of megawatts 
in fiscal  sunpower began commercial production on three additional solar cell lines with an annual production capacity of megawatts 
sunpower recognizes systems revenues related to the fixed price construction contracts on a percentage of completion basis  and  as a result  the revenue from this business is driven by the performance of its contractual obligations  which is generally driven by timelines for the installation of its solar power systems at customer sites 
accordingly  this could result in material fluctuations in sunpower s systems revenues in future periods 
revenues from sunpower increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the increase in revenues was attributable to the continued increase in unit production and unit shipments of both solar cells and solar modules as sunpower continued to expand its solar manufacturing capacity to meet strong global demand 
during the first nine months of fiscal  sunpower had one solar cell manufacturing line in operation with an annual production capacity of megawatts 
since then  sunpower has added three new production lines with an annual production capacity of megawatts 
other revenues from the other segment decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the divestiture of our svtc business in the first quarter of fiscal svtc contributed million of revenues in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues from the other segment increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase of million generated by svtc 
cost of revenues gross margin year ended december  december  january  in thousands cost of revenues    consolidated gross margin semiconductor gross margin sunpower gross margin semiconductor includes all reportable segments except for sunpower 
gross margin on a consolidated basis decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to changes in product mix  as sunpower  which generates gross margin significantly lower than our semiconductor businesses  continued to make up a larger portion of our consolidated sales 
for fiscal  sunpower accounted for approximately of our total sales compared with in fiscal we expect that sunpower will continue to increase as a percentage of total sales in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in the semiconductor gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the divestiture of our high margin svtc business in fiscal  coupled with the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs in our manufacturing facilities 
the semiconductor gross margin has also been impacted by the timing of inventory adjustments related to inventory write downs and the subsequent sale of these written down products caused by the general state of our business 
during fiscal  the net impact of the inventory adjustments was a charge of million compared to a benefit of million in fiscal in addition  stock based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenues increased approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in sunpower s gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to higher warranty and material costs  particularly costs of polysilicon ingots and wafers  and higher pre operating costs associated with its new manufacturing facilities starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  stock based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenues increased approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in gross margin was partially offset by improved manufacturing economies of scale associated with higher production volume and improved yields 
gross margin on a consolidated basis increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volumes  coupled with an overall improvement in the asps for our products 
in addition  increased efficiencies in our wafer fab utilization and improvement in the memory and imaging division s gross margin year over year due to increased asps and reduced manufacturing cost structures contributed to higher overall gross margin 
in addition  the net impact of the inventory adjustments was a benefit of million in fiscal compared with a charge of million in fiscal the increase in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially impacted by product mix  as sunpower with lower margins became a larger portion of our business and sales volumes from the data communications division with higher margins declined 
sunpower accounted for approximately of our total business in fiscal compared with only in fiscal our data communications division accounted for approximately of our total business in fiscal compared with in fiscal in addition  gross margin in fiscal was negatively impacted by the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payments  as we recorded approximately million of stock based compensation expense in cost of revenues 
the impact of stock based compensation was immaterial in fiscal research and development r d year ended december  december  january  in thousands r d expenses    as a percentage of revenues r d expenditures decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in r d expenditures was primarily driven by the reduction of employee related costs of approximately million and other cost savings of approximately million 
these cost reductions were mainly attributable to the divestitures of non strategic product lines and businesses which resulted in reduced r d activities in fiscal  coupled with the termination of certain employees related to process technology development as we reduced our efforts in this area 
the reduction in r d expenditures was partially offset by an increase of approximately million incurred by sunpower primarily due to an increased headcount and the development of next generation solar cells and new processes for solar panel assembly operations 
as a percentage of revenues  r d expenditures decreased significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the decrease in consolidated r d expenditures coupled with the significant increase in sunpower s revenues 
we anticipate that r d expenditures in absolute dollars will remain relatively flat in fiscal compared to fiscal r d expenditures increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to stock based compensation expense of million as we implemented sfas no 
r in fiscal and an increase of million in other employee related compensation expense primarily due to increases in payments under the employee bonus plans and salary increases 
the increase in r d expenditures was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in repair and maintenance related expenses and approximately million in depreciation 
selling  general and administrative sg a year ended december  december  january  in thousands sg a expenses    as a percentage of revenues sg a expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in sg a expenditures was primarily due to an increase of approximately million related to sunpower  of which approximately million was related to an increase in stock based compensation expense primarily attributable the acquisition of powerlight and the remaining million was primarily attributable to the integration of sp systems and increased employee related costs to support the expansion of sunpower s business in all areas of sales  marketing  finance and information technology 
excluding sunpower  the increase of million in sg a expenditures was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million in stock based compensation expense  higher employee related costs of approximately million primarily due to additional headcount in the sales and marketing functions and an increase of approximately million in legal costs and other professional fees 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in the allowance for uncollectible loans related to our stock purchase assistance plan 
we anticipate that sg a expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal sg a expenditures increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase was partially attributable to stock based compensation expense of million as we implemented sfas no 
r in fiscal and an increase of million in other employee related compensation expense primarily due to increases in payments under the employee bonus plans  salary increases and additional headcount and payroll costs mainly to support the growth of sunpower s business 
in addition  expenses related to professional services increased approximately million primarily due to higher legal costs and other professional fees 
the increase in sg a expense was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in sales commissions primarily because we implemented a new plan in fiscal to reduce commission rates 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets year ended december  december  january  in thousands amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  as a percentage of revenues amortization expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily driven by sunpower s acquisition of powerlight in the first quarter of fiscal  which resulted in additional amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired in fiscal the decrease in amortization expense in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease in the amortization expense of certain purchased technology intangibles  as they had been fully amortized during fiscal and  or sold to netlogic in connection with the divestiture of our nse product families during fiscal impairment of acquisition related intangible assets in january  in connection with the acquisition of powerlight  sunpower recorded million of intangible assets  of which million was related to the powerlight tradename  the primary branding and product identification for powerlight 
the determination of the fair value and useful life of the tradename was based on sunpower s strategy of continuing to market its systems products and services under the powerlight brand 
in june  sunpower formally changed its branding strategy by consolidating all of its product and service offerings under the sunpower brand and eliminating the use of the powerlight tradename 
in addition  sunpower changed powerlight s name to sp systems to capitalize on sunpower s name recognition 
as a result of the change in branding strategy  sunpower wrote off the remaining net book value of million related to the powerlight tradename 
impairment loss related to synthetic lease we held a synthetic lease for four facilities located in san jose  california and one facility located in bloomington  minnesota 
the lease was terminated in fiscal in connection with the synthetic lease  we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
see off balance sheet arrangements below for further discussion 
in process research and development charges we recorded in process research and development charges of million in connection with sunpower s acquisition of powerlight in fiscal and million in connection with cypress s acquisition of smal camera technologies smal in fiscal  as technological feasibility associated with the in process research and development projects had not been established and no alternative future use existed 
in process research and development projects related to powerlight consisted of two components design automation tool and tracking systems 
in process research and development projects related to smal consisted of two components first generation automotive cameras and mobile phone sensors 
in assessing the projects  we primarily considered key characteristics of the technology as well as its future prospects  the rate technology changes in the industry  product life cycles  and the projects stage of development 
the value of the in process research and development projects was determined using the income approach method  which calculated the sum of the discounted future cash flows attributable to the projects once commercially viable 
discount rates were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted to reflect the stage of completion of the projects and the level of risks associated with the projects 
a discount rate of was used for powerlight s projects and discount rates ranging from to were used for smal s projects 
the percentage of completion for each project was determined by identifying the development expenses invested in the project as a ratio of the total estimated development costs required to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
the following tables summarize certain information related to each project powerlight s projects projects stage of completion total costs incurred total remaining costs design automation tool as of january  acquisition date million million as of december  million million tracking systems as of january  acquisition date million million as of december  million as of december   sunpower has incurred total costs of approximately million related to the design automation tool project  of which million was incurred after the acquisition 
sunpower estimates that an additional investment of million will be required to complete the project 
sunpower expects to complete the design automation tool project by june  approximately one and a half years sooner than the original estimate 
sunpower completed the tracking systems project in june and incurred total project costs of million  of which million was incurred after the acquisition 
both the actual completion date and the total project costs were in line with the original estimates 
smal s projects projects stage of completion total costs incurred total remaining costs first generation automotive cameras as of february  acquisition date million million as of december  million mobile phone sensors as of february  acquisition date million million as of december  million we completed both projects in march and incurred total project costs of million  of which million was incurred after the acquisition 
both the actual completion date and the total project costs were in line with the original estimates 
restructuring during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan to exit cypress s manufacturing facility located in round rock  texas 
under the plan  we will transition production from the texas facility to our more cost effective facility in bloomington  minnesota as well as outside third party foundries 
we currently plan to continue operations at the texas facility through the third quarter of fiscal and expect to complete the exit plan by the end of fiscal the exact timing of the exit could vary considerably if we locate a potential buyer 
the exit plan does not involve the discontinuance of any product lines or other functions 
the exit plan will include the terminations of employees and the disposal of assets  primarily consisting of the building and manufacturing equipment  located in the texas facility 
we expect to eliminate approximately positions in the texas facility in fiscal the majority of the employees are in the manufacturing functions 
as these employees will continue to provide services during fiscal  we recognize the severance and benefit costs associated with these employees ratably over the service period in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we estimate that the total severance and benefit costs will be approximately million to million  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded million of other exit costs 
upon the ultimate disposition of the assets  we believe that we will be able to recover these assets remaining net book value 
we continue to evaluate our options related to the exit plan and may incur additional charges on such options in future periods

the decrease in cypress s ownership interest in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to sunpower s issuance of its common stock in connection with the acquisition of powerlight  cypress s sale of a portion of its ownership interest in sunpower  sunpower s follow on public offering of its common stock  and option exercises by sunpower s employees 
the decrease in cypress s ownership interest in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to sunpower s follow on public offering of its common stock  and option exercises by sunpower s employees 
immediately prior to sunpower s initial public offering in the fourth quarter of fiscal  cypress s ownership interest in sunpower was 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our consolidated cash and investments  working capital and convertible debt as of december  december  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  working capital   convertible debt short term  convertible debt long term  investment portfolio and valuations our investment policy and strategy attempts to preserve capital  meet liquidity requirements  and optimize return 
our cash is managed by an internal manager and external managers within the guidelines of our investment policy and to an objective market benchmark 
our internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance  allowing for differences in liquidity needs 
our investments are diversified  high quality investment grade securities with limited time to maturity 
in addition  our policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
currently  the average credit ratings of our portfolio are aa aa  which are high quality ratings from the major credit rating agencies 
recent volatility and credit issues in the financial market has had an adverse impact on market activities including  among other things  volatility in security prices  diminished liquidity  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
we have assessed the implications of these factors and performed valuations of our investment portfolio 
our review primarily included a pricing evaluation by comparing our portfolio against two major independent pricing sources 
except as discussed below  we noted no significant market value variance in our review 
in addition  our internal and external managers performed credit rating reviews by going through analysis and independent research to assess the credit quality of each issuer and affirmed that the average rating of our investment holdings is aa 
following the review of our investment portfolio  we identified one investment in an asset backed commercial paper where we determined that a portion of the carrying value of million was impaired as the issuer was unable to raise sufficient funding to cover the maturing obligations 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million and reclassified the remaining balance of million from cash equivalents to long term investments 
auction rate securities as of december   our investment portfolio included million of auction rate securities  which are investments with contractual maturities generally between to years 
they are usually found in the form of municipal bonds  preferred stock  a pool of student loans or collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are reset every seven to days through an auction process 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
the auction rate securities held by us are primarily backed by student loans and are over collateralized  insured and guaranteed by the united states federal department of education 
in addition  all auction rate securities held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
most of these auction rate securities were scheduled to reset subsequent to december  as of february   million of our auction rate securities have failed auctions  and we expect that the remaining auction rate securities will fail  due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
these failures are not believed to be a credit issue  but rather caused by a lack of liquidity 
under the contractual terms  the issuer is obligated to pay penalty rates should an auction fail 
in the event we need to access these funds associated with failed auctions  they are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
as a result  we have classified million of the auction rate securities as long term investments as of december  this amount represents the balance of the auction rate securities as of december  that had not been sold by us subsequent to the end of fiscal we determined that no other than temporary impairment losses existed as of december  as all holdings had successful auctions 
however  if the issuer of the auction rate securities is unable to successfully close future auctions or does not redeem the auction rate securities  or the united states government fails to support its guaranty of the obligations  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate securities and record other than temporary impairment charges in future periods 
key components of cash flows year ended december  december  january  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by financing activities   fiscal during fiscal  net cash provided by operations increased million compared to fiscal operating cash flows for fiscal was primarily driven by net income of million  adjusted for non cash items including the one time gain on cypress s sale of sunpower s common stock  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  impairment losses  gains on investments and divestitures  in process research and development charge  write off of debt issuance costs  and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to sunpower as a result of higher revenues  partially compensated by improved collection efforts 
the increase in inventories was primarily attributable to the growth at sunpower to support its production ramp 
the increase in other assets was primarily due to additional advances made by sunpower to polysilicon suppliers  coupled with higher costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings related to sunpower s construction contracts 
during fiscal  cash used in investing activities decreased million compared to fiscal for fiscal  investing activities primarily included cypress s sale of million shares of sunpower s common stock  which generated net proceeds of million  receipt of million from our divestitures  and proceeds of million from the collection of our spap loans 
these cash inflows were partially offset by million of property and equipment expenditures which included million use of cash for sunpower s purchases  purchases of million of investments  net of proceeds from sales and maturities  million of cash used in the acquisition of powerlight  net of cash acquired  and increase in restricted cash of million 
during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities increased million compared to fiscal for fiscal  financing activities primarily included proceeds of billion from the issuance of convertible debt  proceeds of million from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock plans  and proceeds of million from sunpower s follow on public offering of its common shares 
the cash inflows were partially offset by repurchases of our common shares under the accelerated share repurchase program  which used million  redemption of the cypress notes  which resulted in cash payments of million  cash payments of approximately million of debt issuance costs  and purchase of a convertible note hedge and issuance of warrants  which used million 
fiscal during fiscal  cash provided by operations increased million compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to net income generated in fiscal compared with a net loss incurred in fiscal  adjusted for certain non cash items including depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in sales  partially mitigated by improved collection efforts 
the increase in inventories was primarily due to the growth at sunpower to support its business  as well as the build up in our core semiconductor business 
increase in other assets was primarily attributable to an increase in sunpower s prepayments to its polysilicon suppliers 
during fiscal  cash used in investing activities increased million compared to fiscal we spent approximately million for purchases of property and equipment which included million use of cash for sunpower 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the proceeds from the collection of loans of million under our employee stock purchase assistance plan 
during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities increased million compared to fiscal we received proceeds of million from sunpower s follow on public offering of its common stock and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 
fiscal during fiscal  cash provided by operations decreased million compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a net loss incurred in fiscal compared with net income generated in fiscal  adjusted for certain non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  restructuring charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
during fiscal  we spent approximately million for purchases of property and equipment which included million use of cash for sunpower and used an additional million  net of cash received  in our acquisitions of smal and the minority interest in cypress microsystems 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of million  net of purchases 
during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities included approximately million of net proceeds from sunpower s initial public offering 
in addition  the issuance of common shares under our employee stock plans generated million in cash 
the increase was partially offset by repayment of debt of approximately million 
liquidity stock repurchase program in january  cypress s board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to million 
all previous repurchase programs have been terminated as a result of this new program 
the authorization allows cypress to purchase its common stock  its outstanding cypress notes or to enter into equity derivative transactions related to its common stock 
stock repurchases under the new program may be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price  corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions 
the stock repurchase program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 
as of december   cypress had not repurchased any shares and million remained outstanding under the stock repurchase program 
during the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors approved an additional million under the stock repurchase program  bringing the total amount that may be used for stock repurchases to million 
as of february   we used million in cash to repurchase a total of million shares at an average price of under the stock repurchase program  leaving million available for future expenditure 
convertible debt at the end of fiscal  cypress had million in principal amount of the cypress notes that were due in june in february  cypress called for redemption of the outstanding cypress notes 
holders had the option to convert the cypress notes into shares of cypress s common stock per  principal amount plus in cash 
alternatively  holders had the option to have their cypress notes redeemed 
upon redemption  holders would receive  plus accrued interest per  principal amount 
as a result of the redemption  cypress issued approximately million shares of its common stock and paid approximately million in cash to the holders in fiscal in march  cypress issued million in principal amount of the cypress notes 
the cypress notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semiannually in arrears in cash on march and september of each year  beginning on september  the cypress notes will mature on september  unless earlier repurchased or converted 
the cypress notes are initially convertible  subject to certain conditions  into cash up to the lesser of the principal amount of the cypress notes or the conversion value 
if the conversion value is greater than  then the excess conversion value will be convertible into cash  common stock or a combination of cash and common stock  at cypress s election 
the initial effective conversion price of the cypress notes is per share  which represents a premium of to the closing price of cypress s common stock on the date of issuance 
in connection with the issuance of the cypress notes  we entered into a separate convertible note hedge transaction 
the convertible note hedge transaction is expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the cypress notes in the event the market value per share of cypress s common stock at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of 
in addition  we sold warrants to acquire up to approximately million shares of cypress s common stock in a separate warrant transaction 
the warrants are to be settled on a net exercise basis  either in shares of stock or cash  at cypress s election 
the potential dilution caused by the warrants occurs when the value is above the exercise price of 
in conjunction with the convertible note hedge and the warrants  we paid net premiums of approximately million using a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the cypress notes 
in connection with the offering of the cypress notes  cypress entered into an accelerated share repurchase program 
pursuant to the program  cypress repurchased shares of common stock on the open market based on the volume weighted average price of cypress s common stock  subject to a per share floor price and cap price  calculated over a period of approximately three months 
the accelerated share repurchase program was funded with approximately million of net proceeds from the offering of the cypress notes 
the accelerated share repurchase program was completed in fiscal and we repurchased a total of million shares at an average price of in february  sunpower issued million in principal amount of the sunpower notes 
interest on the sunpower notes is payable on february and august of each year  commencing on august  the sunpower notes will mature on february  holders may require sunpower to repurchase all or a portion of their sunpower notes on each of february   february  and february   or if sunpower experiences certain types of corporate transactions constituting a fundamental change 
in addition  sunpower may redeem some or all of the sunpower notes on or after february  the sunpower notes are initially convertible  subject to certain conditions  into cash up to the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value 
if the conversion value is greater than  then the excess conversion value will be convertible into common stock 
the initial effective conversion price of the sunpower notes is per share  which represents a premium of to the closing price of sunpower s common stock on the date of issuance 
in july  sunpower issued million in principal amount of the sunpower notes 
the sunpower notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable on february and august of each year  commencing on february  the sunpower notes will mature on august  holders may require sunpower to repurchase all or a portion of their sunpower notes on each of august   august   august   and august   or if sunpower is involved in certain types of corporate transactions constituting a fundamental change 
in addition  sunpower may redeem some or all of the sunpower notes on or after august  the sunpower notes are initially convertible  subject to certain conditions  into cash up to the lesser of the principal amount or the conversion value 
if the conversion value is greater than  then the excess conversion value will be convertible into cash  common stock or a combination of cash and common stock  at sunpower s election 
the initial effective conversion price of the sunpower notes is per share  which represents a premium of to the closing price of sunpower s common stock on the date of issuance 
the cypress notes contain a common stock price conversion test  under which holders may convert the convertible notes if for trading days within the last trading days of the immediately preceding quarter  cypress s common stock closes at a price in excess of of the conversion price or on the last day of such calendar quarter 
the sunpower notes and the sunpower notes also contain a similar common stock price conversion test  under which holders may convert the convertible notes if for trading days within the last trading days of the immediately preceding quarter  sunpower s common stock closes at a price in excess of of the conversion prices for the sunpower notes and for the sunpower notes on the last day of such calendar quarter 
in december  the common stock price conversion test was met for the cypress notes  the sunpower notes and the sunpower notes 
accordingly  the holders may exercise their right to convert the convertible notes during the first quarter of fiscal as of february   no holders have exercised their right to convert the convertible notes 
management believes that the likelihood that any holders will actually exercise their right to convert the convertible notes is remote  given that the current market value of the convertible notes exceeds the value the holders would receive upon conversion 
our principal current sources of liquidity are cash and short term investments on our balance sheets  cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
based on our current financial condition  management believes that liquidity from these sources  combined with the potential availability of future sources of funding  including accessing debt and equity markets  will be adequate to fund our debt obligations 
since the common stock price conversion test was met and the holders are able to exercise their right to convert the convertible notes  we classified the principal amounts of our convertible notes as short term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  if the common stock price conversion test is not met in a subsequent quarter  our convertible notes may be re classified as non current debt until the convertible notes are within months of maturity or until such time when the common stock price conversion test is triggered again 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by years total and and after in thousands convertible debt principal    interest      customer advances  including interest   lease commitments     purchase obligations polysilicon     other    total contractual obligations    convertible debt includes the cypress notes  the sunpower notes and the sunpower notes 
for the purpose of this table  we assume that no holders will exercise their right to convert the convertible notes as a result of the common stock price conversion test that was triggered in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and all holders will hold the convertible notes until the maturity dates and the conversion obligations equal the principal amounts 
customer advances are related to certain agreements between sunpower and its customers under which sunpower received advance payments from the customers for future purchases of solar power products or supplies 
sunpower has agreements with certain suppliers of polysilicon  ingots  wafers  solar cells and solar panels 
these agreements specify future quantities and pricing of products to be supplied by the vendors for periods up to years and provide for certain consequences  such as forfeiture of advanced deposits and liquidated damages relating to previous purchases  in the event that sunpower terminates the arrangements 
other purchase obligations primarily include other non cancelable purchase orders for materials  services  manufacturing equipment  building improvements and supplies in the ordinary course of business 
purchase obligations are defined as enforceable agreements that are legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including quantity  price and timing 
as of december   our unrecognized tax benefits were million  which were classified as long term liabilities 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments  if any  in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing or outcomes of either actual or anticipated tax audits 
as a result  this amount is not included in the table above 
capital resources and financial condition our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and debt securities 
as of december   in addition to  million in cash and cash equivalents  we had million invested in short term investments for a total cash and short term investment position of  million that is available for use in current operations 
as of december   our consolidated cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances included approximately million of sunpower s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which are not available for general corporate use by cypress 
in may  cypress completed the sale of million shares of sunpower s class a common stock converted from class b common stock on the open market and received net proceeds of million from the transaction 
as of december   cypress held million shares of sunpower s class b common stock 
as our financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis  the fair value of cypress s ownership interest in sunpower is not recorded as an asset in the consolidated balance sheets 
in july  sunpower completed a follow on public offering of million shares of its class a common stock and received total proceeds  net of transaction costs  of approximately million 
sunpower intends to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
we believe that liquidity provided by existing cash  cash equivalents and investments and our borrowing arrangements will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  should prevailing economic conditions and or financial  business and other factors beyond our control adversely affect our estimates of our future cash requirements including our debt obligations  we could be required to fund our cash requirements by alternative financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if needed  would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may choose at any time to raise additional capital or debt to strengthen our financial position  facilitate growth  and provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities that arise 
lease guarantees during fiscal  we entered into a strategic foundry partnership with grace semiconductor manufacturing corporation grace  pursuant to which we have transferred certain of our proprietary process technologies to grace s shanghai  china facility 
in accordance with a foundry agreement executed in fiscal  we purchase wafers from grace that are produced using these process technologies 
pursuant to a master lease agreement  grace has leased from cit technologies corporation cit certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
in conjunction with the master lease agreement  we have entered into a series of guarantees with cit for the benefit of grace 
under the guarantees  we have agreed to unconditional guarantees to cit of the rental payments payable by grace for the leased equipment under the master lease agreement 
if grace fails to pay any of the quarterly rental payments  we will be obligated to pay such outstanding amounts within days of a written demand from cit 
if we fail to pay such amount  interest will accrue at a rate of per annum on any unpaid amounts 
to date  we have not made any payments under these guarantees 
pursuant to the guarantees  we obtained irrevocable letters of credit to secure the rental payments under the guarantees in the event a demand is made by cit on us 
the amount available under the letters of credit will decline according to schedules mutually agreed upon by us and cit 
if we default  cit will be entitled to draw on the letters of credit 
in connection with the guarantees  we were granted options to purchase ordinary shares of grace 
as of december   we determined that the fair values of the guarantees and the options were not material to our consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the terms of the guarantees between us and cit total irrevocable letters of credit total rental payments due lease term of equipment under each guarantee fiscal year number of guarantees at inception as of december  at inception as of december  grace shares granted to cypress in thousands one months      five months     under the current terms of the agreement as approved by our board of directors  the maximum amount of all guaranteed equipment lease obligations will not exceed approximately million 
we are under no obligation to guarantee any future payments on additional equipment leases for the benefit of grace and will do so only in our sole discretion 
off balance sheet arrangements synthetic lease in june  we entered into a synthetic lease agreement for four facilities located in san jose  california and one facility located in bloomington  minnesota 
the synthetic lease required us to purchase the properties from the lessor for million or to arrange for the properties to be acquired by a third party at lease expiration  which was june the synthetic lease obligation of million was not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
the synthetic lease required monthly payments to the lessor that varied based on libor plus a spread 
such payments totaled approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we were required to evaluate periodically the expected fair value of the properties at the end of the lease term 
as we determined that it was estimable and probable that the expected fair value of the properties at the end of the lease term would be less than million  we ratably accrued for the impairment loss over the remaining lease term 
as of december   the total impairment loss accrual was million  of which million was recorded in fiscal  million was recorded in fiscal and million was recorded in fiscal the fair value analysis on the properties was performed by management with the assistance of independent appraisal firms 
we were also required to maintain restricted cash to serve as collateral for the synthetic lease 
as of december   the balance of restricted cash and accrued interest income was million 
during fiscal  we exercised our option to purchase the properties under the synthetic lease  which included land and buildings  for million from the lessor 
the payment was made using the restricted cash collateral 
at the date of termination  we determined that an impairment loss of million existed  representing the difference between the properties fair value of million determined at the date of termination and the lease obligation of million 
as a result  we recorded an additional impairment loss of million in fiscal  representing the difference between the total impairment loss of million and million that had previously been accrued 
in addition  we recorded million related to the properties in property  plant and equipment  net in the consolidated balance sheet in fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no

 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction 
we adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item for further discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and the data used to prepare them 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and investments  stock based compensation  warranty reserves  litigation  investigation and settlement costs  and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition we generate revenues by selling products to distributors  various types of manufacturers including original equipment manufacturers oems  electronic manufacturing service providers emss and  in the case of sunpower  system integrators 
we recognize revenues on sales to oems  emss and system integrators upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
sales to certain distributors are made under agreements which provide the distributors with price protection  other allowances and stock rotation under certain circumstances 
given the uncertainties associated with the rights given to these distributors  revenues and costs relating to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the end customers 
revenues are recognized upon receiving notification from the distributors that products have been sold to the end customers 
reported information includes product resale price  quantity and end customer shipment information as well as remaining inventory on hand 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to receive payment  relieve inventory for the value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributors  and defer the related margin as deferred income on sales to distributors in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effects of distributor price adjustments are recorded as a reduction to deferred income at the time the distributors sell the products to the end customers 
we record as a reduction to revenues reserves for sales returns  price protection and allowances  based upon historical experience rates and for any specific known customer amounts 
we also provide certain distributors and emss with volume pricing discounts  such as rebates and incentives  which are recorded as a reduction to revenues at the time of sale 
these volume discounts have not been significant historically 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent  accurate and timely data from our distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
actual results could vary from those estimates 
sunpower recognizes revenues from fixed price construction contracts under the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method  revenues arising from fixed price construction contracts are recognized as work is performed based on the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total forecasted costs utilizing the most recent estimates of forecasted costs 
incurred costs include all direct material  labor  subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools and repairs 
job material costs are included in incurred costs when the job materials have been installed 
where contracts stipulate that title to job materials transfers to the customer before installation has been performed  revenues are deferred and recognized upon installation  in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
job materials are considered installed materials when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power system as required by the job s engineering design 
due to inherent uncertainties in estimating cost  job costs estimates are reviewed and or updated by sunpower s management  who determines the completed percentage of installed job materials at the end of each month  generally this information is also reviewed with the customer s on site representative 
the completed percentage of installed job materials is then used for each job to calculate the month end job material costs incurred 
direct labor  subcontractor and other costs are charged to contract costs as incurred 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
contracts may include profit incentives such as milestone bonuses 
these profit incentives are included in the contract value when their realization is reasonably assured 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by considering factors such as historical bad debt experience  specific customer creditworthiness  the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic trends that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our results of operations could be materially affected 
valuation of inventories management periodically reviews the adequacy of our inventory reserves 
we record a write down for our inventories which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
we perform a detailed review of inventories each quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  product life cycle status  product development plans and current sales levels 
inventory reserves are not relieved until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
our inventories may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to record additional write downs  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
valuation of long lived assets our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly under utilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand 
in addition  we have recorded intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analysis 
if there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges on our long lived assets 
valuation of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge 
however  changes in these estimates could cause one or more of the businesses to be valued differently  which could result in an impairment of our goodwill in the future 
valuation of equity investments we have equity investments in both publicly traded and privately held companies 
we review our investments periodically for impairment and the assessment requires significant judgment 
we recognize an impairment charge when the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
fair values for investments in public companies are determined using quoted market prices 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge on a publicly traded investment  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
our ability to recover our strategic investments in non marketable equity securities is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute their business plans and how well their products are ultimately accepted  as well as their ability to obtain venture capital funding to continue operations and to grow 
these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
our impairment assessment on investments in privately held companies includes the review of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or others 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise 
we have experienced substantial impairments in our portfolio of equity securities in the past 
if market and business conditions for our investees deteriorate in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges on our investments 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our future stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded 
warranty reserves cypress generally warrants its products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year 
sunpower warrants or guarantees the performance of its solar panels at certain levels of power output for extended periods  often as long as years 
it also warrants the solar cells for at least ten years 
in addition  sunpower generally provides warranty on systems installed for a period of five years 
we maintain warranty reserves to cover potential liability that could arise from these guarantees 
our warranty reserves reflect our best estimate of such liabilities and are based on our analysis of product returns  results of industry standard accelerated testing in sunpower s products and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we recognize our warranty reserve as a component of cost of revenue 
if actual liabilities differ from estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required 
litigation  investigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations  and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement payments 
if that occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation or investigations is probable  and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such litigation or investigations  we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates  which could require us to record additional legal costs 
accounting for income taxes our global operations involve manufacturing  research and development and selling activities 
profits from non us activities are subject to local country taxes but are not subject to us tax until repatriated to the us it is our intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination is made 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risks as of december   our non equity investment portfolio consisted of a variety of financial instruments  including  but not limited to  money market securities  commercial paper  corporate securities and government sponsored agency notes 
these investments are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our balance sheet at fair market value with their related unrealized gain or loss reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
due to the relatively short term nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe that an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we believe we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
auction rate securities as of december   our investment portfolio included million of auction rate securities  which are investments with contractual maturities generally between to years 
they are usually found in the form of municipal bonds  preferred stock  a pool of student loans or collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are reset every seven to days through an auction process 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
the auction rate securities held by us are primarily backed by student loans and are over collateralized  insured and guaranteed by the united states federal department of education 
in addition  all auction rate securities held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either aaa or aaa 
most of these auction rate securities were scheduled to reset subsequent to december  as of february   million of our auction rate securities have failed auctions  and we expect that the remaining auction rate securities will fail  due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
these failures are not believed to be a credit issue  but rather caused by a lack of liquidity 
under the contractual terms  the issuer is obligated to pay penalty rates should an auction fail 
in the event we need to access these funds associated with failed auctions  they are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
as a result  we have classified million of the auction rate securities as long term investments as of december  this amount represents the balance of the auction rate securities as of december  that had not been sold by us subsequent to the end of fiscal we determined that no other than temporary impairment losses existed as of december  as all holdings had successful auctions 
however  if the issuer of the auction rate securities is unable to successfully close future auctions or does not redeem the auction rate securities  or the united states government fails to support its guaranty of the obligations  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate securities and record other than temporary impairment charges in future periods 
convertible debt the fair market value of our convertible debt is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature 
the following table summarizes certain information related to our convertible debt as of december  convertible debt fair value fair value given a increase in market prices fair value given a decrease in market prices in thousands cypress convertible senior notes   sunpower senior convertible debentures   sunpower senior convertible debentures   the fair value of the convertible debt is determined based on the quoted prices as reported by bloomberg  which were  per  principal amount for cypress s convertible senior notes   per  principal amount for sunpower s senior convertible debentures  and  per  principal amount for sunpower s senior convertible debentures as of december  the fair value of the convertible debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair market value of the convertible debt will increase as the market price of our common stock increases and decrease as the stock price falls 
as of february   the fair value of the convertible debt was  per  principal amount for cypress s convertible senior notes   per  principal amount for sunpower s senior convertible debentures  and  per  principal amount for sunpower s senior convertible debentures 
foreign currency exchange risks the majority of our revenues  expenses and capital spending is transacted in us dollar 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the euro 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we entered into a series of euro forward and option contracts to hedge forecasted foreign denominated revenues and selected capital equipment purchases 
the total notional amount of these contracts was million as of december  a foreign currency exchange rate movement would have an impact of approximately million on these contracts 
investments in publicly traded and privately held companies we have investments  including marketable equity securities and warrants  in certain publicly traded companies other than sunpower 
the marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale investments 
they are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  our investments include warrants to purchase shares of a public company s common stock 
these warrants are classified as derivative instruments and are carried at fair value with the resulting gains or losses recognized in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of the common stock and warrants is subject to market price volatility 
the following table summarizes certain information related to these investments as of december  investments fair value fair value given a increase in stock prices fair value given a decrease in stock prices in thousands marketable equity securities    warrants our investment portfolio also includes warrants that are not classified as derivative instruments or available for sale securities 
these warrants are carried at cost and as of december   the carrying value of these warrants was million 
we have equity investments in several privately held companies  many of which are start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
as our equity investments generally do not permit us to exert significant influence or control  these amounts generally represent our cost of the investments  less any adjustments we make when we determine that an investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost 
as of december   the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was million
