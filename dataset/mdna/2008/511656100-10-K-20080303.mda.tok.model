the higher provision in versus was attributable to a number of factors  but was primarily a result of general growth in the loan portfolio as well as higher allocations on specific watch list credits  including the large additional impaired credit relationship mentioned above 
the level of loan loss provision was also influenced by other factors related to the growth in the loan portfolio  such as emerging market risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentration  new industry lending activity  general economic conditions and historical loss percentages 
in addition  management gave consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision 
management s overall view on current credit quality was also a factor in the determination of the provision for loan losses 
the company s management continued to monitor the adequacy of the provision based on loan levels  asset quality  economic conditions and other factors that may influence the assessment of the collectability of loans 
noninterest income was million in versus million in  an increase of  or 
the noninterest income included a one time gain of  which resulted from the sale of the company s retail credit card portfolio 
the increase was driven by a  or  increase in wealth advisory and investment brokerage fees

table of contents financial condition as of december   the company had offices serving twelve counties in northern indiana and one loan production office in indianapolis 
the company added a new full service branch facility in fort wayne  indiana during the new facility houses the company s fort wayne based wealth advisory services and serves the south western market of fort wayne 
the new facility replaces a limited service leased facility in downtown fort wayne 
since  the company has added seventeen new offices through acquisition and internal growth 
the company will consider future acquisition and expansion opportunities with an emphasis on markets that it believes would be receptive to its business philosophy of local  independent banking 
total assets of the company were billion as of december   an increase of million  or  when compared to billion as of december  total cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a corresponding increase in the company s loans 
total securities available for sale increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was a result of a number of activities in the securities portfolio 
paydowns from prepayments of million were received  and the amortization of premiums  net of the accretion of discounts  was  maturities  calls and sales of securities totaled million 
these portfolio decreases were offset by securities purchases totaling million 
the fair value of the securities increased million as a result of the falling yield curve environment during the investment portfolio is managed to limit the company s exposure to risk and contains mostly collateralized mortgage obligations and other securities which are either directly or indirectly backed by the federal government or a local municipal government 
as of december   the company had million of collateralized mortgage obligations which were not issued by the federal government or government sponsored agencies  but were rated aaa by s p and or aaa by moody s 
the investment portfolio did not contain any corporate debt instruments or trust preferred instruments as of december  real estate mortgages held for sale decreased by million  or  to  at december  from million at december  the balance of this asset category is subject to a high degree of variability depending on  among other things  recent mortgage loan rates and the timing of loan sales into the secondary market 
during  million in real estate mortgages were originated for sale and million in mortgages were sold  compared to million and million in as experienced by the industry generally  this lower volume of real estate mortgages originated was caused primarily due to the uncertainty in the residential real estate market 
total loans  excluding real estate mortgages held for sale  increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the mix of loan types within the company s portfolio continued a trend toward a higher percentage of the total loan portfolio being in commercial loans 
the portfolio breakdown at year end reflected commercial and industrial and agri business  residential real estate and home equity and consumer loans compared to commercial and industrial and agri business  residential real estate and home equity and consumer loans at december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  versus million  or  of total loans outstanding at december  the process of identifying probable credit losses is a subjective process 
therefore  the company maintains a general allowance to cover probable incurred credit losses within the entire portfolio 
the methodology management uses to determine the adequacy of the loan loss reserve includes the following considerations 
the company has a relatively high percentage of commercial and commercial real estate loans  most of which are extended to small or medium sized businesses 
commercial loans represent higher dollar loans to fewer customers and therefore higher credit risk than other types of loans 
pricing is adjusted to manage the higher credit risk associated with these types of loans 
the majority of fixed rate mortgage loans  which represent increased interest rate risk  are sold in the secondary market  as well as some variable rate mortgage loans 
the remainder of the variable rate mortgage loans and a small number of fixed rate mortgage loans are retained 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is at a level commensurate with the overall risk exposure of the loan portfolio 
however  if economic conditions would become unfavorable certain borrowers may experience difficulty and the level of nonperforming loans  charge offs and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision for loan losses 

table of contents loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the principal is uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred credit losses relating to specifically identified loans based on an evaluation  as well as other probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay 
management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon a monthly review of those credits 
an appropriate level of general allowance is determined after considering the following factors application of historical loss percentages  emerging market risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentrations  new industry lending activity and current economic conditions 
federal regulations require insured institutions to classify their own assets on a regular basis 
the regulations provide for three categories of classified loans substandard  doubtful and loss 
the regulations also contain a special mention category 
special mention is defined as loans that do not currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification  but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management s close attention 
assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the institution to establish specific allowances for loan losses 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  the insured institution must either establish specified allowances for loan losses in the amount of of the portion of the asset classified loss  or charge off such amount 
at december   on the basis of management s review of the loan portfolio  the company had loans totaling million on the classified loan list versus million on december  as of december   the company had million of assets classified special mention  million classified as substandard   classified as doubtful and classified as loss as compared to million  million   and at december  allowance estimates are developed by management taking into account actual loss experience  adjusted for current economic conditions 
the company discusses this methodology with regulatory authorities to ensure compliance 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the company s loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
in accordance with fasb statements and  the allowance is provided for losses that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date and is based on past events and current economic conditions  and does not include the effects of expected losses on specific loans or groups of loans that are related to future events or expected changes in economic conditions 
for a more thorough discussion of the allowance for loan losses methodology see the critical accounting policies section of this item 
the allowance for loan losses increased million from million december  to million at december  pooled loan allocations increased  from million at december  to million at december   which was primarily a result of an increase in pooled loan balances of million year over year 
specific loan allocations increased  from million at december  to million at december  this increase was primarily due to additions to the classified loan list as well as increases in the specific allocations on two commercial credits 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses decreased  from  at december  to  at december  the company has experienced growth in total loans over the last three years of million  or 
the concentration of this loan growth was in the commercial loan portfolio 
commercial loans comprised  and of the total loan portfolio at december   and traditionally  this type of lending may have more credit risk than other types of lending because of the size and diversity of the credits 
the company manages this risk by adjusting its pricing to the perceived risk of each individual credit and by diversifying the portfolio by customer  product  industry and geography 
management has historically considered growth and portfolio composition when determining loan loss allocations 
management believes that it is prudent to continue to provide for loan losses in a manner consistent with its historical approach due to the loan growth described above and current economic conditions 
as a result of the methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the provision for loan losses was million in versus million in at december   total nonperforming loans decreased by million to million from million at december  loans delinquent days or more that were included in the accompanying financial statements as accruing totaled  versus  at december  total impaired loans decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in impaired and nonperforming loans primarily resulted from the transfer to other real estate of a single borrowing relationship  a residential and commercial real estate developer 
the majority of the balance of nonperforming and impaired loans is a single commercial credit of million and million at december  and the borrower filed chapter bankruptcy late in the third quarter of and the plan for reorganization was approved late in the third quarter of borrower collateral and the personal guarantees of its principals support this credit 
the million in impaired loans are all in nonaccrual status 
the company allocated million and million of the allowance for loan losses to the impaired loans in and a loan is impaired when full payment under the original loan terms is not expected 
impairment is 
table of contents evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance may be allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
management has observed a regional softening in economic conditions in the company s markets  as well as slow downs in certain industries  including residential and commercial real estate development  recreational vehicle and mobile home manufacturing and other regional industries 
the company believes that the impact of these industry specific issues will be mitigated by its overall expansion strategy  which promotes diversification among industries as well as a continued focus on enforcement of a strong credit environment and an aggressive position on loan work out situations 
the allowance for loan loss to total loans percentage was in  and in the company s total nonperforming loans were of total loans at year end versus of total loans at the end of however  the company s overall asset quality position can be influenced by a small number of credits due to the focus on commercial lending activity 
total deposits increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase resulted from increases of million in other certificates of deposit  million in money market deposit accounts and million in certificates of deposit of  and over 
these increases were offset by decreases of million in brokered deposits  million in interest bearing transaction accounts  million in public fund certificates of deposit of  and over and million in demand deposits 
total short term borrowings increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase resulted from increases of million in federal funds purchased  million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase  million in other short term borrowings  primarily short term advances from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis and  in us treasury demand notes 
the company believes that a strong  appropriately managed capital position is critical to long term earnings and expansion 
bank regulatory agencies exclude the market value adjustment created by sfas no 
afs adjustment from capital adequacy calculations 
excluding this adjustment from the calculation  the company had a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier i risk based capital ratio of as of december  these ratios met or exceeded the federal reserve s well capitalized minimums of and  respectively 
the ability to maintain these ratios is a function of the balance between net income and a prudent dividend policy 
total stockholders equity increased by to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in resulted from net income of million  as well as the following factors cash dividends of million  a favorable change in the afs adjustment for the market valuation on securities held for sale of million  net of tax  positive pension liability adjustment of  net of tax   for the acquisition of treasury stock and million related to stock option exercises 
total stockholders equity increased by to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in resulted from net income of million  as well as the following factors cash dividends of million  a favorable change in the afs adjustment for the market valuation on securities held for sale of  net of tax  positive minimum pension liability adjustment of  net of tax  an adjustment to initially apply sfas no 
of  net of tax   for the acquisition of treasury stock and million related to stock option exercises 

table of contents the afs adjustment was primarily related to a basis point decrease in the two to five year us treasury rates during management has factored this into the determination of the size of the afs portfolio to assure that stockholders equity is adequate under various scenarios 
critical accounting policies certain of the company s accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances 
some of the facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include changes in interest rates  in the performance of the economy or in the financial condition of borrowers 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable incurred credit losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that a loan will not be repaid 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
allocations of the allowance are made for specific loans and for pools of similar types of loans  although the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged against the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is taken based on management s ongoing evaluation of the appropriate allowance balance 
a formal evaluation of the adequacy of the loan loss allowance is conducted at least monthly and more often if deemed necessary 
the ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the company s control 
the level of loan loss provision is influenced by growth in the overall loan portfolio  emerging market risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentration  new industry lending activity  general economic conditions and historical loss analysis 
in addition  management gives consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision 
furthermore  management s overall view on credit quality is a factor in the determination of the provision 
the determination of the appropriate allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires significant estimates 
the company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that generally includes consideration of the following factors changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality and current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to repay 
consideration is not limited to these factors  although they represent the most commonly cited factors 
with respect to specific allocation levels for individual credits  management generally considers the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows and the valuation of collateral as the primary measures 
management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon an ongoing review of those credits 
with respect to pools of similar loans  we generally use percentage allocations based upon historical analysis 
we may also adjust these allocations for other factors cited above 
an appropriate level of general allowance for pooled loans is determined after considering the following application of historical loss percentages  emerging market risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentration  new industry lending activity and general economic conditions 
it is also possible that the following could affect the overall process social  political  economic and terrorist events or activities 
all of these factors are susceptible to significant change 
as a result of this detailed process  the allowance results in two forms of allocations  specific and general 
these two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
commercial loans are subject to a dual standardized grading process administered by the credit administration and internal loan review functions 
a credit grade is assigned to each commercial loan by both the commercial loan officer and the loan review department 
these grade assignments are performed independent of each other and a loan may or may not be graded the same 
the grade given by the loan review department is the assigned in the company s loan system for individual credits 
the need for specific allocation of the loan loss reserve is considered for individual credits when graded special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
other considerations with respect to specific allocations for individual credits include  but are not limited to  the following a does the customer s cash flow or net worth appear insufficient to repay the loan  b is there adequate collateral to repay the loan  c has the loan been criticized in a regulatory examination  d is the loan on non accrual  e are there other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or f are there unique loan characteristics require special monitoring 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that we believe indicates the loan is impaired 

table of contents allocations are also applied to categories of loans not considered individually impaired but for which the rate of loss is expected to be consistent with or greater than historical averages 
such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values 
in addition  general allocations are made for other pools of loans  including non classified loans 
these general pooled loan allocations are performed for similar portfolios of consumer and residential real estate loans  and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss 
general allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on a five year historical average for loan losses for these portfolios  judgmentally adjusted for economic factors and portfolio trends 
due to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses  the company s allowance for loan losses includes an unallocated component 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the company s judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations  including factors such as the level of classified credits  economic uncertainties  industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments  broad portfolio quality trends and trends in the composition of the company s large commercial loan portfolio and related large dollar exposures to individual borrowers 
mortgage servicing rights valuation the company adopted sfas no 
on january   and for sales of mortgage loans beginning in  mortgage servicing rights msrs are initially recognized as assets for the full fair value of retained servicing rights on loans sold 
for sales of mortgage loans prior to january   a portion of the cost of the loan was allocated to the servicing right based on relative fair values 
subsequent measurement uses the amortization method where all servicing rights are expensed in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing revenues 
impairment is evaluated based on the fair value of the rights  using groupings of the underlying loans as to type and interest rate 
fair value is determined based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
to determine the fair value of msrs  the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income 
in using this valuation method  the company incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income  which include estimates of prepayment speeds  discount rate  cost to service  escrow account earnings  contractual servicing fee income  ancillary income  late fees  and float income 
the company compares the valuation model inputs and results to published industry data in order to validate the model results and assumptions 
the most significant assumption used to value msrs is prepayment rate 
in general  during periods of declining interest rates  the value of msrs decline due to increasing prepayment speeds attributable to increased mortgage refinancing activity 
prepayment rates are estimated based on published industry consensus prepayment rates 
prepayments will increase or decrease in correlation with market interest rates and actual prepayments generally differ from initial estimates 
if actual prepayment rates are different than originally estimated  the company may receive less mortgage servicing income  which could reduce the value of the msrs 
other assumptions used in estimating the fair value of msrs do not generally fluctuate to the same degree as prepayment rates  and therefore the fair value of msrs is less sensitive to changes in these other assumptions 
the servicing assets had a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of mortgage servicing rights to an immediate and adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows fair value of mortgage servicing assets constant prepayment speed psa impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change discount rate impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in value based on a and variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in value may not be linear 
also  in this table  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the value of the servicing asset is calculated without changing any other assumption  in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 

table of contents on a monthly basis  the company evaluates the possible impairment of msrs based on the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value of msrs 
for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment  the company stratifies its portfolios on the basis of certain risk characteristics  including loan type and interest rate 
if impairment exists  a valuation allowance is established for any excess of amortized cost over the current fair value  by risk stratification  through a charge to income 
if the company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular strata  a reduction of the valuation allowance may be recorded as an increase to income

sab is effective for derivative loan commitments issued or modified in fiscal quarters beginning after december  the company does not anticipate the adoption of this standard will have any material effect on the company s operating results or financial condition

liquidity management maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run off that may occur in the normal course of business 
the company relies on a number of different sources in order to meet these potential liquidity demands 
the primary sources are increases in deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments and the securities portfolio 
given current prepayment assumptions  the cash flow from the securities portfolio is expected to provide approximately million of funding in in addition to these primary sources of funds  management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements 
as of december   the company had million in federal funds lines with correspondent banks and may borrow up to million at the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
the company had all of its securities in the available for sale afs portfolio at december  therefore  the company may sell securities to meet funding demands 
management believes that the securities in the afs portfolio are of high quality and would therefore be marketable 
approximately of this portfolio is comprised of federal agency securities or mortgage backed securities directly or indirectly backed by the federal government 
in addition  the company has historically sold the majority of its originated mortgage loans on the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and to create an additional source of funding 
during  cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million as of december  to million as of december  the primary driver of this decrease was an increase in loan balances of million  which is net of approximately million of loans originated and sold in another use of funds was purchases of securities of million 
sources of funds were proceeds from short term borrowings of million  proceeds from maturities  calls and principal paydowns of securities of million  proceeds from loan sales of million and proceeds from the sale of securities of million 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased million from million as of december  to million as of december  the primary driver of this increase was an increase in deposit balances of million 
other sources of funds were proceeds from maturities  calls and principal paydowns of securities of million and proceeds from loan sales of million 
the primary use of funds was a million increase in net loans  which is net of approximately million in loans originated and sold during other uses of funds were purchases of securities of million and payments on short term borrowings of million 
during  cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million as of december  to million as of december  the primary driver of this decrease was an increase in net loans of million  which is net of approximately million of loans originated and sold during other uses of funds were purchases of securities of million and payments on long term borrowings of million 
sources of funds were a net increase in deposits of million  proceeds from maturities  calls and principal paydowns of securities of million and proceeds from loan sales of million

table of contents the following tables disclose information on the maturity of the company s contractual long term obligations and commitments 
certificates of deposit listed are those with original maturities of year or more 
payments due by period one year after total or less years years years in thousands certificates of deposit long term debt operating leases subordinated debentures total contractual long term cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total amount one year over one committed or less year in thousands unused loan commitments commercial letters of credit standby letters of credit total commitments and letters of credit off balance sheet transactions during the normal course of business  the company becomes a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in order to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to make loans and open ended revolving lines of credit 
the company follows the same credit policy including requiring collateral  if deemed appropriate to make such commitments as is followed for those loans that are recorded in its financial statements 
the company s exposure to credit losses in the event of nonperformance is represented by the contractual amount of the commitments 
management does not expect any significant losses as a result of these commitments 
off balance sheet transactions are more fully discussed in note inflation the effects of price changes and inflation can vary substantially for most financial institutions 
while management believes that inflation affects the growth of total assets  it believes that it is difficult to assess the overall impact 
management believes this to be the case due to the fact that generally neither the timing nor the magnitude of the inflationary changes in the consumer price index cpi coincides with changes in interest rates 
the price of one or more of the components of the cpi may fluctuate considerably and thereby influence the overall cpi without having a corresponding affect on interest rates or upon the cost of those goods and services normally purchased by the company 
in years of high inflation and high interest rates  intermediate and long term interest rates tend to increase  thereby adversely impacting the market values of investment securities  mortgage loans and other long term fixed rate loans 
in addition  higher short term interest rates caused by inflation tend to increase the cost of funds 
in other years  the reverse situation may occur

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management alco and securities interest rate risk represents the company s primary market risk exposure 
the company does not have material exposure to foreign currency exchange risk  does not own any significant derivative financial instruments and does not maintain a trading portfolio 
the board of directors annually reviews and approves the alco policy used to manage interest rate risk 
this policy sets guidelines for balance sheet structure  which are designed to protect the company from the impact that interest rate changes could have on net income  but does not necessarily indicate the effect on future net interest income 
given the company s mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest bearing assets on december   the net interest margin could be expected to decline in a falling interest rate environment and conversely  to increase in a rising rate environment

in the three meeting from september through december the fomc lowered the rate from to 
despite these rate cuts  the yield on earning assets increased from for to for the increase in the yield on earning assets was offset by an increase in the rates paid on deposit accounts 
the rate paid on deposit accounts and purchased funds increased from for to for the combined result of the increase in the yield on earning assets and the increase in the rates paid on deposits and purchased funds was a decrease in the net margin from for to for future changes in the net interest margin will be dependent upon multiple factors including further actions by the fomc during in response to economic conditions  competitive pressures in the various markets served  and changes in the structure of the balance sheet in as a result of changes in customer demands for products and services 
the company utilizes a computer program to stress test the balance sheet under a wide variety of interest rate scenarios 
the model quantifies the income impact of changes in customer preference for products  basis risk between the assets and the liabilities that support them and the risk inherent in different yield curves  as well as other factors 
the alco committee reviews these possible outcomes and makes loan  investment and deposit decisions that maintain reasonable balance sheet structure in light of potential interest rate movements
