item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of avnet and the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the description of the business appearing in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  and other information appearing in item of this report 
the company operates on a week fiscal year 
the fiscal years ended june   june  and july  all contained weeks 
there are numerous references to the impact of foreign currency translation in the discussion of the company s results of operations that follow 
over the past several years  the exchange rates between the us dollar and many foreign currencies  especially the euro  have fluctuated significantly 
for example  the us dollar has weakened against the euro by approximately when comparing fiscal with fiscal and approximately when comparing fiscal with fiscal when the weaker us dollar exchange rates of the current year are used to translate the results of operations of avnet s subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies  the resulting impact is an increase in us dollars of reported results as compared with the prior period 
in the discussion that follows  this is referred to as the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
when this translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is excluded from the reported results on a pro forma basis  it is referred to as constant dollars 
results as reported in the financial statements which include this translation impact are referred to as delivered dollars or reported dollars 
in addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company also discloses certain non gaap financial information such as income or expense items as adjusted for the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as discussed above  or adjusted for the impact of acquisitions by adjusting avnet s prior periods to include the sales of businesses acquired as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the period presented and divestitures by adjusting avnet s prior periods to exclude the sales of businesses divested as if the divestitures had occurred at the beginning of the period presented 
in the discussion that follows  the term pro forma sales or organic sales refers to sales adjusted to exclude this impact of acquisitions and divestiture and the impact of the change to net revenue reporting as discussed below 
management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand operating performance  especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods  primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to gaap results 
management also uses these non gaap measures to establish operational goals and  in some cases  for measuring performance for compensation purposes 
however  analysis of results and outlook on a non gaap basis should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  data presented in accordance with gaap 

table of contents results of operations executive summary comparative financial results for avnet were impacted by acquisitions and a weaker us dollar versus the euro when comparing fiscal with fiscal as presented in the following table  the company acquired nine businesses in the eighteen months prior to the end of fiscal impacting both operating groups 
operating acquired business group region acquisition date access distribution ts americas  emea december  azure technologies ts asia pac april  flint distribution ltd 
em emea july  division of magirus group ts emea october  betronik gmbh em emea october  channelworx ts asia pac october  division of acal plc ltd 
ts emea december  yel electronics hong kong ltd 
em asia pac december  azzurri technology em emea march  in addition  a change to net revenue reporting impacted the comparative financial results for avnet when comparing fiscal results to fiscal and  to a lesser extent  fiscal results with fiscal in conjunction with the acquisition of access distribution and reflecting recent industry trends  the company reviewed its method of recording revenue related to the sales of supplier service contracts and determined that such sales were to be classified on a net revenue basis rather than on a gross basis effective the third quarter of fiscal referred to as the change to net revenue reporting in this md a 
although this change reduced sales and cost of sales and positively impacted gross and operating profit margins for the technology solutions operating group and on a consolidated basis  it had no impact on operating income  net income  cash flow or the balance sheet 
as mentioned previously  during fiscal  avnet s sales growth was driven primarily by acquisitions and the weakening of the us dollar as organic sales growth in constant dollars was essentially flat year over year 
however  the company s focus on working capital management and cost reduction initiatives resulted in an increase in return on capital as compared with prior periods 
avnet s consolidated sales were billion for fiscal  up year over year  as a result of sales growth at em and at ts  with both operating groups benefiting from acquisitions 
on a pro forma basis  year over year sales growth was for the company with em and ts contributing and  respectively 
despite the slowdown in organic growth  the company improved both operating income and working capital velocity and generated over million in cash from operations 
avnet s consolidated gross profit margin of was down basis points from the prior year gross profit margin of and operating income margin of declined basis points from in prior year  primarily due to a slowdown in organic growth in certain product lines and a business mix shift as ts  which has lower gross profit margins than em  grew to be a larger percentage of consolidated sales as a result of acquisitions 
in response  management took actions during the second half of the fiscal year to adjust the company s cost structure and  as such  recorded million pre tax in restructuring  integration and other charges during fiscal operating efficiency and working capital management remain a key focus of avnet s overall value based management initiatives to increase return on capital to grow profitability at a faster rate than its growth in revenues 
it is difficult for the company  as a distributor  to forecast the material trends of the electronic component and computer products industry  aside from some of the normal seasonality discussed herein  because avnet does not typically have material forward looking information available from its customers and suppliers beyond a few months of forecast information by way of incoming order rates 
as such  management relies on the publicly available information published by certain industry groups and other related analyses in evaluating its business plans in the longer term

as previously discussed  the sales growth was driven primarily by acquisitions and the weakening of the us dollar against the euro as an estimated million of the increase in sales was attributable to the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
on a pro forma basis  consolidated sales and sales for em and ts were roughly higher year over year 
em generated fiscal sales of billion  representing a increase over fiscal sales 
excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  em fiscal sales increased over the prior year 
on a pro forma basis  em sales increased over fiscal em americas year over year growth was while the emea region sales were up year over year and down excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates

excluding the positive translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  ts sales were up year over year 
on a pro forma basis  ts sales grew over prior year 
at a regional level  sales in the americas region were up year over year on a reported basis and up on a pro forma basis as growth in storage and networking offset declines in proprietary servers 
in emea  sales were up on a reported basis and up on a pro forma basis 
in asia  sales growth was year over year on a reported basis which benefited by acquisitions 
on a pro forma basis  asia grew over prior year  impacted by relatively weak microprocessor and memory product sales in the last quarter of fiscal avnet s fiscal sales were billion  a billion increase  or  over fiscal consolidated sales of billion 
growth occurred in all three geographic regions and in both operating groups during fiscal of the billion year over year increase  approximately million was a result of the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
more than half of the reported sales growth was attributable to the access and azure acquisitions 
as presented in the preceding tables  the comparison of fiscal sales to prior year were also impacted by acquisitions  prior year divestitures and the change to net revenue reporting 
when the impacts of these items are considered in both fiscal and  consolidated sales growth would have been 
both em and ts contributed to the year over year improvement in sales 
specifically  fiscal sales for em were billion  up million  or over fiscal fiscal sales for ts were billion  up billion  or  as compared with sales of billion for fiscal including access and azure in the periods prior to the acquisition dates and including the change to net revenue reporting for periods prior to third quarter of fiscal  ts year over year sales growth would have been 

table of contents gross profit and gross profit margins consolidated gross profit was billion in fiscal  a million increase  or  compared with fiscal this increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and the year over year weakening of the us dollar against the euro 
consolidated gross profit margin of in fiscal decreased basis points from the prior year due primarily to slightly lower margins at ts and the mix of business between em and ts described below 
the em asia business continued to grow faster than the americas or emea regions  and although the em asia business has relatively lower gross profit margin than the other regions  em s gross profit margin increased basis points over prior year 
ts gross profit margins declined basis points year over year 
in addition  as a result of the acquisitions in fiscal  ts sales grew to of the consolidated sales as compared to of the consolidated sales in fiscal because the ts business typically yields lower gross margins relative to the em business  the larger representation by ts in the consolidated sales also has a negative impact on the consolidated gross profit margin 
notwithstanding the lower gross profit margins  the ts business contributes to the company s performance goals through the combination of its operating profit margin and asset velocity which is typically higher than asset velocity at em 
consolidated gross profit was billion in fiscal  up million  or  as compared with fiscal the gross profit in fiscal included a charge totaling million to write down inventory due primarily to the company s decision to terminate certain supplier relationships in connection with the memec acquisition in fiscal see restructuring  integration and other charges for further discussion 
gross profit margin of was up basis points as compared with fiscal profit margin of 
both operating groups contributed to the improvement in gross profit margins with an increase of basis points at em and basis points at ts 
the impact to consolidated gross margins resulted from the change in the mix of business between em and ts over the prior year as a result of the access acquisition as well as the change from gross revenue to net revenue reporting for supplier service contracts 
for em  the mix of revenues among small to medium businesses and large customers  particularly large ems customers  positively impacted em s gross profit margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal were billion  a million increase  or  compared with fiscal the year over year increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to acquisitions and the weakening of the us dollar versus the euro 
management estimates that approximately million of the sg a expense increase was attributable to the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sg a expenses were also impacted by the overall volume increase due to acquisitions 
furthermore  management believed that during second half of fiscal  sg a expenses were higher than necessary to support the level of business in certain business segments due to revenue weakness in those segments 
as a result  during the second half of fiscal  management took actions  as described in restructuring  integration and other charges  to adjust the company s cost structure as deemed appropriate 
further cost reduction initiatives are taking place in the first quarter of fiscal to address continued weakness in certain business segments 
metrics that management monitors with respect to its operating expenses are sg a expenses as a percentage of sales and as a percentage of gross profit 
in fiscal  sg a expenses were of sales and of gross profit as compared with and  respectively  in fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of sales for fiscal were flat as compared with fiscal  however  sg a expenses as a percentage of gross profits were up basis points 
as previously discussed  management has taken actions to address the factors they believe had an impact on the lack of attainment of sg a expense metrics 
sg a expenses in fiscal were billion  a million increase  or  compared with fiscal excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sg a expenses were down 
the year over year comparison of expenses was positively impacted by the divestitures of businesses in the second half of fiscal  further cost reduction initiatives during fiscal see restructuring  integration and other charges for further discussion and the synergy benefits associated with the memec integration during fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of sales were in fiscal  down basis points  as compared with in fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of gross profit were in fiscal  down basis 
table of contents points  as compared with in fiscal  however  this metric for fiscal was negatively impacted by the million line termination charge see restructuring  integration and other charges for further discussion 
the year over year improvement in both of these metrics is primarily due to the company s realization of operating expense synergies following the acquisition and integration of memec 
the metrics were also positively impacted by the company s ongoing focus on managing levels of operating costs through its various operational excellence initiatives

year ended july  gross operating pre tax net diluted profit income income income eps in thousands  except per share data restructuring  integration and other charges loss on sale of assets  net debt extinguishment costs total critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon the company s continuous evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting polices as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes the company s most critical accounting policies relate to valuation of receivables the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customer defaults 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as the company s regular assessment of the financial condition of its customers 
therefore  if collection experience or the financial condition 
table of contents of specific customers were to deteriorate  management would evaluate whether additional allowances and corresponding charges to the consolidated statement of operations are required 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in first out or estimated market value 
the company s inventories include high technology components  embedded systems and computing technologies sold into rapidly changing  cyclical and competitive markets wherein such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company regularly evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories less marketable 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers  which may provide certain protections to the company for product obsolescence and price erosion in the form of rights of return and price protection 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  management would evaluate whether additional write downs of inventories are required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
in addition  the company considers historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an additional valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
the company establishes reserves for potentially unfavorable outcomes of positions taken on certain tax matters 
these reserves are based on management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
there may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in reversals of reserves or additional tax liabilities in excess of the reserved amounts 
to the extent such adjustments are warranted  the company s effective tax rate may potentially fluctuate as a result 
restructuring  integration and impairment charges the company has been subject to the financial impact of integrating acquired businesses and charges related to business reorganizations 
in connection with such events  management is required to make estimates about the financial impact of such matters that are inherently uncertain 
accrued liabilities and reserves are established to cover the cost of severance  facility consolidation and closure  lease termination fees  inventory adjustments based upon acquisition related termination of supplier agreements and or the re evaluation of the acquired working capital assets inventory and accounts receivable  and write down of other acquired assets including goodwill 
actual amounts incurred could be different from those estimated 
additionally  in assessing the company s goodwill for impairment in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to make significant assumptions about the future cash flows and overall performance of its reporting units 
should these assumptions or the structure of the reporting units change in the future based upon market conditions or changes in business strategy  the company may be required to record impairment charges to goodwill 

table of contents contingencies and litigation the company is involved in various legal proceedings and other claims related to environmental  labor  product liability  intellectual property and other matters  all of which arise in the normal course of business 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome to these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis by management and internal and  when necessary  external counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to developments or a change in circumstances  which could increase or decrease earnings in the period the changes are effective 
revenue recognition the company does not consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy due to the nature of its business in which revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met upon the actual shipment of product to the customer 
accordingly  other than for estimates related to possible returns of products from customers  discounts or rebates  the recording of revenue does not require significant judgments or estimates 
provisions for returns are estimated based on historical sales returns  credit memo analysis and other known factors 
provisions are made for discounts and rebates  which are primarily volume based  and are generally based on historical trends and anticipated customer buying patterns 
finally  revenues from maintenance contracts  which are deferred and recognized in income over the life of the agreement  are not material to the consolidated results of operations of the company

covenants and conditions the securitization program discussed previously requires the company to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios as defined in the credit agreement see discussion below in order to continue utilizing the program 
the program agreement also contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold 
if these conditions are not met  the company may not be able to borrow any additional funds and the financial institutions may consider this an amortization event  as defined in the agreement  which would permit the financial institutions to liquidate the accounts receivable sold to cover any outstanding borrowings 
circumstances that could affect the company s ability to meet the required covenants and conditions of the agreement include the company s ongoing profitability and various other economic  market and industry factors

subsequent to fiscal year end  the company utilized approximately million of 
table of contents cash and cash equivalents to fund three additional acquisitions that closed in the first quarter of fiscal the company has no other significant financial commitments outside of normal debt and lease maturities discussed in capital structure and contractual obligations 
management believes that avnet s borrowing capacity  its current cash availability and the company s expected ability to generate operating cash flows are sufficient to meet its projected financing needs 
generally  the company is more likely to utilize operating cash flows for working capital requirements in a growing electronic component and computer products industry 
however  additional cash requirements for working capital are generally expected to be offset by the operating cash flows generated by the company s enhanced profitability resulting from the company s cost reductions achieved in recent years and its focus on profitable growth

table of contents at june   the company had a liability for income tax contingencies or unrecognized tax benefits of million 
management estimates approximately million associated with the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is reasonably expected to be paid in the next twelve months

the company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements  from time to time  which are intended to provide a hedge against all or a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
the company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
the company has used interest rate swaps that convert certain fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
during fiscal year  the company terminated its remaining swaps in connection with the redemption of its notes see financing transactions 
there were no interest rate swaps outstanding as of the end of fiscal years and the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of the company s debt outstanding at june  dollars in millions fiscal year thereafter total liabilities fixed rate debt floating rate debt excludes discounts on long term notes 
the following table sets forth the carrying value and fair value of the company s debt at june  dollars in millions carrying value at fair value at carrying value at fair value at june  june  june  june  liabilities fixed rate debt average interest rate floating rate debt average interest rate excludes discounts and premiums on long term notes 
many of the company s subsidiaries  from time to time  purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies 
this subjects the company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging offsetting receivables and payables as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of less than sixty days 
the company adjusts all foreign denominated balances and any outstanding foreign exchange contracts to fair market value through the consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  the market risk related to foreign exchange contracts is offset by changes in valuation of the underlying items being hedged 
the asset or liability representing the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is classified in the captions other current assets or accrued expenses and other  as applicable  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
a hypothetical change in currency exchange rates under the contracts outstanding at june  would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million to the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts  which would generally be offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged positions
