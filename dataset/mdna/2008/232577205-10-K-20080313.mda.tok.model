critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth above are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgment and estimates by us in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition and deferred revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we recognize revenue from sales of aesthetic treatment systems and accessories when each of the following four criteria are met delivery has occurred  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period as services are provided 
we are party to a revenue sharing arrangement with an operator and franchisor of spa franchises and recognize revenue from this arrangement in the period in which the procedures are performed 
we defer  until earned  payments that we receive in advance of product delivery or performance of services 
when we enter into arrangements with multiple elements  which may include sales of products together with service contracts and warranties  we allocate revenue among the elements based on each element s fair value in accordance with the principles of emerging issues task force issue number  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this allocation requires us to make estimates of fair value for each element 
accounts receivable and concentration of credit risk our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million as of december   compared with million as of december  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million and as of december  was million 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the aging of our receivable balances  known collectibility issues and our historical experience with losses 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we may not continue to experience the same credit losses that we have in the past  which could cause our provisions for doubtful accounts to increase 
we work to mitigate bad debt exposure through our credit evaluation policies  reasonably short payment terms and geographical dispersion of sales 
our revenues include export sales to foreign companies located principally in europe  the asia pacific region and the middle east 
we obtain letters of credit for foreign sales that we consider to be at risk 
inventories and allowance for obsolescence we state all inventories at the lower of cost or market value  determined on a first in  first out method 
we monitor standard costs on a monthly basis and update them annually and as necessary to reflect changes in raw material costs and labor and overhead rates 
our inventory balance was million as of december  compared to million as of december  our inventory allowance as of december  was million and as of december  was million 
we provide inventory allowances when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when we sell products 

table of contents product warranty costs and provisions we provide a one year parts and labor warranty on end user sales of our aesthetic treatment systems 
distributor sales generally include a warranty on parts only 
we estimate and provide for future costs for initial product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we base product warranty costs on related material costs  technical support labor costs and overhead 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties by considering historical material  labor and overhead expenses and applying the experience rates to the outstanding warranty period for products sold 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates and warranty costs 
if actual product failure rates  material usage  service delivery costs or overhead costs differ from our estimates  we would be required to revise our estimated warranty liability 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based awards under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
the modified prospective transition method is one in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date for all share based payments granted after the effective date and for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
in addition  sfas r requires companies to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period  whereas  sfas permitted companies to record forfeitures based on actual forfeitures  which was our historical policy under sfas during the year ended december   we applied an estimated annual forfeiture rate of in determining the expense recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
upon review of our actual rate of forfeitures since the adoption of sfas r  and in consideration of management s expectations for future forfeitures  we changed our estimated annual forfeiture rate in from to 
this change in estimate was applied retrospectively and we recorded a cumulative catch up adjustment of approximately  as a reduction in stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  option pricing models require the input of various subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
due to our initial public offering in december  we believe there is not adequate information on the volatility of our own shares 
as such  our estimated expected stock price volatility is based on a weighted average of our own historic volatility and the average volatility of other similar companies in the same industry 
we believe this is more reflective and a better indicator of the expected future volatility  than using an average of a comparable market index or of a comparable company in the same industry 
our expected term of options granted since adoption of sfas r was derived from the short cut method described in sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
we account for transactions in which services are received from non employees in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with sfas no

 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because we assume that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  giving rise to a deferred tax asset 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fas  accounting for income taxes  fin on january  fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we generally report tax positions in our financial statements as they are reported on tax returns as filed or to be filed 
a tax benefit is reflected in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that we will be able to sustain the tax position  based on its technical merits 
tax benefits from uncertain tax positions that reduce current or future income tax liabilities are reported in the financial statements only to the extent each benefit is recognized and measured  in accordance with the provisions of fin as a result of adopting fin  we determined that no material cumulative effect adjustment was necessary to the opening balance of retained earnings as of january  we further determined  based on our analysis  that there were no significant unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate for the year ended december  recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of this statement are to be applied prospectively as of january   with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  in order to permit entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and  thereby  mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected shall be reported in earnings 
the provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively as of january   however early adoption is permitted  subject to certain restrictions  as defined 
sfas does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

r  applying the acquisition method sfas r  which replaces fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
this statement retains the fundamental requirements in statement that the acquisition method of accounting which statement called the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
this statement defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control 
statement did not define the acquirer  although it included guidance on identifying the acquirer  as does this statement 
this statement s scope is broader than that of statement  which applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration 
by applying the same method of accounting the acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses  this statement improves the comparability of the information about business combinations provided in financial reports 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements  except not for profit organizations  but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary 
this statement amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
sfas shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements 
the presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity 
our marketable securities portfolio  which totaled million at december   includes auction rate securities ars of million from various issuers collateralized by student loans and municipal debt 
arss are securities with long term contractual maturities but with interest rates that are reset every seven to thirty five days by auctions 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
on february   certain arss that we hold experienced failed auctions that limited the liquidity of these securities 
based on current market conditions  it is likely that auction failures will continue that could result in either temporary or other than temporary impairments of our ars holdings 
we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until a successful auction occurs and the arss are liquidated at par value 
if in the future we determine that any decline in value of the arss is other than temporary  we would be required to recognize the loss in our statement of operations  which could have a material impact on our operating results in the period it is recognized 
further  as the funds associated with the arss may not be accessible for longer than twelve months because of continued failed auctions or our inability to find a buyer outside of the auction process  we may classify these securities as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of march   or thereafter 

table of contents the following table provides information about our investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows in thousands and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
december  investments at fair value weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange 
a significant portion of our operations is conducted through operations in countries other than the united states 
revenues from our international operations that were recorded in us dollars represented approximately of our total international revenues during the year ended december  substantially all of the remainder of our revenues was from sales in euros  british pounds and japanese yen 
since we conduct our business in us dollars  our main exposure  if any  results from changes in the exchange rate between these currencies and the us dollar 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
our policy is to reduce exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by having most of our assets and liabilities  as well as most of our revenues and expenditures  in us dollars  or us dollar linked 
therefore  we believe that the potential loss that would result from an increase or decrease in the exchange rate is immaterial to our business and net assets
