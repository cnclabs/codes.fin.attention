overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics for use in oncology and other serious diseases 
we have built our product candidate portfolio through internal discovery and the in licensing of novel cancer therapeutics 
we are advancing product candidates through in house research and development efforts and strategic collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and academic institutions 
from our incorporation in through  our operations consisted primarily of developing and refining our drug discovery technologies 
since  we have focused on the discovery and development of novel small molecule drugs 
in august  we announced a reduction in our workforce and implemented a revised operating plan to streamline our operations and extended our financial resources 
our reorganization was completed by year end 
we are currently advancing three proprietary oncology product candidates  sns  sns and sns  through in house research and development efforts 
our lead product candidate  sns  is a novel naphthyridine analog 
with sns  we are currently conducting one phase single agent clinical trial in advanced platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients and one phase b combination clinical trial with cytarabine in patients with refractory or relapsed aml 
a phase single agent study in advanced acute leukemias is continuing to treat patients  but enrollment was completed in in addition  we are planning to initiate a phase single agent trial in elderly patients with previously untreated aml in the first half of this year 
our second product candidate  sns  is a potent and selective inhibitor of cdks  and we currently are conducting a phase clinical trial with sns in patients with relapsed or refractory cll or mm 
we are also developing sns  a potent and selective inhibitor of the aurora a  b and c kinase enzymes 
sns is being studied in a phase dose escalating clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors 
we have worldwide development and commercialization rights to sns  sns for diagnostic and therapeutic applications and sns in the future  we plan to enter into collaborations for one or more of these product candidates in order to maximize the commercial potential of these programs 
we have developed a proprietary method of discovering drugs in pieces  or fragments 
we call this fragment based discovery approach was called tethering 
we have combined tethering with other drug discovery tools  such as structure based design and medicinal chemistry  to discover and develop novel therapeutics for major diseases 
we have an ongoing strategic collaboration with biogen idec to discover and develop small molecules that inhibit certain oncology kinase targets 
the research phase of this collaboration  which involves active participation by our personnel  expires in august the tethering approach to drug discovery formed the basis of our three other ongoing collaborations  one with johnson johnson prd and two with merck 
in those three collaborations  we are no longer receiving research funding  and our personnel are not actively participating in continued development 
as of december   we had received an aggregate of approximately million in cash from our current and former collaboration partners in the form of stock purchase proceeds and fees 
we have developed further enhancements to our fragment based discovery platform that are currently being used to discover new targeted agents and that could form the basis of future discovery collaborations 
we also have an ongoing research collaboration with the mmrc to evaluate the preclinical activity of sns in multiple myeloma relevant models and in primary disease tissue 
this collaboration is being performed by investigators at leading academic research institutions including university health network princess margaret hospital  dana farber cancer institute  h 
lee moffitt cancer center research institute  mayo clinic cancer center and emory university 
we believe that this and our other research arrangements with investigators at academic institutions help us to leverage and expand our internal research and development capabilities 
in addition  we have licensed worldwide rights to all of our lfa patents and related know how to sarcode 
since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  including a deemed dividend of million recorded in conjunction with our ipo in september we expect our significant net losses to continue for the foreseeable future  as we continue our research activities and conduct development of  and seek regulatory approvals for  our product candidates 
financial operations overview revenues we have not generated any revenue from sales of commercial products and do not expect to generate any product revenue for the foreseeable future 
to date  our revenue has consisted of collaboration revenue  license revenue and grant and fellowship revenue 
collaboration revenue 
we generate revenue primarily through our collaborations 
as of february  we had four ongoing strategic collaborations  only one of which currently involves research funding and active participation by our personnel 
each of these collaborations included a technology access fee  research funding  milestone payments and royalties upon sales of future products that may result from the collaboration 
the table below sets forth our revenue since january  from each of our current collaborators 
year ended december  in thousands biogen idec a related party    merck    johnson johnson prd  total    the research phase  and research funding  from the biogen idec collaboration expires in august the research phases for each of the other collaborations is completed 
in  we expect to receive research funding from biogen idec totaling approximately million 
this funding is discretionary  but is not dependent upon the achievement of milestones 
in addition  we may receive milestone payments if one or more of our collaboration programs reach a milestone for which a payment is due 
milestone payments earned under collaborations totaled million in and million in in the absence of any new collaborations  we expect to have no research funding after august  in which case our overall collaboration revenue will be substantially lower in future years  unless and until any products that may result from the collaborations advance to a level where significant milestones will be payable to us 
grant and fellowship revenue 
grant and fellowship revenue is recognized as we perform services under the applicable grant 
since inception  we had been awarded an aggregate of million in federal grants  and had recognized million as revenue from such grants and other significantly smaller grants and fellowships 
total grant and fellowship revenues for the periods ended december  and was million 
there was no grant and fellowship revenue recognized in and we do not expect to recognize any grant and fellowship revenue in future years 
license revenue 
in  pursuant our out license agreement with sarcode  we recognized a million license fee 
we also received two notes convertible into preferred stock of sarcode  one in the amount of million and the other in the amount of million which were not recorded due to uncertainty of collectibility 
under that agreement  we may receive up to an additional million in convertible notes  million in development and marketing milestone payments  and royalties for the commercialization  if any  of a licensed compound 
operating expenses research and development expense 
most of our operating expenses to date have been for research and development activities 
research and development expense primarily represents costs incurred in the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics and the advancement of product candidates towards clinical trials  including the phase and phase clinical trial costs for sns and the phase clinical trial costs for sns and sns  in the development of our proprietary fragment based tethering drug discovery approach and other novel fragment based drug discovery methods  in the development of in house research  preclinical study and development capabilities  in connection with in licensing activities  and in the conduct of activities we are required to perform in connection with our strategic collaborations 
we expense all research and development costs incurred 
the table below sets forth our research and development expense annually since january  year ended december  in thousands sns    other kinase inhibitors    sns    discovery programs and new technologies    sns    raf kinase inhibitors   other programs bace inhibitors for alzheimer s disease  tnf family and oncology research cathepsin s inhibitors anti viral inhibitors total    we incur research and development expense associated with both our internal research and development activities and in the conduct of activities we are required to perform in connection with our strategic collaborations 
each of our collaborations has involved research funding to us which substantially offset the related research and development expenses 
research and development expense relating to our collaborations with biogen idec  johnson johnson prd and merck consist primarily of costs related to tethering  lead optimization  preclinical studies and other activities related to the identification and optimization of compounds for development 
under our biogen idec agreement  we have an option on a target by target basis to co fund post phase development costs for product candidates directed to up to two collaboration targets  which may  at our option  include the raf kinase target 
if we exercise our option on one or more product candidates  our research and development expense will increase significantly 
we expect that research and development expense related to co development activities that we might elect to co fund would consist primarily of manufacturing costs for the product candidate  clinical trial related costs  costs for consultants and contract research organizations  employee and facilities costs and depreciation of equipment 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial research and development expense to conduct clinical trials on sns  sns and sns clinical trials are costly  and as we continue to advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development  we expect our related expenses to remain high 
for example  we expect to spend at least million i to advance our sns program to completion of the current phase clinical trial in ovarian cancer  the current phase b combination trial in aml and the planned phase aml clinical trial  ii to advance our sns program to completion of our ongoing phase clinical trial  and iii to complete the ongoing phase clinical trial for sns as of the date of this report  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early state of development of our programs  we are unable to estimate the additional substantial costs we will incur in any continued development of our product candidates for potential commercialization 
in addition  while we are currently focused on advancing sns  sns and sns through clinical development  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  an assessment as to the product candidate s commercial potential and our overall financial objectives 
this will affect our research and development expense going forward 
we also cannot forecast which product candidates will be subject to future collaborative or licensing arrangements  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
general and administrative expense 
our general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in finance  human resources  facilities management  legal  including intellectual property management and general administration  as well as non cash stock based compensation 
other significant costs include facilities costs and fees paid to outside legal advisors and auditors 
in  we expect general and administrative expenses to remain approximately the same as in restructuring expenses 
in the third quarter of  we implemented a revised operating plan to focus our efforts on generating data from our lead programs while streamlining our operations and extending our financial resources 
expenses incurred under the restructuring included severance and related benefit costs  facility related expenses and asset related impairment 
as a result  in  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
if we engage in similar restructuring activities in the future  we may be subject to similar  or possibly higher  restructuring charges 
for a full description of our restructuring actions in  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in  we expect to record an additional million of restructuring charges  primarily related to facilities costs 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf   accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which we adopted effective july   revenue arrangements with multiple deliverable items are divided into separate units of accounting based on whether certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
we allocate the consideration we receive among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair value  and we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria to each of the separate units 
where an item in a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables does not constitute a separate unit of accounting and for which delivery has not occurred  we defer revenue until the delivery of the item is completed 
we record upfront  non refundable license fees and other fees received in connection with research and development collaborations as deferred revenue and recognize these amounts ratably over the relevant period specified in the agreements  generally the research term 
we recognize research funding related to collaborative research with our collaboration partners as the related research services are performed 
this funding is normally based on a specified amount per full time equivalent employee per year 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments  which are substantially at risk at the time the collaboration agreement is entered into and performance based at the date of the collaboration agreement  upon completion of the applicable milestone events 
we intend to recognize any future royalty revenue based on reported product sales by third party licensees 
we recognize grant revenue from government agencies and private research foundations as the related qualified research and development costs are incurred  up to the limit of the prior approval funding amounts 
clinical trial accounting we record accruals for estimated clinical trial costs  comprising payments for work performed by contract research organizations and participating clinical trial sites 
these costs may be a significant component of future research and development expense 
we accrue costs for clinical trials performed by contract research organizations based on estimates of work performed under the contracts 
costs of setting up clinical trial sites for participation in trials are expensed immediately 
costs related to patient enrollment are accrued as patients are entered in the trial reduced by an initial payment made to the hospital when the first patient is enrolled 
these cost estimates may or may not match the actual costs incurred for services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate costs associated with various trials at a given point in time 
although our experience in estimating these costs is limited  the difference between accrued expenses based on our estimates and actual expenses have not been material to date 
stock based compensation we grant options to purchase common stock to our employees  directors and consultants under our stock option plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of common stock at percent of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning of an offering period or at the purchase date under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  which supersedes the previous accounting under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
upon adoption of fas r  we retained our method of valuation for share based awards granted using the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation 
fas r requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits related to tax deductions in excess of the compensation costs recognized for these options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
on november   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation pursuant to fas r 
the alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation  which is available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of fas r 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurement 
sfas requires prospective application for the fiscal year ending december  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected would be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements in order to facilitate comparisons between entities choosing different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas does not affect existing accounting requirements for certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and is required to be adopted by us for the fiscal year ending december  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf requires nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense when the related goods are delivered or services are performed 
eift is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt eitf in the first quarter of and do not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf  accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property eitf 
eitf discusses the appropriate income statement presentation and classification for the activities and payments between participants in arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property 
the sufficiency of disclosure related to these arrangements is also specified 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt eitf in the first quarter of and currently do not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to million in from million in collaboration revenue decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to a million decrease in collaboration revenue from merck in  offset by a million increase in collaboration revenue from biogen idec in and million in license revenue from sarcode in the decrease in collaboration revenue from merck resulted primarily from the fact that a million milestone payment was paid by merck in  as compared to a milestone payment of million in the million increase in collaboration revenue from biogen idec resulted primarily from increased payments for scientific personnel working on the collaboration 
the license revenue from sarcode resulted from the out licensing of our previously discontinued lfa inhibitor program 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased to million in from million in research and development expense associated with sns increased to million in from million in due to increased clinical trial activity 
research and development expense for discovery programs and new technologies increased to million in from million in due to increased work on our proprietary technologies and discovery programs 
research and development expense associated with sns decreased to million in from million in primarily because expense included a million non cash license payment 
research and development expense associated with sns decreased to million in from million in due to a reduced number of research employees working on this program  partially offset by increased outside services expense related to clinical studies 
research and development expense for all other programs decreased to million in from million in due to a decrease in expenses related to raf and other kinase inhibitor programs 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to i a million increase in employee related expenses  ii million increase in non cash stock based compensation expense  and iii a million increase in office and related expenses  primarily from computer and software expenditures  which were partially offset by a million decrease in professional services expense 
restructuring charge 
in  we recorded a million restructuring charge related to the restructuring plan announced and implemented in august the restructuring charge consists of i million in severance and related personnel termination costs  ii million related to the extension of option exercise periods to months for terminated employees  iii a million write off of leasehold improvements  and iv a million accrual for lease obligations for a facility that we are currently not utilizing 
cash restructuring costs totaled approximately million  or percent of the million restructuring charge 
interest income and expense 
interest income decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the decrease was partially offset by higher interest rates 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to the recognition of million non cash interest expense in related to our venture loan with oxford finance corporation and horizon technology funding company llc in years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to million in from million in collaboration revenue decreased to million in from million in the decreases in revenue were primarily due to a million decrease in collaboration revenue from biogen idec and a million decrease in collaboration revenue from johnson johnson prd 
the decrease in collaboration revenue from biogen idec and johnson johnson prd resulted from the completion of the research phase of collaborations with these companies in in the case of biogen idec  in connection with the tnf collaboration which is no longer ongoing 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased to million in from million in research and development expense for such years includes an million expense related to the in license of sns in and a million milestone payment paid for sns in without these non cash expenses for sns  research and development expenses increased to million in from million in primarily due to i a million increase in expenses related to the development of sns  ii a million increase in other expenses related to the development of sns  iii a million increase in expenses in other programs  including other kinase inhibitors program  and iv a million increase in expense associated with discovery programs and new technologies  partially offset by a million decrease in expenses associated with our sns program and million decrease in expenses associated with our bace inhibitors program 
research and development expense associated with sns increased to million in from million in due to increased clinical trial activity 
research and development expense associated with sns increased from million in  adjusted for licensing fees  to million in  adjusted for a million milestone payment  due to increased clinical trial activity 
research and development expense associated with sns decreased from million in to million in due to a reduced number of research employees working on this program  partially offset by increased outside services expense related to toxicology studies 
research and development expense associated with bace inhibitors decreased to million in from million in due to the end of the research portion of the collaboration in discovery programs and new technologies expenses increased to million in from million in due to increased work on our proprietary technologies 
research and development expense for all other programs including our other kinase inhibitors program increased to million in from million in primarily due to increased expense related to research activities on several other kinase targets 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to i a million expense related to the adoption of fas r in  ii a million increase in employee related expenses  iii a million increase in professional services expenses  including expenses related to managing our intellectual property portfolio and management s testing of internal control for financial reporting  and iv a million increase in other expenses  including costs for directors and officers liability insurance and facilities costs 
interest income and expense 
interest income increased to million in from million in  primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to a reduction in average debt outstanding in compared to  partially offset by higher average interest rates on outstanding debt obligations in than in income taxes since inception  we have incurred operating losses and  accordingly  have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of million 
if not utilized  the federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  and the state net operating loss will expire beginning in the state research and development tax credit carryforwards do not expire 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credits carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  that are applicable if we experience a substantial ownership change  which may occur  for example  as a result of the ipo and other sales of our stock  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
if a change in our ownership is deemed to have occurred or occurs in the future  our ability to use our net loss carryforwards in any year may be limited 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of common and preferred stock  research funding technology  access fees and milestone payments from our collaboration partners  research grants  loans from biogen idec and other debt financings 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and outstanding equipment financing of million 
cash flows net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to cash used of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net cash used in operating activities for resulted primarily from a net loss of million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by adjustment for non cash items of million and restructuring charges of million resulting from a reduction in force as part of our restructuring plan 
net cash used in operating activities for resulted primarily from net loss of million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by an adjustment for non cash items of million and a non cash milestone payment of million related to the in license of sns net cash used in operating activities for resulted primarily from a net loss of million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by adjustment for non cash items of million and a non cash license payment of million related to the in license of sns net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to cash used of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net cash provided by investing activities for resulted primarily from net proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable maturities of million  partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
net cash used in investing activities for primarily reflects net purchases of marketable securities of million and capital expenditures of million 
net cash used in investing activities for primarily reflects net purchases of marketable securities of million and capital expenditures of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and million in the lower net cash provided by financing activities in compared to primarily resulted from lower net proceeds from issuance of common stock of million in in a public offering compared to million in  partially offset by higher borrowing on equipment loans net of payments of million 
the net cash provided by financing activities in primarily resulted from net proceeds of million from the private placement of common stock and warrants completed in march and the million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock to employees  offset by the net payments of million on equipment loans 
the net cash provided by financing activities in primarily resulted from net proceeds of million from the public offering of common stock completed in september  offset by the payments of million on notes payable and equipment loans 
credit and loan arrangements in june  we entered into an equipment financing agreement with general electric capital corporation gecc 
various credit lines have been issued under the financing agreement since the current million credit line is available through march  we expect to enter into a new loan to cover our financing needs prior to that time 
as of december   our outstanding debt balance was million 
in  our interest rates on this debt balance ranged from percent to percent per annum  and were due in to monthly payments 
the equipment loans are secured by the equipment financed 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants in the gecc agreement 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
we will not receive any product revenue until a product candidate has been approved by the fda or similar regulatory agency in other countries and has been successfully commercialized 
we currently anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and available credit facilities  together with revenue generated from our collaborations  will be sufficient to fund our operations through approximately the middle of however  we will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our operations and bring future products to market 
we cannot be certain that any of our programs will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to complete the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates currently in development  should they succeed 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate in licensing and acquisition opportunities to gain access to new drugs or drug targets that would fit with our strategy 
any such transaction would likely increase our funding needs in the future 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities  the costs associated with establishing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities  the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses  product candidates and technologies  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the economic and other terms and timing of any collaboration  licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or strategic collaborations 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs 
in addition  we may have to partner one or more of our product candidate programs at an earlier stage of development  which would lower the economic value of those programs to us 
contractual obligations the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due as of december  in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years more than years equipment lease obligations   operating lease obligations     total      the contractual summary above reflects only payment obligations that are fixed and determinable 
we have additional contractual payments obligations relating to clinical trial milestones and product candidate development that are contingent on future events 
our operating lease obligations relate to the lease for our two facilities in south san francisco  california 
in may  we entered into a noncancellable operating lease for our main office which expires in june  subject to our option to extend the lease through june in addition  in december  we leased approximately  square feet of additional office space in a building near our main office 
this lease expires in april we vacated this building due to our restructuring in and are currently seeking a tenant to sublease this building 
see note to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the lease for additional office space provides for million in lease payments in each of      and million thereafter 
we also have agreements with clinical sites  and contract research organizations for the conduct of our clinical trials 
we generally make payments to these sites and organizations based upon the procedures to be performed in the clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled and the period of follow up required for patients in the trial 
off balance sheet arrangements through the year ended december   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
by policy  we minimize risk by placing our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer  limit duration by restricting the term and hold investments to maturity except under rare circumstances 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and corporate debt securities 
our investment policy prohibits investments in derivative instruments 
we did not hold derivative instruments as of december   and we have not held derivative instruments in the past 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december  included liquid money market accounts 
our marketable securities as of december  included readily marketable debt securities 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our portfolio as of december  for example  a percentage point increase in short term interest rates would reduce the fair market value of our portfolio of december  by approximately  the following table summarizes the maturity  fair value and average interest rate of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  maturity fair value average interest rate marketable securities various in  cash equivalents days or less
