item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background fuel tech  inc fuel tech has two broad technology segments that provide advanced engineering solutions to meet the pollution control  efficiency improvement  and operational optimization needs of energy related facilities worldwide 
they are as follows nitrogen oxide nox reduction technologies the nitrogen oxide nox reduction technology segment includes the noxout  noxout cascade  noxout ultra and noxout scr processes for the reduction of nox emissions in flue gas from boilers  incinerators  furnaces and other stationary combustion sources 
fuel tech distributes its products through its direct sales force  licensees and agents 
fuel treatment chemicals the fuel treatment chemicals technology segment uses chemical processes  including tifi targeted in furnace injection technology  to control slagging  fouling  corrosion  opacity  acid plume and loss on ignition  as well as the formation of sulfur trioxide  ammonium bisulfate  particulate matter pm  carbon dioxide and nox in furnaces and boilers 
fuel tech sells its fuel treatment chemicals through its direct sales force and agents to industrial and utility power generation facilities 
fuel chem programs are currently in place on over combustion units  treating a wide variety of solid and liquid fuels  including coal  heavy oil  biomass and municipal waste 
the fuel chem program improves the efficiency  reliability and environmental status of plants operating in the electric utility  industrial  pulp and paper  and waste to energy markets and offers numerous operational  financial and environmental benefits to owners of boilers  furnaces and other combustion units 
the key market dynamic for both technology segments is the continued use of coal as the principal fuel source for global electricity production 
coal accounts for approximately of all us electricity generation  with us government projections calling for an increase to approximately by coal s share of global electricity generation is forecast to be approximately by major coal consumers include the prc  the united states and india 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require fuel tech to make estimates and assumptions 
fuel tech believes that of its accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and are deemed critical 
fuel tech discusses its critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
revenue recognition fuel tech uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain long term equipment construction and license contracts that are sold within the nitrogen oxide reduction business segment 
under the percentage of completion method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual construction costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during the term of the contract  recognized sales and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
provisions are made for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 
fuel tech s construction contracts are typically six to twelve months in length 
a typical contract will have three or four critical milestones that serve as the basis for fuel tech to invoice the customer 
at a minimum  the milestones will include the generation of engineering drawings  the shipment of equipment and the completion of a system performance test 
as part of most of its contractual project agreements  fuel tech will agree to customer specific acceptance criteria that relate to the operational performance of the system that is being sold to the customer 
these criteria are determined based on mathematical modeling that is performed by fuel tech personnel  which is based on operational inputs that are provided by the customer 
the customer will warrant that these operational inputs are accurate as they are specified in the binding contractual agreement 
further  the customer is solely responsible for the accuracy of the operating condition information  all performance guarantees and equipment warranties granted by fuel tech are void if the operating condition information is inaccurate or is not met 
fuel tech has installed over units with the technology and has never failed to meet a performance guarantee when the customer has provided the required operating conditions for the project 
as part of the project implementation process  fuel tech will perform system start up and optimization services that effectively serve as a test of actual project performance 
fuel tech believes that this test  combined with the accuracy of the modeling that is performed  enables revenue to be recognized prior to the receipt of formal customer acceptance 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts fuel tech  in order to control and monitor the credit risk associated with its customer base  reviews the credit worthiness of customers on a recurring basis 
factors influencing the level of scrutiny include the level of business the customer has with fuel tech  the customer s payment history and the customer s financial stability 
representatives of fuel tech s management team review all past due accounts on a weekly basis to assess collectibility 
at the end of each reporting period  the allowance for doubtful accounts balance is reviewed relative to management s collectibility assessment and is adjusted if deemed necessary 
fuel tech s historical credit loss has been insignificant 
assessment of potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets effective january   fuel tech adopted fasb financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the guidance of this statement  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but rather  are required to be reviewed annually or more frequently if indicators arise  for impairment 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the carrying value 
fuel tech uses a discounted cash flow model dcf to determine the current fair value of its two reporting units 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce and working capital changes 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated 
however  actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
fuel tech reviews other intangible assets  which include a customer list  a covenant not to compete and patent assets  for impairment on a recurring basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates of future cash flows are made  however  the actual cash values that could be realized may differ from those that are estimated 
valuation allowance for deferred income taxes deferred tax assets represent deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at the end of each reporting period  fuel tech reviews the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
as part of this review  fuel tech will consider if there are taxable temporary differences that could generate taxable income in the future  if there is the ability to carryback the net operating losses or credits  if there is a projection of future taxable income  and if there are any tax planning strategies which can be readily implemented 
stock based compensation fuel tech recognizes compensation expense for employee equity awards ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
fuel tech utilizes the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of awards 
determining the fair value of stock options using the black scholes model requires judgment  including estimates for risk free interest rate an estimate based on the yield of zero coupon treasury securities with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option  expected volatility an estimate based on the historical volatility of fuel tech s common stock for a period equal to the expected life of the option  and expected life of the option an estimate based on historical experience including the effect of employee terminations 
if any of these assumptions differ significantly from actual  stock based compensation expense could be impacted 
recently adopted accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no
