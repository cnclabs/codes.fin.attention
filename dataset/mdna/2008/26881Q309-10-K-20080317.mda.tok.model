item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section has been derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing novel pharmaceutical products through the use of proprietary technologies to better diagnose  treat and manage patients 
we have four internally discovered therapeutic product candidates in clinical trials targeting conditions such as depression  alzheimer s disease  cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment 
our blood pool imaging agent  vasovist  is approved for marketing in over countries outside of the united states 
we also have collaborations with smithkline beecham corporation glaxosmithkline  amgen inc  cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics  incorporated  and bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
our business strategy is to develop our internally discovered  novel pharmaceutical products through the point of proof of clinical concept  typically completion of phase clinical trials and then to seek pharmaceutical partnerships for the continued development  regulatory approvals and world wide commercialization of the product 
table of contents candidates 
in certain disease areas  such as pulmonary hypertension  where we believe we can efficiently obtain regulatory approval and effectively market the product through a specialty sales force  we may seek to retain commercialization rights in the united states 
the focus of our therapeutic drug discovery and development efforts is on the two classes of drug targets known as g protein coupled receptors  or gpcrs  and ion channels 
gpcrs and ion channels are classes of proteins embedded in the surface membrane of all cells and are responsible for mediating much of the biological signaling at the cellular level 
we believe that our proprietary drug discovery technology and approach addresses many of the inefficiencies associated with traditional gpcr and ion channel targeted drug discovery 
by integrating computer based  or in silico  technology with in house medicinal chemistry  we believe that we can rapidly identify and optimize highly selective drug candidates 
we focus on gpcr and ion channel drug targets whose role in disease has already been demonstrated in clinical trials or in preclinical studies 
in each of our four clinical stage therapeutic programs  we used our drug discovery technology and approach to optimize a lead compound into a clinical drug candidate in less than ten months  synthesizing fewer than compounds per program 
we moved each of these drug candidates into clinical trials in less than months from lead identification 
we believe our drug discovery technology and approach enables us to efficiently and cost effectively discover and develop gpcr and ion channel targeted drugs 
on august   we completed our acquisition of predix pharmaceuticals holdings  inc pursuant to the terms of that certain agreement and plan of merger  dated as of april  as amended on july   by and among us  epix delaware  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  and predix  as amended 
pursuant to the merger agreement  predix merged with and into epix delaware  inc and became a wholly owned subsidiary of us 
the merger with predix was primarily a stock transaction valued at approximately million  including the assumption of net debt at closing 
as part of the merger  we also assumed all outstanding options and warrants to purchase capital stock of predix 
the purchase price included a million milestone payment to the holders of predix stock  options and warrants payable in cash  stock or a combination of both 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  million of the milestone was paid in cash on october  the remaining million of the milestone payment  including accrued interest  was paid on october  through the issuance of  common shares and the payment of million in cash 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  not all significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  research and development and employee stock compensation  as described below  require critical accounting estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue relating to collaborations in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s  or sec s  staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  or sab revenue under collaborations may include the receipt of non refundable license fees  milestone payments  and research and development payments and royalties 
we recognize nonrefundable upfront license fees and guaranteed  time based payments that require continuing involvement in the form of research and development as license fee revenue ratably over the development period  or based upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research contract 

table of contents when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  we estimate the period based upon other critical factors contained within the contract 
we continually review such estimates which could result in a change in the deferral period and might impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized 
milestone payments which represent a significant performance risk are recognized as product development revenue when the performance obligations  as defined in the contract  are achieved 
performance obligations typically consist of significant milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology  such as the filing of investigational new drug applications  initiation of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies and approvals by regulatory agencies 
milestone payments which are received at the time of initiation of a collaboration agreement or do not represent a significant performance risk are recognized ratably over the development period 
reimbursements of research and development costs are recognized as product development revenue as the related costs are incurred 
royalties are recognized as revenue when earned  reasonably estimable and collection is probable  which is typically upon receipt of royalty reports from the licensee or cash 
product development revenue we recognize as revenue from bayer schering pharma ag  germany costs incurred by us in excess of our obligation under the agreement to expend of the costs to develop vasovist 
this revenue is recognized in the same period in which the costs are incurred 
with respect to payments due to bayer schering pharma ag  germany  if any  in connection with the vasovist development program  we recognize such amounts as a reduction in revenue at the time bayer schering pharma ag  germany performs the research and development activities for which we are obligated to pay bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
on a quarterly basis  we calculate the revenue or reduction in revenue  as the case may be  with respect to the collaboration with bayer schering pharma ag  germany for vasovist as follows we calculate our development costs directly related to vasovist 
we obtain cost reports from bayer schering pharma ag  germany for costs incurred by bayer schering pharma ag  germany related to the development of vasovist during the same period 
we multiply our and bayer schering pharma ag  germany s development costs by approximately based on the contractual allocation of work contemplated under the agreement 
we then record the net difference as development revenue if the balance results in a payment to us and negative revenue if the balance results in a payment to bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
the result of this calculation is that we record revenue only for amounts we are owed by bayer schering pharma ag  germany in excess of of development expenses of the project in the particular period 
we record a reduction to revenue for any amounts owed to bayer schering pharma ag  germany in the particular period 
we also recognize as revenue from glaxosmithkline and cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics  incorporated certain third party costs incurred by us and internal development efforts in the performance of research activities under the related contracts 
internal development efforts are billed at standard rates under the contracts 
this revenue is recognized in the same period in which the costs are incurred 
royalty revenue we are entitled to receive a royalty on worldwide sales of primovist and on sales of vasovist outside of the united states by bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
royalty revenue is recognized based on actual revenues or gross profits as reported by bayer schering pharma ag  germany to us in the period in which royalty reports are received 

table of contents license fee revenue we record license fee revenue in accordance with sab  revenue recognition 
pursuant to sab  we recognize revenue from non refundable license fees and milestone payments  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the period during which we have a substantial continuing obligation to perform services under the contract 
certain contracts require judgment to determine the period of continuing involvement by us and these estimates are subject to change based upon changes in facts and circumstances 
when milestone payments are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligations associated with the payment are completed 
research and development we account for research and development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for research and development cost  which requires that expenditures be expensed to operations as incurred 
research and development expenses primarily include employee salaries and related costs  third party service costs  the cost of preclinical and clinical trials  supplies  consulting expenses  facility costs and certain overhead costs 
in order to conduct research and development activities and compile regulatory submissions  we enter into contracts with vendors who render services over extended periods of time 
typically  we enter into three types of vendor contracts time based  patient based or a combination thereof 
under a time based contract  using critical factors contained within the contract  usually the stated duration of the contract and the timing of services provided  we record the contractual expense for each service provided under the contract ratably over the period during which we estimate the service will be performed 
under a patient based contract  we first determine an appropriate per patient cost using critical factors contained within the contract  which include the estimated number of patients and the total dollar value of the contract 
we then record expense based upon the total number of patients enrolled in the clinical study during the period 
on a quarterly basis  we review the assumptions for each contract in order to reflect our most current estimate of the costs incurred under each contract 
adjustments are recorded in the period in which the revisions are estimable 
these adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations 
employee stock compensation we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  or sfas r  beginning january   using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  financial statements for periods prior to the adoption date are not adjusted for the change in accounting 
however  compensation expense is recognized  based on the requirements of sfas r  for a all share based payments granted after the effective date and b all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires us to make various judgments  including estimating the expected life of the share based award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the share based award and forfeiture rates 
in order to determine the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate is a less subjective assumption as it is based on treasury instruments whose term is consistent with the expected life of options 
we use a dividend yield of zero as we have never paid cash dividends and have no intention to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment 
estimating forfeitures also requires significant judgment 
our stock price volatility assumption is based on trends in both our current and historical volatilities of our stock and those of comparable companies 
we use the simplified method  as prescribed by the sec s sab no 
 to calculate the expected term of options 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience of cancellations of share based compensation prior to vesting 
we believe that our 
table of contents estimates are based on outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
to the extent actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  we will record an adjustment in the period the estimates are revised 
results of operations research and development overview research and development expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits and related expenses for personnel engaged in research and development activities  fees paid to contract research organizations to manage and monitor clinical trials  fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with preclinical studies  fees paid to access chemical and intellectual property databases  costs of materials used in research and development and clinical studies  academic testing and consulting  license and sponsored research fees paid to third parties  and costs of facilities and equipment  including depreciation  used in research and development activities 
we expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred 
we expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future preclinical and clinical development programs 
these expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
we test drug candidates in preclinical studies for safety  toxicology and efficacy 
we then conduct early stage clinical trials for each drug candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain drug candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising drug candidates 
we currently have one imaging product  vasovist  which is currently approved for marketing in more than countries outside of the united states 
in january  based on written confirmation from the us food and drug administration  or fda  regarding our protocol design and statistical analysis plan  we initiated a re read of the images obtained in prior phase studies 
as a result  future costs expected to be incurred for vasovist are currently limited to the costs of performing the re read of the phase clinical trial images and the submission of the results to the fda 
in connection with our acquisition of predix in  we incurred a nonrecurring charge of million for in process research and development 
the in process research and development charge represents the fair value of purchased in process technology of predix for research projects that  as of the closing date of the merger  had not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
the in process research and development primarily represents the estimated fair value of the following drug candidates prx million that  as of the date of the merger  was in a phase clinical trial for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder  prx million that  as of the date of the merger had completed phase clinical trials for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  prx million that  as of the date of the merger  had entered a phase clinical trial for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in association with copd  and prx million that  as of the date of the merger  had entered a phase clinical trial for the treatment of obesity 
the following summarizes the applicable disease indication and the current clinical status of active therapeutic drug candidates drug candidate disease indication clinical trial status prx ph copd phase a prx depression phase b prx alzheimer s disease phase a prx cognitive impairment phase b 
table of contents we completed a phase trial of prx in pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  or copd  in august this randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase trial enrolled patients with ph associated with copd 
patients were randomized to one of three arms  mg of prx once daily  mg of prx once daily  or placebo 
the two week double blind phase of the study was followed by an open label extension in which patients received mg daily for six weeks 
the primary endpoints of the trial were safety and tolerability of prx efficacy was measured by the effect of prx compared to placebo on systolic pulmonary artery pressure  or spap  and included evaluable patients who completed the double blind portion of the study 
in a population where decreases of mmhg to mmhg in a post exercise spap are considered clinically significant  the results showed a statistically significant dose response for the patients that demonstrated a decrease of mmhg or more 
in the mg dose group  of the patients had a reduction in post exercise spap of mmhg or more versus on placebo p 
an analysis of spap changes in all subjects revealed a dose trend with median reductions of mmhg and mmhg in the mg and mg dose groups  respectively  compared with no change on placebo 
prx was generally well tolerated 
there were no serious adverse events considered related to prx  and the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in nature 
one subject in the mg dose group who then continued into the six week open label extension experienced a modest increase in liver enzyme levels at the end of the extension that was believed to be drug related 
these values returned to normal within two weeks and the subject remained asymptomatic 
we have discontinued clinical development of prx at a dose of mg once daily in generalized anxiety disorder and are currently focusing our development efforts for this drug candidate on depression 
in march  we initiated a phase b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of prx in patients with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder mdd who also have concurrent anxiety 
the randomized  double blind  placebo controlled trial completed enrollment in october  enrolling adult patients with mdd  and is designed to evaluate the effect of treatment with up to mg of prx twice daily for eight weeks as determined by change from baseline in the montgomery asberg depression rating scale madrs compared with placebo 
all patients randomized to the drug treatment began with mg prx twice daily  and would increase the dose  if tolerated  to a maximum of mg twice daily within the first week 
changes in the hamilton anxiety score ham a  clinical global impressions improvement scale cgi i and clinical global severity of illness scale cgi s were also measured 
results of the study are expected to be reported in march we completed a phase trial of prx alone and in combination with an approved drug for alzheimer s disease the cholinesterase inhibitor aricept donepezil in patients with alzheimer s disease in the fourth quarter of this randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  multiple ascending dose trial enrolled patients with mild alzheimer s disease 
patients were studied on prx across three dose groups of patients each mg once daily  mg once daily and placebo  or in a placebo controlled combination across five dose arms of patients each prx at    and mg with aricept mg once daily 
the two primary endpoints of the trial were to assess the safety and tolerability of prx in patients with alzheimer s disease when dosed orally once daily for days alone and in combination with donepezil  and to assess the effect of prx on brain wave activity  as was performed in the phase b clinical trial 
secondary endpoints of the trial included evaluating the pharmacokinetic effect of prx on aricept concentrations in patients with mild alzheimer s disease and assessing the effects of repeat doses of prx on a battery of standardized cognitive function tests  such as the alzheimer s disease assessment scale cognitive subscale adas cog 
efficacy results show that patients receiving mg of prx orally once daily as monotherapy achieved a mean point improvement on the adas cog versus a point worsening in patients on placebo 
this result corresponds to a p value of  which is statistically significant 
data for the patients on a mg dose of prx showed a point improvement on the adas cog 
the monotherapy dose response mg versus mg versus placebo was also statistically significant p 
adas cog changes in the combination arms of the trial were not statistically significant 

table of contents prx appeared to be well tolerated in this trial  both alone and in combination with aricept 
no serious drug related adverse events occurred during the trial 
in april  we completed a phase multiple ascending dose clinical trial studying the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics of prx administered once daily for days in a population of otherwise healthy obese adults with body mass indices  or bmi  between and kg m normal bmi is less than kg m prx demonstrated predictable pharmacokinetics with dose proportional increases in exposures  and a half life supporting once daily dosing 
signals suggestive of pharmacologic activity were observed for obesity with a greater proportion of subjects on drug experiencing weight loss during the one month period than subjects on placebo 
overall results on cognitive function as measured by the cogscreen test battery  showed a dose dependent trend for improvement 
for the predetermined cognitive endpoint that combines speed and accuracy  there was a statistically significant improvement at the mg dose once daily 
subsequently  an independent external analysis of the cogscreen test battery results confirmed a significant drug effect on cognition but was not able to confirm the dose dependent trend 
no dose limiting toxicity was identified  and no serious adverse events were reported 
in october  we completed a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase trial of obese  but otherwise healthy  adults 
findings from this study demonstrated that adults taking mg of prx twice daily for days had a weight reduction of an average of kg approximately pound  while adults on placebo gained kg approximately pounds during the same period  which was statistically significant p 
subjects in the study were not required to follow any pre specified diet or exercise program 
prx was associated with a statistically significant p reduction in serum leptin levels  a marker of fat stores in the body 
overall  only one of the subjects approximately on placebo lost any weight during the trial  while of the subjects approximately on prx lost weight 
prx appeared well tolerated and there were no serious adverse events reported 
an increase in corrected qt interval  or qtc  was apparent at the dose tested  however  with a mean increase over the duration of the study of milliseconds for the drug group versus a decrease of milliseconds for the placebo group 
the corrected qtc is a measurement of the qt interval  which is corrected for heart rate 
prolongations of the qtc are associated with an increased risk for potentially life threatening heart rhythms and so this measurement is an important index to measure during the development of new drugs 
in addition  of the population of adults  one patient on drug discontinued due to a rash that resolved rapidly 
there were no discontinuations on placebo 
in the prior phase trial where doses up to mg once daily were studied for days  no clinically meaningful prolongations of the qtc were noted 
the person trial  which was conducted in an outpatient setting subjects spent three nights of the total day trial as inpatients to accommodate measurements and physical examinations  included secondary endpoint measures to assess potential effects on body weight  hunger  satiety and exploratory endpoint measures of cognitive function 
an analysis of cognitive data in this study showed no difference between drug and placebo at a dose of mg twice daily 
accordingly  future studies in cognitive impairment are expected to utilize doses less than mg twice daily based on the study results and the positive data in cognition previously demonstrated in lower doses 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time can vary substantially according to a number of factors  including the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a drug candidate 
the cost of clinical trials  and therefore the amount and timing of our capital requirements  may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development  including  among others the number of sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  the number of patients that participate in the trials  
table of contents the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of results  and the efficacy and safety profile of the drug candidate 
we could incur increased clinical development costs if we experience delays in clinical trial enrollment  delays in the evaluation of clinical trial results or delays in regulatory approvals 
in addition  we face significant uncertainty with respect to our ability to enter into strategic collaborations with respect to our drug candidates 
as a result of these factors  it is difficult to estimate the cost and length of a clinical trial 
we are unable to accurately and meaningfully estimate the cost to bring a product to market due to the variability in length of time to develop and obtain regulatory approval for a drug candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials in our areas of focus are typically completed over the following timelines  but delays can occur for many reasons including those set forth above clinical estimated phase objective completion period phase establish safety in healthy volunteers and occasionally in patients  study how the drug works  is metabolized and interacts with other drugs years phase evaluate efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety years phase further evaluate efficacy and safety of the drug candidate in a larger patient population years if we successfully complete phase clinical trials of a drug candidate  we intend to submit the results of all of the clinical trials for such drug candidate to the fda to support regulatory approval 
even if any of our drug candidates receive regulatory approval  we may still be required to perform lengthy and costly post marketing studies 
a major risk associated with the timely completion and commercialization of our drug candidates is the ability to confirm safety and efficacy based on the data of long term clinical trials 
we cannot be certain that any of our drug candidates will prove to be safe or effective  will receive regulatory approvals or will be successfully commercialized 
in order to achieve marketing approval  the fda or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that our clinical data establishes the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates 
if our clinical stage drug candidates are not successfully developed  future results of operations may be adversely affected 
we do not budget or manage our research and development costs by project on a fully allocated basis 
consequently  fully loaded research and development costs by project are not available 
we use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects  and many of our costs are not attributable to an individually named project but are directed to broadly applicable research projects 
as a result  we cannot state precisely the costs incurred for each of our clinical and preclinical projects on a project by project basis 
we estimate that  from the date we acquired predix  august  through december   the total payments we made to third parties for preclinical study support  clinical supplies and clinical trials associated with prx  prx  prx and prx are as follows prx million prx million prx million prx million as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 

table of contents financial results years ended december  and revenue the following table presents revenue and revenue growth decline for the years ended december   and years ended december  increase increase revenue decrease revenue decrease revenue product development revenue royalty revenue license fee revenue total our revenue to date has consisted principally of product development revenue under our collaboration agreements with glaxosmithkline  cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics  incorporated  or cfft  and bayer schering pharma ag  germany for imaging research and development programs  from license fee revenue relating to our agreements with amgen  glaxosmithkline  bayer schering pharma ag  germany  cfft  covidien and bracco  and from royalties related to our agreements with bracco and bayer schering pharma ag  germany 
royalties from bracco concluded in the second quarter of product development revenue increased in the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily as a result of million of milestones achieved from our collaboration agreements with glaxosmithkline and cfft  as well as revenue from reimbursed research costs earned under both of these agreements 
the increases in revenue for was partially offset by decreases in revenue due to the completion of our imaging research programs with bayer schering pharma ag  germany in  as well as lower development revenue for vasovist 
the decrease in royalty revenue of in the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily due to a reduction in royalties on sales of multihance by bracco due to the expiration of patents 
future royalty revenue will consist solely of royalties on sales of vasovist outside of the united states and primovist  which are not expected to be significant 
license fee revenue increased in the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily as a result of an increase of million in the recognition of deferred revenue from the amgen and glaxosmithkline collaboration agreements 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in revenue of million from the recognition of the bracco license fee as this fee was fully recognized by june the deferred revenue from our amgen agreement was fully recognized in october when our research obligation ended 
research and development expense research and development expense of million for the year ended december  reflects an increase of from the prior year 
the increase in research and development expense during was primarily due to an increase in third party expenses associated with our clinical development programs of million during the twelve months ended december   as well as increased costs for the preclinical programs and internal costs which began after the predix acquisition was completed on august  clinical program costs incurred in the current year include costs for the phase b clinical trial of prx for depression  costs incurred for the recently completed phase a clinical trial of prx for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  costs incurred for the completed phase a clinical trial of prx for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in association with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and costs incurred for the completed phase b multiple ascending dose clinical trials of prx for the treatment of obesity and cognitive impairment 
the increased costs as described above were partially offset by 
table of contents the discontinuation of spending on imaging programs subsequent to the merger with predix 
spending during and for vasovist primarily involved costs related to our appeal to the fda and was not significant 
in process research and development charge in connection with our acquisition of predix in august of  we incurred a nonrecurring charge of million for in process research and development 
the in process research and development charge represented the fair value of purchased in process technology of predix for research projects that  as of the closing date of the merger  had not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
the in process research and development primarily represents the fair value of the following drug candidates prx million that  as of the date of the merger  was in a phase clinical trial for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder  prx million that  as of the date of the merger had completed phase clinical trials for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  prx million that  as of the date of the merger  had entered a phase clinical trial for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in association with copd  and prx million that  as of the date of the merger  had entered a phase clinical trial for the treatment of obesity 
since the merger we have spent  and anticipate that we will continue to spend  a significant portion of our research and development budget on advancing these four drug candidates through additional clinical trials 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense of million for the year ended december  reflects an increase of from the prior year 
the increase in general and administrative expense during includes incremental costs associated with the increase in personnel and infrastructure relating to the predix business that was acquired on august  and higher legal expenses for patent related matters and general corporate items due to the increased complexity of the post merger entity 
in addition  includes nonrecurring legal and accounting costs of approximately million associated with our stock option investigation that was completed in the first quarter of royalty expense royalty expense of million for the year ended december  reflects a decrease of approximately million from the prior year 
the expense primarily consists of royalty payments made to ramot at tel aviv university ltd 
resulting from the receipt of milestone payments in from our collaboration partners 
the expense primarily consists of the royalty payment to ramot resulting from the payments we received from the execution of the glaxosmithkline agreement in december all of our current clinical stage therapeutic drug candidates  prx  prx  prx and prx  were  at least in part  identified  characterized or developed using the licensed technology acquired from ramot  and we are required to make payments to ramot  as described below  as and when rights to any such drug candidates are ever sublicensed or any such drug candidates are commercialized 
in addition  we have used the licensed technology in all of our preclinical stage programs  and would expect to make payments to ramot if rights to any drug candidates were ever commercialized from any of these programs 
we also are required to share between and of the consideration we receive from parties to whom we grant sublicenses of rights in the ramot technology or sublicenses of rights in products identified  characterized or developed with the use of such technology and between and of consideration we receive from performing services using such technology 
we would also be required to pay ramot royalties on sales of products developed with the use of such technology 
restructuring costs restructuring costs amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
restructuring costs for the twelve months ended december  include a restructuring charge of million recorded in the second quarter for the consolidation of a leased laboratory 
table of contents facility in cambridge  massachusetts into our lexington  massachusetts facility 
the charge consisted primarily of future lease costs through the end of the consolidation was completed during the second quarter of in addition  during the second quarter of  we recorded a reduction of our restructuring charge in the amount of million resulting from a reduction in the amount of space leased at our former headquarters location in cambridge  massachusetts 
restructuring costs of million for the twelve months ended december  include a charge of million recorded in the third quarter for the consolidation of our former cambridge  massachusetts headquarters into our lexington  massachusetts facility 
the charge primarily consists of future lease payments through the end of and the write off of leasehold improvements 
in addition  in the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of million that represented additional costs related to the december restructuring whereby we reduced our workforce by employees  or approximately  in response to the fda s second approvable letter regarding vasovist 
the reductions  which were completed in january  affected both the research and development and the general and administrative areas of the company and included severance costs as well as costs related to vacating certain leased space and the write off of leasehold improvements 
interest and other income interest and other income of million for the twelve months ended december  represents a decrease of from the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower levels of cash and investments available to invest due to cash being used to fund operations  partially offset by million received in from the settlement of a contract dispute 
interest expense interest expense of million for the year ended december  represents a decrease of from the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to a million decrease in the value of the embedded derivative relating to the stock portion of the milestone payable to the former shareholders of predix  partially offset by increased interest expense relating to the cash portion of the milestone payment 
prior to the payment of the milestone to the former shareholders of predix in october  we recorded interest expense on the milestone at the greater of the stated rate of or the value of the embedded derivative included in the milestone  which provided for the milestone payment to be paid in shares of our common stock based on of the day average closing price of our common stock ending on october  this embedded derivative was recorded at its fair value and changes in the fair value were recorded as interest expense 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents income taxes required to be withheld in italy on bracco royalties for multihance sales 
royalties on these sales were discontinued in the second quarter of years ended december  and revenue product development revenue decreased in the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily as a result of decreased reimbursement of imaging research and development costs due to our shift in focus from imaging agents to therapeutic drug candidates  and the completion of the clinical trials for vasovist 
this decrease was partially offset by revenue of approximately million in from the cfft program 
the decrease in royalty revenue of for the year ended december  compared to the prior year resulted from a reduction in the royalty rate on sales of multihance by bracco as total qualified sales of multihance exceeded a level established in the agreement and lower overall royalty eligible sales due to the 
table of contents expiration of certain patents related to the sublicense with bracco 
royalties from sales of vasovist in europe  which were first received in the third quarter of  were less than million 
license fee revenue increased in the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the recognition of deferred revenue from the amgen and glaxosmithkline agreements 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in revenue from the recognition of the bracco license fee as this fee was fully recognized by june research and development expense research and development expense of million for the year ended december  reflects an increase of from the prior year 
the increase in research and development expense during is primarily due to external expenses of million associated with the clinical development programs as well as costs for the preclinical programs and internal costs which began after the predix acquisition was completed on august  in connection with the predix acquisition  we shifted our focus away from the discovery and development of imaging agents to the discovery and development of therapeutics

table of contents revenue 
the net use of cash to fund operations for the twelve months ended december  primarily resulted from the net loss of million  which was partially offset by an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses largely resulting from increased clinical activity at year end 
during the twelve months ended december   we also received approximately million of landlord allowances related to the laboratory construction at our lexington  massachusetts facility

our primary sources of cash include quarterly payments from cfft and glaxosmithkline for research services and monthly interest income on our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities 
we do not expect the royalties received on non united states sales of vasovist to be significant in the near term 
other potential cash inflows include future milestone and option payments from our current strategic collaborators  glaxosmithkline  amgen  and cfft 
because of anticipated spending for the continued development of our preclinical and clinical compounds  we do not expect positive cash flow from operating activities for at least the next several years 
known outflows  in addition to our ongoing research and development and general and administrative expenses  include interest on our million convertible notes at a rate of payable semi annually on june and december and a milestone payment of million owed to covidien  in the event the fda approves vasovist 
the following table represents payments due under contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations  including interest payments operating lease obligations capital lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations other long term liabilities total we estimate that cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand as of december  and anticipated revenue we will earn in will fund our operations through the first quarter of our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress and 
table of contents scope of clinical and preclinical trials  the timing and costs of filing future regulatory submissions  the timing and costs required to receive both us and foreign governmental approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent to which our products  if any  gain market acceptance  the timing and costs of product introductions  the extent of our ongoing and new research and development programs  the costs of training physicians to become proficient with the use of our potential products  and  if necessary  once regulatory approvals are received  the costs of developing marketing and distribution capabilities 
in addition  if holders of our convertible senior notes require redemption of the notes  we would be required to repay million  plus accrued and unpaid interest  on june   and and upon certain other designated events under the notes  which include a change of control or termination of trading of our common stock on the nasdaq global market 
we may need to raise substantial additional funds to cover our future capital requirements through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances or otherwise 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  when we desire them  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  in accordance with our investment policy  we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally restricted to government sponsored enterprises  high grade bank obligations  high grade corporate bonds  high grade asset backed securities  and certain money market funds 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an insignificant change in the fair market value of our total portfolio at december
