item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under item a  part i  risk factors  and elsewhere in this form k 
we do not guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
we do not intend to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this document to conform them to actual results or to changes in our expectations 
overview we design  develop and manufacture advanced wafer probing and test socket solutions for the electrical measurement of high performance chips 
we design  manufacture and assemble our products in beaverton  oregon and plymouth  minnesota  with global sales  service and support centers in north america  europe  japan  taiwan  china and singapore 
we were incorporated and introduced our first commercial products in our products include engineering probe stations  analytical probes  production probe cards  test sockets  application software and services 
engineering probe stations address the need for precise and accurate measurement of semiconductor electrical characteristics during chip design or when optimizing the chip fabrication process 
our engineering probe stations are highly configurable and are typically sold with various accessories  including our analytical probes  as well as accessories from third parties 
in addition  we design and build custom engineering probe stations to address the specific requirements of our customers 
analytical probes are sold to serve as components of our engineering probe stations  or less often  to serve as components of test equipment manufactured by third parties 
our production probe cards are designed and sold for production test applications  ranging from very low current parametric testing to sophisticated  high speed radio frequency testing 
our test sockets are designed and sold for both production and engineering test applications  typically for high speed digital and radio frequency testing 
we refer to analytical probes  production probe cards and test sockets as consumables  as they are routinely replaced during the testing process 
we also generate revenue through the sale of service contracts to our customers 
our engineering probe stations  analytical probes and probing accessories are sold through our engineering products division epd 
our production probe cards and test sockets are sold through our production products division ppd 
to date  we have derived the majority of our revenue from the sale of our engineering probe stations  and we expect our probe stations to be our largest product line by revenue for the next few years 
our ppd revenue  however  increased as a percentage of total revenues in  due to the acquisition of gryphics  inc in april  compared to our engineering products business and operating results depend in significant part on the level of capital expenditures related to semiconductor research and development  which  in turn  depends upon current and anticipated market demand for chips 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply  which has often resulted in a reduction in demand for our products 
while our financial results are impacted by cycles within the semiconductor industry  we believe our business cycles are typically less pronounced than those of other semiconductor equipment companies 
we believe this is due to our greater reliance on our customers research and development capital spending and usage of test consumables rather than on our customers spending to increase production capacity 
capital spending aimed at increasing production capacity is one of the first areas in which most semiconductor manufacturers reduce spending in an industry downturn 
while the conversion to mm technology continues  high conversion costs combined with continued process developments on mm wafers continue to make sales of our sub mm probing systems 
table of contents an important component of our revenue stream for the foreseeable future 
mm technology more than doubles the available area on a wafer  significantly increasing the number of chips per wafer and reducing per unit manufacturing costs 
revenue from our mm engineering probe stations  including all probes  accessories and other items sold therewith  represented and of our total epd revenue in and  respectively 
in june  we announced our tesla system for characterization measurements of power semiconductors 
the tesla system is a mm platform aimed at the development of semiconductors that can handle higher currents  voltages and power densities 
tesla widens our offerings to include this important segment of semiconductors  which is growing faster than the average 
we booked and shipped our first tesla systems in the fourth quarter of in january  we announced our elite platform 
this next generation engineering prober is a major upgrade of our s system  and will support the next five years of semiconductor research and development 
we believe the new wafer stage technology in the elite enables mechanical accuracy  reliability and maintainability that is superior to anything else available in the market today 
we expect the enhanced performance of the elite to widen the segments we address within engineering probing by strengthening our offerings for design debug  failure analysis  wafer level reliability and emerging segments 
we sell our solutions to most segments of the semiconductor industry  including manufacturers of communications  wireless  microprocessors and other logic and memory chips 
a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from sales of our engineering probe stations and analytical probes to research and development laboratories of semiconductor manufacturers as well as to fabless semiconductor companies and academic institutions 
as a result  we sell to a geographically diversified customer base  with more than of our revenue in and generated from customers outside of north america  primarily in japan  other asian countries and  to a lesser extent  europe 
we sell our products both directly through our own sales force and indirectly through a combination of manufacturers representatives and distributors 
in north america and asia  excluding japan  taiwan  singapore  malaysia and portions of china  we sell most of our products through manufacturers representatives 
we sell certain products in these regions directly 
in japan  taiwan  singapore  malaysia and china  we sell through cascade microtech japan  kk  cascade microtech taiwan  cascade microtech singapore and cascade microtech china  our direct sales and service subsidiary and branch offices  respectively 
in most of europe  we primarily sell our epd products through distributors and manufacturers representatives and we sell our ppd products directly 
we also sell both our epd and ppd products directly in germany  austria  switzerland  china and taiwan 
our distributors normally place orders with us once they have received an order from an end user customer  and therefore  the total amount of inventory held by our distributors at any given date is not material 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenue

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report on form k for additional information 
revenue revenue increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in revenue in epd increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in certain financial information which contributed to the epd revenue results was as follows compared to compared to percentage increase decrease in unit sales percentage increase in average sales price 
table of contents average sales price includes the sales price of all analytical probes  probe cards and other accessories purchased with an engineering probe station 
the decrease in unit sales in compared to was due to an increase in sales of our mm systems being offset by a decrease in unit sales of our non mm systems 
the increase in the mm systems was due to increased customer demand 
as more customers transition to our mm systems  sales of non mm systems typically decline as a percentage of total system sales 
the increases in average sales price in compared to and in compared to were primarily attributable to increased unit sales of our mm systems  which have a higher average sales price than our non mm systems  and declining unit sales of our non mm systems 
in addition  in compared to  the average sales price for our non mm systems increased  contributing to the overall increase 
for compared to  although the average sales price increased overall  both the mm and the non mm average sales prices decreased 
these decreases were primarily due to sales of low end options selected on mm systems and more competitive pricing provided on multiple system orders in compared to these decreases were partially offset by the purchase of our higher end evue microscopes with many of the mm systems 
other epd revenue decreased in compared to and increased in compared to these changes were primarily due to fluctuations in stand alone analytical probe revenue 
stand alone analytical probe revenue fluctuates from period to period due to the mix of systems sold  the number of platforms requiring replacements and exchange rate fluctuations 
revenue in ppd increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in the increase in ppd revenue in compared to was primarily due to the addition of gryphics  inc during the second quarter of  which accounted for million of the increase 
during  we focused on rf and wireless applications for our probe cards  which contributed to a more diversified probe card customer base 
in  the top six customers represented approximately of probe card revenues compared to the top three probe card customers representing approximately of our probe card revenue in the increases in ppd revenue in compared to was due to an increase in the number of production probe cards sold  partially offset by a shift in mix to lower priced probe cards 
during the last several quarters  we have been adding probe card capabilities in the form of headcount and equipment 
although we expect to add additional equipment during the next few quarters  we do not anticipate significant headcount additions 
we have recently expanded our clean room space and increased our manufacturing capacity 
cost of sales and gross profit cost of sales includes purchased materials  fabrication  assembly  test and installation labor and overhead  customer specific engineering costs  warranty costs  royalties and provision for inventory valuation reserves 
fluctuations in gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  primarily result from changes in geographic mix  product mix  general pricing dynamics and yields in some of our production lines 
sales in europe typically have a lower gross margin than sales in north america and japan due to our use of third party distributors in europe 
within epd  we typically achieve higher gross margins on the consumables than on the engineering probe stations 

table of contents cost of sales  including stock based compensation  increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in the increases were primarily due to the following compared to increased direct costs  such as raw materials  resulting from changes in revenue and product mix increased inventory costs related to scrapping  obsolescence  revisions and returns increase in salaries and related costs in epd labor due to higher production activities and wage increases increase in supplies due to higher production volumes increase in salaries and related costs in ppd resulting from changes in headcount and other labor decrease due to costs allocated to finished goods inventory decrease due to increased allocation of costs to research and development expense due to increased research and development fab runs other decreases compared to increased direct costs  such as raw materials  resulting from higher revenue and changes in geographic and product mix increased inventory costs related to scrapping  discrepancies  obsolescence  revisions and returns increased freight expenses due primarily to more overseas inventory purchases and higher fuel costs increased salaries and related costs in ppd resulting from increased headcount and other labor increased stock based compensation other increases related to increased sales gross profit increased million  or  to million in compared to million in due primarily to the increased sales discussed above 
our gross margin increased to in compared to in the gross margin improvement was within ppd and resulted primarily from the inclusion of gross margin from gryphics  inc product sales beginning during the second quarter of  as well as increased fab run allocations to research and development expense 
the increase in the number of research and development fab runs resulted in an increase in research and development expenses and a decrease in cost of sales 
improved internal efficiencies  including shorter product lead times  better on time deliveries  shorter cycle times  higher yields  better scheduling and tracking  fewer design errors and better forecasts also contributed to the improved ppd gross margins 
the decrease in gross margin in epd in compared to was primarily due to the mix of product sales and some price discounts 
gross margin decreased to in compared to in this decrease was primarily attributable to additional costs incurred to ramp our production run rate and reduce lead times within ppd 
in addition  stock based compensation increased million in compared to  which resulted in an approximately percentage point decrease in gross margin in compared to we expect gross margins to be flat or slightly improve in compared to  due to various product line improvements  partially offset by product mix effects 

table of contents research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include compensation and related expenses for personnel  materials  consultants and overhead 
from time to time  we enter into arrangements that provide for the reimbursement of research and development expenses 
such reimbursements are netted against gross research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in we do not expect research and development expenses to increase significantly in compared to the increases were primarily due to the following compared to increase in salaries and benefits primarily due to increases in headcount increase in stock based compensation due to increased headcount and annual awards increase related to the increasing number of research and development fab runs increase in severance increase in prototype parts and design changes increases in other costs  including supplies compared to increase in salaries and benefits primarily due to increases in headcount increase in stock based compensation due to the adoption of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of increases in other costs  including supplies selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense includes compensation and related expenses for personnel  travel  outside services  manufacturers representative commissions  patent and trademark amortization and overhead incurred in our sales  marketing  customer support  management  legal and other professional and administrative support functions  as well as costs to operate as a public company 
sg a expense increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in the increases were primarily due to the following compared to increase in costs related to our china and taiwan sales offices  which opened in the second quarter of increase in salaries and related expenses due to increased headcount increase in it services  labor and other services due to international expansion demands increase in accounting fees increased stock based compensation due to increased headcount and annual awards increase related to recruiting costs for chief operating officer and german sales manager increase in severance due to reductions in workforce decrease related to decreased legal costs as a result of patent protection law suits filed in the first quarter of and generally lower activity in increase in costs related to establishing our german subsidiary other increases 
table of contents compared to increase in costs related to expansion and setting up direct sales offices in china  taiwan and singapore  including costs for labor and recruiting  offset by a decrease in representative commissions in these regions increase in stock based compensation due to the adoption of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of increase in legal costs primarily related to initiating litigation against third parties to protect against the infringement of our patents and corporate projects increase in it services  labor and software requirements for the network and expansion increase in representative commissions in regions other than china  taiwan and singapore and other sales expenses  primarily related to increased revenue amortization costs related to our acquisition of evue assets in the fourth quarter of increased marketing and sales expenses  including communications increase in human resources expenses increase in accounting fees  offset by lower sarbanes oxley costs other increases we expect that our sg a expense will increase slightly in as we hire additional international sales and support personnel 
amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization related to our acquisition of certain assets of the evue product line in the fourth quarter of  the acquisition of gryphics  inc in the second quarter of and the acquisition of certain assets of synatron gmbh in the third quarter of net purchased intangibles totaled million at december  and current amortization is approximately million per quarter 
other income expense other income expense typically includes interest income  interest expense  gains and losses on sales of investments and transaction and remeasurement related foreign currency gains and losses 
other income expense can also include other miscellaneous non operating gains and losses 
transaction related foreign currency gains and losses result from gains and losses recognized on foreign exchange forward contracts and on certain of our accounts receivable that are denominated in japanese yen 
interest income represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities and totaled million  million and million  respectively  in  and the decrease in compared to was due to the use of million  net of cash acquired  for the purchase of gryphics  inc in april and the purchase of certain assets of synatron gmbh in july and the use of million during for the purchase of fixed assets  partially offset by million of cash generated by operations  net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of million and million of cash from the sale of stock pursuant to our stock plans 
these decreases were partially offset by higher interest rates in compared to the increase in compared to was primarily due to higher average cash balances in compared to  as well as higher interest rates in compared to interest expense was  in  of which  was related to interest on our million note payable for the portion of the day prepayment notice period that occurred in january we gave notice of prepayment and prepaid the remainder of our million note payable and related interest in late december 
table of contents other  net was comprised of the following in thousands year ended december  remeasurement related foreign currency gains losses gains related to foreign currency hedges settlement income from a service provider other the settlement income from a service provider was fully recognized in the second quarter of and we do not anticipate any additional settlement income in future periods 
income taxes our provision for income taxes totaled million  or of income before income taxes  in  million  or of income before income taxes  in and million  or  of income before income taxes  in the effective tax rate differed from federal statutory rates primarily due to benefits from research and experimental tax credits  non deductible sfas no 
r stock based compensation and the non taxable income for federal tax purposes offset by increases to tax expense related to additions to tax contingencies recorded during the year and an out of period tax adjustment related to inter company sales and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses 
the effective tax rate differed from federal statutory rates primarily due to the benefit of non taxable interest income for federal tax purposes and the reinstatement of the research and development tax credit  offset by the non deductible sfas no 
r stock based compensation expense 
our effective tax rate differed from federal statutory tax rates primarily due to higher non taxable income for both federal and state income tax purposes  utilization of tax credits and the release of prior year valuation allowances since management believes the benefit of these credits is more likely than not to be utilized in future years 
deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet realized for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
at december   we had a net deferred tax liability on our balance sheet totaling million  primarily related to deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with the gryphics  inc acquisition  offset by deferred tax assets for reserves and research tax credits 
we are currently undergoing an irs audit and  in february  we received notification that the audit will disallow certain research and development credits on our returns for which we have not provided a contingency provision 
when a formal response is received from the irs we will determine whether we need to provide any additional tax contingencies in the first quarter of in addition  we may enter into a legal dispute with the irs over this matter and the costs could be significant 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we anticipate meeting our cash requirements for the next months and for the foreseeable future from existing cash  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities  which totaled million at december   as well as from cash expected to be generated from operations 
in  we used million of cash  net of cash acquired  for acquisitions as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million and consisted of net income of million  depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation of million and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities as described below 
accounts receivable  net increased million to million at december  compared to million at december   due primarily to an increase in our days sales outstanding 
in addition  a greater percentage of our revenue was in the last month of the fourth quarter of as compared to the last month of the fourth quarter of our days sales outstanding was approximately days at december  compared to days at december  inventories increased million to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to the timing of systems orders and shipments and the acquisition of gryphics  inc we believe that our inventory levels at december  are adequate given our revenue projections for the first quarter of deferred income taxes were a net liability of million at december  compared to a net asset of million at december  the change in deferred income taxes was due primarily to deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with the gryphics  inc acquisition 
net cash used in investing activities of million in resulted from million used for the purchase of fixed assets and million  net of cash acquired  used for the acquisition of gryphics  inc and certain assets of synatron gmbh 
these uses were offset by a net maturity and sale of marketable securities of million 
purchases of fixed assets primarily were for our ppd capacity expansion project 
we anticipate spending approximately to million in for fixed assets  primarily for ppd capacity expansion 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in resulted primarily from million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and million of tax benefits related to stock option exercises 
seasonality typically  our revenue is lower in our fiscal first quarter than in our fiscal fourth quarter preceding it 
in addition  as is typical in our industry  we recognize a large percentage of our quarterly revenue in the last month of the quarter 
contractual commitments the following is a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total and and and beyond operating leases capital leases purchase order commitments purchase order commitments primarily represent open orders for inventory 

table of contents critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
it is possible that the estimates we make may change in the future 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales to customers that do not have acceptance criteria  including product sales to distributors  is recognized when a written purchase order has been obtained  the product is shipped  title has transferred  no obligations remain and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  we ship our products fob shipping point 
for any shipments with fob destination terms  we defer revenue until delivery to the customer 
revenue from customers who have acceptance criteria beyond our standard terms and conditions is deferred until all acceptance criteria are satisfied 
revenue for installation services  consisting of assembly and testing  and for systems shipped to integrators is also deferred 
deferred revenue related to service contracts is recognized over the life of the contract  typically one to two years 
deferred revenue for systems shipped to integrators is recognized upon shipment to the final customer 
our transactions may involve the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated based on the fair value of each element 
a typical multiple element arrangement may include some or all of the following components products  accessories  installation services and extended warranty contracts 
the total sales price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component when sold separately 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on past collection history and known trends with current customers 
our estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur based upon changes in revenue levels  associated balances in accounts receivable and estimated changes in collectibility 
valuation of excess and obsolete inventory we regularly analyze the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including  but not limited to  the following forecasted sales or usage  historical usage rates  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements and new product introductions 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost computed on a first in  first out basis  or market and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventory is reviewed for obsolescence and excess quantities on a quarterly basis  based on estimated future use of quantities on hand  which is determined based on past usage  planned changes to products and known trends in markets and technology 
because of the long lived nature of many of our products  we maintain a supply of parts for possible use in future repairs and customer field service 
as these service parts become older  we apply a higher write down against the recorded balance  recognizing that the older the part  the less likely it will be used 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the value of inventory could materially change 
inventory write downs are recorded quarterly as a component of cost of sales 
lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets we evaluate the remaining lives and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if there is an indication of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the 
table of contents asset to its estimated fair value 
we have not recorded any impairment charges for long lived assets during  or warranty liabilities warranty costs include labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items  as well as other costs incidental to warranty repairs 
we estimate a liability for costs to repair or replace products under warranties ranging from days to one year and technical support costs when the related product revenue is recognized 
the products are sold without a right of return or price protection rights 
the liability for product warranties is calculated as a percentage of sales 
the percentage is based on historical actual product repair costs 
our estimated warranty costs are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
we anticipate our future warranty reserve accrual rate to be approximately of revenue 
changes to the reserve occur as volume  product mix and actual warranty costs fluctuate 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we record deferred tax assets for the estimated future benefit of research and development tax credits  foreign tax credits  net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences to the extent management believes these assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance is recorded when management can not reach the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
at december   we had gross deferred tax liabilities on our balance sheet totaling million  primarily related to deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with the gryphics  inc acquisition  offset by timing differences in the recognition of certain reserves and accruals 
the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets totaled million at december  we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of the unreserved assets will be realized 
we may record additional valuation allowances in the future 
uncertainty in income taxes on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
interpretation no 
applies to all tax positions accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with paragraph  we elected to continue to treat interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits as tax expense within our financial statements 
at december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of million  of which million would have an impact on the effective tax rate  and interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits were million 
although we cannot be certain of the final outcome of any ongoing tax examinations  we believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized benefits will decrease in the range of million to million within the next months 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  non vested stock and stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  we maintained our method of valuation for stock option awards using the black scholes valuation model  which has historically been used for the purpose of providing pro forma financial disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
the use of the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards requires us to make judgments on assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future 

table of contents compensation expense is only recognized on awards that ultimately vest 
therefore  we have reduced the compensation expense to be recognized over the vesting period for anticipated future forfeitures 
forfeiture estimates are based on historical forfeiture patterns 
we update our forfeiture estimates quarterly and recognize any changes to accumulated compensation expense in the period of change 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  our results of operations could be materially impacted 
new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we sometimes attempt to mitigate our currency exposures for recorded transactions by using forward exchange contracts 
the purpose of these activities is to reduce the risk that future cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
in some cases  we enter into forward sale or purchase contracts for foreign currencies  primarily the japanese yen  to hedge specific receivables and bookings positions 
as of december   we had contracts outstanding for the purchase of japanese yen totaling approximately million  which mature through january historically  we have not attempted to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the remeasurement of our subsidiaries net assets and results of operations  nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our forward exchange contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of sfas no 
 and  accordingly  gains and losses on our forward exchange contracts are recognized currently as a component of other income expense 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
as of december   we held cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million 
declines of interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our highly liquid short term investments 
a decrease in interest rates of one percent would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income related to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately  assuming our december  balances remained constant 
due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents  a change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we held long term fixed rate investments of million that consisted primarily of municipal obligations 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as we have classified our securities as available for sale and  therefore  may choose to sell or hold them as changes in the 
table of contents market occur 
declines in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our long term investments  as funds are re invested at current market interest rates
