critical accounting policies the following explains our most critical accounting policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements set forth on pages to of this form k for a complete description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on time and materials contracts as the services are performed 
time and materials contracts typically bill at an agreed upon hourly rate 
revenue is earned when our consultants are working on projects 
revenue recognition is negatively impacted by holidays and consultant vacation and sick days 
we also have fixed price arrangements with certain customers 
a price for an entire project is agreed upon for a predetermined fee before the project starts 
we recognize revenues on fixed price contracts using the proportional performance method 
we prepare a budget for each fixed price project  and based upon the budget that we prepare  we estimate what our costs should be 
we determine performance by comparing the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
we recognize revenue based upon costs incurred by our consultants during the period 
the company follows this revenue recognition method for fixed price contracts because there is a direct and consistent relationship between the service patterns and services provided to the customer and the direct costs incurred to provide such services 
if our cost estimates indicate a loss on a particular fixed price contract  we record a provision for the estimated loss without regard to the stage of completion 
changes in job performance  conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the changes are identified 
certain contracts with no stated deliverables  with a designated workforce assigned  recognize revenues on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
revenue on these contracts is ratable and predetermined based upon the negotiated contract 
accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts we extend credit to clients based upon management s assessment of their creditworthiness 
the majority of our revenues and the resulting accounts receivable are from large companies and major systems integrators 
unbilled receivables represent amounts recognized as revenues for the periods presented based on services performed in accordance with the terms of client contracts that will be invoiced in subsequent periods 

table of contents we review accounts receivable periodically to determine the probability of loss 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined using the combination of the specific identification method for balances deemed uncollectible  as well as judgments made by us based upon historical and expected charge off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be necessary  which may impact earnings 
investments the company accounts for its investments in marketable equity securities in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
if at any time the company has investments in marketable equity securities  they are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value  utilizing the investments closing price at each reporting period 
these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with the unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity and comprehensive income loss 
the unrealized gain or loss is the difference between the company s original cost for an investment and the investment s fair value at each reporting period 
realized gains or losses on securities sold are calculated using the specific identification method 
if management determines that an investment in available for sale securities has sustained an other than temporary decline in its value  the investment is written down to its fair value  by a charge to earnings 
such evaluation is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances 
factors that are considered by the company in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis  the financial condition of the investee  and the intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
in evaluating these factors above  management presumes a decline in value to be other than temporary if the market price of the security is or more below the investment s cost basis for a period of six months or more the criteria 
however  the presumption of an other than temporary decline in these instances may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature eg  strong operating performance of investee  historical volatility of investee  etc additionally  there may be instances where impairment losses are recognized even if the criteria is not satisfied eg  plan to sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below the company s cost basis 
for investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting  management evaluates information eg  budgets  business plans  financial statements  etc 
in addition to quoted market price  if any  in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of an investment 
this list is not all inclusive and management weighs all quantitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred 
in  the company recorded an impairment of million on its investment in concours  inc in  the company recorded an impairment of million on its investment in concours  inc there were no impairments recorded in goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually or as triggering events occur 
in making this assessment  we rely on a combination of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated cash flows and our current market value 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analyses of goodwill impairment 
under sfas  goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
estimated fair values of reporting units 
table of contents underlying the segments were estimated using either a discounted cash flow methodology  recent comparable transactions or a combination thereof 
for further discussions  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards  using a fair value approach as prescribed in sfas no 
r share based payments 
the impact is more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we record an estimated liability for income and other taxes based on what we determine will likely be paid in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters  including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions  and may differ from the amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the amount recorded 
we record an estimated liability on what we determine to be unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal and state income tax matters 
the difference between the total amount of the unrecognized tax benefits and the amount that would impact the effective tax rate consists of items that are offset by deferred tax assets and the federal tax benefit of state income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when assessing the need for valuation allowances  we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years  we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs  along with a corresponding increase or charge to income 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
all of the estimates that we make in preparing our financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which could impact our earnings
