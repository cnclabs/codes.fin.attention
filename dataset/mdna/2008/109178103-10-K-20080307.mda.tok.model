table of contents onshore gulf coast province our onshore gulf coast province is a high potential  multi pay province that lends itself to d seismic exploration due to its substantial structural and stratigraphic complexity 
in addition  certain sand reservoirs display seismic bright spots  which can be direct hydrocarbon indicators and can result in greatly reduced drilling risk 
however  bright spots are not always reliable as direct hydrocarbon indicators and do not generally assess reservoir productivity 
we believe our established d seismic exploration approach  combined with our exploration staff s extensive experience and accumulated knowledge base in the onshore gulf coast province  provides us with significant competitive advantages 
key operating trends within this province include the vicksburg trend in brooks county  texas  the frio trend in and around matagorda county  texas and the miocene and upper oligocene trends in southern louisiana 
in  we entered into two joint ventures in an effort to continue to expand our position in southern louisiana 
over the three year period ended december   approximately of our total capital expenditures for drilling  land and seismic were allocated to our onshore gulf coast province  where we completed gross wells net in attempts for a completion rate of 
during  we completed five gross wells net in eight attempts for a completion rate of in this province 
all of the completed wells were development wells 
we also had one exploratory well that was drilling as of december  subsequent to year end  we were in the process of completing this well 
we operated of the wells that we drilled in this province during for  we spent million on drilling  land and seismic in our onshore gulf coast province 
approximately of the drilling  land and seismic was allocated to the vicksburg  to southern louisiana  to the frio and to other areas in the province 
for  we currently plan to spend million in our onshore gulf coast province 
approximately million of this spending has been allocated to drilling  with the remaining million allocated to capital spending for land and seismic activities 
we anticipate that approximately of the drilling  land and seismic will be allocated to the vicksburg  to southern louisiana  to the frio  and to other areas in the province 
we plan to drill six development wells and spend approximately million on development drilling capital 
we also plan to drill five exploratory wells and spend million on exploration drilling capital 
vicksburg trend our vicksburg activity is focused principally in brooks county  texas  in our home run  triple crown  and floyd fields 
we discovered these fields in  and  respectively 
since  we have drilled vicksburg wells and we have completed of those wells 
we believe we have a multi year inventory of drilling locations in our home run  triple crown and floyd fault block fields 
in  we successfully completed all five of our development wells spud in of which three were in the triple crown field and two were in the home run field 
total drilling  land and seismic capital expended in the vicksburg during was million 
during  we operated all of our vicksburg drilling and the working interests we retained in our wells was higher than our historic average as our joint venture participant elected to take a more passive role in the development of the field 
rather than participating in the drilling of the wells with a paying working interest  our joint venture participant elected to receive a reversionary  or back in  working interest based on certain payout thresholds 
in march  we successfully completed the triple crown field dawson s from the dawson sand at an initial production rate of approximately mmcfe per day 
the dawson s was followed by the triple crown field sullivan c  which found pay in the brigham   loma blanca and dawson sands 
the well was brought on line at an initial production rate of approximately mmcfe per day from the  loma blanca and dawson sands 

table of contents in july  we completed the triple crown field sullivan  which encountered pay in the  and brigham sands 
the well was brought on line at an initial production rate of approximately mmcfe per day from the  sand 
the sullivan was followed by the home run sullivan  which was a test of the eastern extent of the home run field 
using new drilling technologies  the well was completed in a record days resulting in an estimated million reduction in drilling costs 
the well was completed from the vick sand at an initial production rate of approximately mmcfe per day 
given the successful completion of the sullivan  we immediately commenced drilling the home run sullivan c and found approximately feet of apparent pay in various lower vicksburg objectives 
the well was completed at an initial production rate of approximately mmcfe per day  with additional pay behind pipe for future completion 
subsequent to the c  we temporarily halted drilling in the vicksburg in order update our structural interpretation of the three fields  which are essentially one highly faulted structural feature  based on our recent drilling results and our recently reprocessed proprietary d data 
our recent sullivan and sullivan c completions in the home run field were drilled to confirm new interpretational ideas 
at the same time  we had commenced reprocessing the d seismic data over the fields and believed it was important to integrate the new processing and recent drilling results into a new interpretation of the fields and surrounding arrears 
during  we currently plan to spend approximately million in the vicksburg to drill four development wells and one exploration well 
we also currently expect to spend approximately million on land and seismic in in february  we resumed our continuous vicksburg drilling program and spud the floyd field sullivan c  a development well  which is an attempt to extend the prolific floyd fault block to the north 
as of march   we had reached an approximate depth of  feet 
we expect the c to reach a total depth of  feet and anticipate providing drilling results in april 
we will have a working interest in the well subject to a back in 
frio trend our frio trend drilling  land and seismic capital expenditures for totaled million 
during  we drilled one exploratory well in the frio  the randall the well was plugged and abandoned after encountering non commercial frio pay 
in  we currently plan to spend approximately million to drill one frio development well and for other activities 
capital costs on our frio well will be mitigated by a partial carry to casing point by industry partners 
southern louisiana trend in southern louisiana  we utilize our geophysical  geological and operational expertise to explore for hydrocarbon bearing oligocene and miocene reservoirs 
these reservoirs are generally on trend with the texas gulf coast frio and are therefore logical extensions of our drilling activities 
during  we drilled two wells and are in process of drilling another with drilling  land and seismic expenditures totaling million 
in january  we announced that that cotten land encountered feet of pay in the primary objective and feet of apparent pay in an unexpected shallower zone 
in march  the well commenced production at an initial production rate of approximately mmcfe per day from the primary objective 
the shallower pay continues to remain behind pipe for future completion 
also in march  we announced that the marie snyder commenced production at an initial production rate of approximately mmcfe per day 
this well proved to be an important control point as it extended the gas water contact in the cotten land fault block 
in may  we commenced the cotten land  which was in an adjacent fault block to the cotten land a primary upper sand objective was not present and the well was sidetracked 
the sidetrack was also unsuccessful and a decision was made to undertake a second sidetrack to target our cotten land objective in adjacent fault block  thereby realizing approximately million in cost savings versus drilling a new well 
the second sidetrack was plugged and abandoned as the target sands were wet 

table of contents in august  we entered into a drilling project to participate in at least two wells in jefferson davis and acadia parishes 
the two wells targeted d seismic delineated oligocene objectives at depths of  and  feet 
the first well  the blue heron  was plugged and abandoned late in the second well  the cary sr 
estate is currently being completed after encountering approximately feet of apparent pay at a true vertical depth of  feet 
results from this well are expected in late march in december  we entered into a joint venture to operate the drilling of at least six prospects over the next months with a working interest 
the five prospects planned for will target d delineated  primarily amplitude related prospects at depths of  to  feet in plaquemines and saint bernard parishes 
in  we currently plan to spend approximately million to drill four exploratory wells  one development well  to complete wells in progress at december  and for other activities 
we also currently expect to spend approximately million on land and seismic 
anadarko basin province the anadarko basin is located in the texas panhandle and western oklahoma 
we believe this prolific natural gas producing province offers a combination of relatively lower risk exploration and development opportunities in shallower horizons  as well as higher risk  but higher reserve potential opportunities in the deeper sections that have been relatively under explored 
we believe our drilling program in the anadarko basin generally provides us with longer life reserves and helps to balance our drilling program in our prolific  but generally shorter reserve life onshore gulf coast province 
the stratigraphic and structural objectives in the anadarko basin can provide excellent targets for d seismic imaging 
in addition  drilling economics in the anadarko basin are enhanced by the multi pay nature of many of the prospects  with secondary or tertiary targets serving as either incremental value or as alternatives if the primary target zone is not productive 
our recent activity has been focused primarily in the hunton  springer channel  springer bar and granite wash trends 
during  we drilled three development and two exploratory wells 
we successfully completed all three development wells and plugged and abandoned the two exploratory wells for an overall success rate of 
of the million that we spent on this province in  approximately was allocated to the hunton trend  was allocated to the granite wash trend  was allocated to the springer trends and to other anadarko basin projects 
during  we currently expect to spend approximately million to drill four development wells  one exploratory well  to complete wells that were in progress and on other activities 
we also expect to spend million on net land and seismic 
hunton trend our mills ranch commenced production in january from the viola and was producing approximately mmcfe per day prior to being shut in to complete the upper  middle and lower hunton objectives 
production from the hunton objectives began in mid march at an initial production rate of approximately mmcfe per day 
while production testing the well  it was determined that a substantial number of perforations were not contributing to the production stream and we undertook operations to open these perforations 
during this time  a tubing failure was identified that required remediation 
after completing the remediation  the well was brought on line in july at a production rate of approximately mmcfe per day 
granite wash trend in september  we announced closing on the sale of our granite wash divestiture package for net proceeds of million based on an effective date of september  the properties sold had current net production of approximately mmcfe per day and proved reserves at the time of sale of approximately bcfe 
year end proved reserves associated with the properties were approximately bcfe 
the granite wash properties were sold because the rates of return on the wells drilled in the granite wash over the last four years were not competitive with the rates of return on our other projects 
proceeds from the sale were initially used to pay off the outstanding balance under the credit facility and will eventually be used to fund other projects 

table of contents rocky mountains province we regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our activities to areas that may offer attractive exploration and development potential  with a particular interest in those plays that complement our current exploration  development and production activities 
in late  we began accumulating acreage in the williston basin located in north dakota and montana and in early entered into a joint venture agreement in the powder river basin located in wyoming 
during  we invested approximately million in drilling  land and seismic in the williston and powder river basins 
during  we spud wells in the province with four wells completing and two wells still drilling at year end 
we successfully completed the remaining six wells we spud during for an overall completion success rate of 
williston basin the williston basin is spread across north dakota  montana and canada with the united states portion of the basin encompassing approximately  square miles 
the basin produces oil and gas from numerous producing horizons including  but not limited to  the bakken and red river  which are currently our primary objectives 
the bakken is an unconventional oil play at depths of approximately  to  feet 
in richland county  montana  approximately bakken wells in the elm coulee field have generated average initial production rates of approximately barrels of oil per day and estimated ultimate recoveries of approximately  barrels of oil per well  based on data compiled from external sources 
in north dakota  oil and gas companies are rapidly accelerating their activity east of the nesson anticline with much of the activity focused in and around mountrail county 
in  we spud nine wells in the williston basin  eight of which targeted the bakken and one of which targeted the red river 
at year end  we were completing four wells  drilling one well and had successfully completed the four remaining wells for a success rate 
of the eight bakken wells spud during  four were operated by us  and four were non operated wells 
total drilling  land and seismic capital expended in the williston basin during was approximately million 
the bergstrom family trust h  which was our first operated well drilled in mountrail county  north dakota  produced at an early peak rate of approximately barrel of oil equivalent per day up casing and was drilled and completed for approximately million 
after installing production tubing and placing the well on rod pump  we indicated on march  that the well was currently producing approximately barrels of oil equivalent per day 
the bergstrom family trust h is located approximately miles northeast of the parshall field  and approximately miles southeast of eog s austin h and the austin h discoveries 
approximately miles to the northwest of the bergstrom family trust h  we successfully drilled and completed our second operated mountrail county  north dakota well  the hynek h 
the hynek h produced at an early peak hour rate of approximately boe per day up casing 
after installing production tubing and placing the well on rod pump  we indicated on march  that the well was currently producing approximately barrels of oil equivalent per day 
the hynek h was drilled and completed for approximately million 
we successfully drilled and completed our third mountrail county  north dakota operated well  the bakke h  which produced at an early peak hour rate of approximately boe per day up casing 
after installing production tubing and placing the well on rod pump  we indicated on march  that the well was currently producing approximately barrels of oil equivalent per day 
the bakke h is located approximately miles east of the hynek h  miles west of eog s recently announced austin h completion  and approximately miles northwest of our bergstrom family trust h 
the bakke h was drilled and completed for approximately million 
at year end  we were drilling our fourth operated mountrail county  north dakota horizontal bakken well  the hallingstad h 
the hallingstad h is located approximately one mile west of the bergstrom family trust h well 
on march   we indicated that after fracture stimulation the well was producing at an early rate of approximately barrels of oil equivalent per day up casing 
after completing the hallingstad h  we moved the rig to a location proximal to the hynek h to drill the working interest manitou state h 
as of march   the well was drilling at a depth of approximately  feet 
we currently plan to keep this operated rig running continuously in drilling horizontal bakken wells in north dakota 

table of contents in december  we successfully drilled and completed the richardson  a red river discovery  which commenced production at an initial production rate of approximately barrels of oil equivalent per day 
as of march   we indicated that the well was currently producing approximately barrels of equivalent per day 
the richardson is a conventional vertical well and was drilled and completed for approximately million 
we plan to commence our next red river test in april during  we currently expect to spend approximately million to drill wells  complete wells that were in progress and on other activities 
we also currently expect to spend approximately million on net land and seismic 
powder river basin in february  we signed a letter of intent to acquire a working interest in an unconventional shale play in the powder river basin located in wyoming 
eighteen vertical wells in the area  which date as far back as  targeted the approximate foot mowry shale at depths of about  feet and produced between to barrels of oil per day 
given the historical results  we believe the application of horizontal drilling technology and advanced fracture stimulation could significantly increase the productivity of the shale 
our obligations to carry our partners for the drilling and completion of two horizontal wells and million of land acquisition costs were fulfilled in resulting in us earning a working interest in approximately  net acres 
as of december   we hold approximately  net acres in the play  located primarily in niobrara county  wyoming 
in  we spent million in the powder river basin to complete one horizontal well that spud in  to drill and complete two new wells that spud in  to commence drilling a third well and to acquire land and seismic data 
the krejci h  drilled in  was our first well drilled in the powder river basin 
the well produced initially from the outermost feet of the wellbore and pumped between and barrels of oil per day 
in december  operations began to complete the innermost  feet of the wellbore and after fracture stimulation the well produced between and barrels of oil per day 
it appears that the outermost section of the uncased wellbore collapsed and therefore we are no longer in full communication with the section of the wellbore that was producing to barrels of oil per day rate 
the well is currently pumping approximately barrels of oil per day 
the krejci h was followed later in by the mill trust h 
in july  we fracture stimulated the foot cased portion of the wellbore and installed production tubing and pumping equipment 
the well is currently pumping approximately barrels of oil per day 
results after cleanout show a good possibility that he cased hole interval was not properly stimulated 
the werner h was the first well drilled in our powder river basin program 
in july  we fracture stimulated the wellbore and installed production tubing and pumping equipment 
the well is currently producing intermittently at barrels of oil per day 
the state h  the second powder river basin well in our drilling program  was spud in may the state h was completed in july and is currently pumping intermittently at approximately to barrels of oil per day 
a proper stimulation was never achieved in this wellbore and we are currently accessing the next plan of action 
in november  we spud the krejci federal h well  which is proximate to our first well in the basin  the krejci federal h 
the krejci federal h will be completed using swell packer technology  a method enabling the isolation of fracture stimulations along the lateral utilizing an uncemented liner 
completions utilizing swell packers have generated positive operational results in the horizontal bakken wells in the williston basin 
as of march   we indicated that the well had been drilled and swell packers had been installed 
we anticipate that the well will be fracture stimulated in mid march and anticipate results will be provided in early april in  we currently anticipate spending approximately million to complete the well that was drilling at year end  acquire additional acreage and conduct additional seismic delineation testing 
west texas and other province the permian basin of west texas and eastern new mexico is a predominantly oil producing province with generally longer life reserves than that of our onshore gulf coast 
our drilling activity in our west texas province has been focused primarily in various carbonate reservoirs  including the canyon reef and fusselman formations of the horseshoe atoll trend  the canyon reef of the eastern shelf  the wolfcamp and devonian section of new mexico  and the mississippian reef of the hardeman basin  at depths ranging from  to  feet 

table of contents during  we completed one gross well in two attempts for a completion rate and spent a total of million on drilling  land and seismic 
for  we currently plan to spend approximately million on drilling  land and seismic 
d seismic exploration we have accumulated d seismic data covering approximately  square miles million acres in states 
we typically acquire d seismic data in and around existing producing fields where we can benefit from the imaging of producing analog wells 
these d defined analogs  combined with our experience in drilling wells  the majority of which were imaged utilizing our d seismic data and interpretation  provide us with a knowledge base to evaluate other potential geologic trends  d seismic projects within these trends and prospective d delineated drilling locations 
through our experience in the early and mid s  we developed an expertise in the selection of geologic trends that we believe are best suited for d seismic exploration 
we have used the experience that we have gained within our core trends to enhance the quality of subsequent projects in the same trend and other analogous trends to help lower finding and development costs  compress project cycle times and enhance our return on capital 
over the last years  we have accumulated substantial experience exploring with d seismic in a wide range of reservoir types and geologic trapping mechanisms 
in addition  we typically acquire digital databases for integration on our computer aided exploration workstations  including digital land grids  well information  log curves  production data  geologic trend studies  formation reservoir top databases and existing d seismic data 
we use our knowledge base  local geological expertise and digital databases integrated with d seismic data to create maps of producing and potentially productive reservoirs 
as such  we believe our d generated maps are more accurate than previous reservoir maps which generally are based on subsurface geological information and d seismic surveys  enabling us to more precisely evaluate recoverable reserves and the economic feasibility of projects and drilling locations 
historically  we have acquired most of our raw d seismic data using seismic acquisition vendors on either a proprietary basis or through alliances affording the alliance members the exclusive right to interpret and use data for extended periods of time 
in addition  we have participated in non proprietary group shoots of d seismic data commonly referred to as spec data when we believe the expected full cycle project economics could not justify the acquisition of proprietary data 
further  we have exchanged certain interests in some of our non core proprietary seismic data to gain access to additional d seismic data 
in most of our proprietary d data acquisitions and alliances  we have selected the sites of projects  primarily guided by our knowledge and experience in the core provinces we explore  established and monitored the seismic parameters of each project for which seismic data was acquired  and typically selected the equipment that was used 
combining our geologic and geophysical expertise with a sophisticated land effort  we manage the majority of our projects from conception through d acquisition  processing and interpretation and leasing 
in addition  we manage the negotiation and drafting of virtually all of our geophysical exploration agreements  resulting in reduced contract risk and more consistent deal terms 
because we generate most of our projects  we can often control the size of the working interest that we retain as well as the selection of the operator and the non operating participants 
during  we added approximately square miles of d seismic data to our corporate database 
all square miles of d seismic data acquired were non proprietary to us 
included in the d seismic data that we added to our corporate database in was approximately square miles of data in our mudflats project located in the frio trend along the lower texas gulf coast 
we retained a working interest in our mudflats project 
during  we added approximately square miles of d seismic data to our corporate database 
approximately square miles of d seismic data was acquired on a proprietary basis and the remaining square miles was acquired on a non proprietary basis 
included in the d seismic data that we added to our corporate database in was approximately square miles of data from our proprietary laker project  which is in the hunton trend of our anadarko basin 
we retained a working interest in our laker project 
during  we added approximately square miles of d seismic data to our corporate database 
approximately square miles of d seismic data was acquired on a proprietary basis and the remaining square miles was acquired on a non proprietary basis 
included in our d seismic additions is approximately square miles of data in the williston basin targeting bakken and red river objectives offsetting and on trend with recent discoveries in the area 
we retained an approximate overall working interest in our d projects

title to properties we believe we have satisfactory title  in all material respects  to substantially all of our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry 
our properties are subject to royalty interests  standard liens incident to operating agreements  liens for current taxes and other burdens  which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties

b these base prices were adjusted to reflect applicable transportation and quality differentials on a well by well basis to arrive at realized sales prices used to estimate our reserves at these dates 
the reserve estimates reflected above were prepared by cawley  gillespie associates  inc  our independent petroleum consultants  and are part of reports on our oil and natural gas properties prepared by them 
in accordance with applicable requirements of the securities and exchange commission sec  estimates of our net proved reserves and future net revenues are made using sales prices estimated to be in effect as of the date of such reserve estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties except to the extent a contract specifically provides for escalation 
estimated quantities of net proved reserves and future net revenues there from are affected by oil and natural gas prices  which have fluctuated widely in recent years 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated values  including many factors beyond our control 
the reserve data set forth in the cawley  gillespie associates  inc report represents only estimates 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground 
table of contents accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geologic interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers  including those used by us  may vary 
in addition  estimates of reserves are subject to revision based upon actual production  results of future development and exploration activities  prevailing oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and other factors 
the revisions may be material 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered and are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based 
our estimated net proved reserves  included in our sec filings  have not been filed with or included in reports to any other federal agency 
see item a 
risk factors although our oil and gas reserve data is independently estimated  these estimates may still prove to be inaccurate 
estimates with respect to net proved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves rather than actual production history 
estimates based on these methods are generally less reliable than those based on actual production history 
subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in variations in the estimated reserves that may be substantial 
reconciliation of standardized measure to pre tax pv pre tax pv is the estimated present value of the future net revenues from our proved oil and natural gas reserves before income taxes discounted using a discount rate 
pre tax pv is considered a non gaap financial measure under sec regulations because it does not include the effects of future income taxes  as is required in computing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
we believe that pre tax pv is an important measure that can be used to evaluate the relative significance of our oil and natural gas properties and that pre tax pv is widely used by securities analysts and investors when evaluating oil and natural gas companies 
because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid  the use of a pre tax measure provides greater comparability of assets when evaluating companies 
we believe that most other companies in the oil and natural gas industry calculate pre tax pv on the same basis 
pre tax pv is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows but without deducting income taxes 
the table below provides a reconciliation of our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to our pre tax pv value 
at december  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows add present value of future income tax discounted at fas assumption differences pre tax pv
