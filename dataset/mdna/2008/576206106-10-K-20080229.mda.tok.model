item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  under the headings critical accounting estimates and assumptions  certain trends and uncertainties and elsewhere in md a 
we are impacted by the competitiveness of the markets in which we compete and market demand for coal 
we compete with coal producers in various regions of the united states and overseas for domestic and international sales 
continued domestic demand for our coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain primarily will depend upon coal consumption patterns of the domestic electric utility industry and the domestic steel industry 
consumption by the domestic utility industry is affected by the demand for electricity  environmental and other governmental regulations  technological developments and the price of competing coal and alternative fuel supplies including nuclear  natural gas  oil and renewable energy sources  including hydroelectric power 
consumption by the domestic steel industry is primarily affected by economic growth and the demand for steel used in construction as well as appliances and automobiles 
in recent years  the competitive environment for coal has been impacted by sustained growth in a number of the largest markets in the world  including the united states  china  japan and india  where demand for both electricity and steel have supported pricing for steam and metallurgical coal 
the cost of ocean transportation and the valuation of the united states dollar in relation to foreign currencies significantly impact the relative attractiveness of our coal as we compete on price with other foreign coal producing sources 
see item business  under the heading competition  for further discussion 
portions of our coal reserves possess quality characteristics that enable us to mine  process and market them as either metallurgical coal or high quality steam coal  depending on the prevailing conditions in the metallurgical and steam coal industries 
a decline in the metallurgical market relative to the steam market could cause us to shift coal from the metallurgical market to the steam market 
if demand for metallurgical coal declined to the point where we could earn a more attractive return marketing the coal as steam coal  there could be a material impact on cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
demand for our coal depends on its price and quality and the cost of transporting it to customers 
coal prices are influenced by a number of factors and may vary dramatically by region 
the two principal components of the price of coal are the price of coal at the mine  which is influenced by mine operating costs and coal quality  and the cost of transporting coal from the mine to the point of use 
the cost of mining the coal is influenced by geologic characteristics such as seam thickness  overburden ratios and depth of underground reserves 
underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of higher costs for labor including reserves for future costs associated with labor benefits and health care and capital costs including costs for mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems 
as of january   we operated active underground mines  including two longwall mines  and active surface mines  with highwall miners 
see item business  under the headings mining methods  mining operations and competition for further discussion 
transportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and  as a result  the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customer s purchasing decision 
increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy 
such increases could have a material impact on our ability to compete with other energy sources and on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
conversely  significant decreases in transportation costs could result in increased competition from coal producers in other parts of the country or the world  including coal imported into the united states several united states ports have announced plans to increase their capacity to import coal 
for instance  coal mines in the western united states could become an increasingly attractive source of coal to consumers in the eastern part of the country if the costs of transporting coal from the west were significantly reduced and rail capacity was increased 
see item business  under the heading competition  for further discussion 
a significant decline in coal prices in general could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
our results are highly dependent upon the prices we receive for our coal 
decreased demand for coal  both domestically and internationally  could cause spot prices and the prices we are able to negotiate on long term contracts to decline 
the lower prices could negatively affect our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition  if we are unable to increase productivity and or decrease costs in order to maintain our margins 
we depend on continued demand from our customers 
reduced demand from or the loss of our largest customers could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve projected revenue 
decreases in demand may result from  among other things  a reduction in consumption by the electric generation industry and or the steel industry  the availability of other sources of fuel at cheaper costs and a general slow down in the economy 
when our contracts with customers reach expiration  there can be no assurance that the customers either will extend or enter into new long term contracts or  in the absence of long term contracts  that they will continue to purchase the same amount of coal as they have in the past or on terms  including pricing terms  as favorable as under existing arrangements 
in the event that a large customer account is lost or a long term contract is not renewed  profits could suffer if alternative buyers are not willing to purchase our coal on comparable terms 
there may be adverse changes in price  volume or terms of our existing coal supply agreements 
many of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that permit the parties to adjust the contract price upward or downward at specified times 
these contracts may be adjusted based on inflation or deflation and or changes in the factors affecting the cost of producing coal  such as taxes  fees  royalties and changes in the laws regulating the mining  production  sale or use of coal 
in a limited number of contracts  failure of the parties to agree on a price under those provisions may allow either party to terminate the contract 
coal supply agreements also typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or the customer during the duration of specified events beyond the control of the affected party 
most coal supply agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal meeting quality thresholds for certain characteristics such as btu  sulfur content  ash content  grindability and ash fusion temperature 
failure to meet these specifications could result in economic penalties  including price adjustments  the rejection of deliveries or termination of the contracts 
see item business  under the heading customers and coal contracts for further discussion 
our financial condition may be adversely affected if we are required by some of our customers to provide performance assurances for certain below market sales contracts 
contracts covering a significant portion of our contracted sales tons contain provisions that could require us to provide performance assurances if we experience a material adverse change or  under certain other contracts  if the customer believes our creditworthiness has become unsatisfactory 
generally  under such contracts  performance assurances are only required if the contract price per ton of coal is below the current market price of the coal 
certain of the contracts limit the amount of performance assurance to a per ton amount in excess of the contract price  while others have no limit 
the performance assurances are generally provided by the posting of a letter of credit  cash collateral  other security  or a guaranty from a creditworthy guarantor 
as of february   we have not received any requests from any of our customers to provide performance assurances 
if we are required to post performance assurances on some or all of our contracts with performance assurances provisions  there could be a material impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to grow and compete and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our contracts and agreements 
at december   we had  million of total indebtedness outstanding  which represented of our total book capitalization 
we have significant debt  lease and royalty obligations 
our ability to satisfy debt service  lease and royalty obligations and to effect any refinancing of indebtedness will depend upon future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the markets that we serve as well as financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings  or other financings may be unavailable in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our debt service  lease and royalty payment obligations or our other liquidity needs 
our relative amount of debt could have material consequences to our business  including  but not limited to i making it more difficult to satisfy debt covenants and debt service  lease payments and other obligations  ii making it more difficult to pay quarterly dividends as we have in the past  iii increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  iv limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements  v reducing the availability of cash flows from operations to fund acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes  vi limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the business and the industry in which we compete  or vii placing us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors with relatively lower amounts of debt 
the covenants in our credit facility and the indentures governing debt instruments impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 
our asset based loan credit facility and the indentures governing our notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things i incur liens and debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person  ii increase common stock dividends above specified levels  iii make loans and investments  iv prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  v engage in mergers  consolidations and asset dispositions  vi engage in affiliate transactions  vii create lien or security interests in any real property or equipment  viii engage in sale and leaseback transactions  and ix restrict distributions from subsidiaries 
operating results below current levels or other adverse factors  including a significant increase in interest rates  could result in us being unable to comply with certain debt covenants 
if we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers from our lenders  our debt under these agreements would be in default and could be accelerated by the lenders 
if the indebtedness is accelerated  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if we are able to obtain new financing  it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us 
if our debt is in default for any reason  our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 
we depend on our ability to continue acquiring and developing economically recoverable coal reserves 
a key component of our future success is our ability to continue acquiring coal reserves for development that have the geological characteristics that allow them to be economically mined 
replacement reserves may not be available or  if available  may not be capable of being mined at costs comparable to those characteristics of the depleting mines 
an inability to continue acquiring economically recoverable coal reserves could have a material impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
we face numerous uncertainties in estimating economically recoverable coal reserves  and inaccuracies in estimates could result in lower than expected revenues  higher than expected costs and decreased profitability 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by us 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include i geological conditions  ii historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  iii the effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  iv future prices  and v future operating costs 
each of these factors may vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties may vary substantially 
as a result  our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual reserves 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
defects in title or loss of any leasehold interests in our properties could limit our ability to mine these properties or result in significant unanticipated costs 
a significant portion of our mining operations occurs on properties that we lease 
title defects or the loss of leases could adversely affect our ability to mine the reserves covered by those leases 
our current practice is to obtain a title review from a licensed attorney prior to leasing property 
we generally have not obtained title insurance in connection with acquisitions of coal reserves 
in some cases  the seller or lessor warrants property title 
separate title confirmation sometimes is not required when leasing reserves where mining has occurred previously 
our right to mine some of our reserves may be adversely affected if defects in title or boundaries exist 
in order to obtain leases to conduct our mining operations on property where these defects exist  we may have to incur unanticipated costs 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully negotiate new leases for properties containing additional reserves  or maintain our leasehold interests in properties where we have not commenced mining operations during the term of the lease 
if the coal industry experiences overcapacity in the future  our profitability could be impaired 
an increase in the demand for coal could attract new investors to the coal industry  which could spur the development of new mines  and result in added production capacity throughout the industry 
we have announced plans to increase our coal production by approximately over the next three years 
several of our competitors have also announced plans for increases in production capacity over the next several years 
higher price levels of coal could further encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers 
any resulting increases in capacity could further reduce coal prices and reduce our margins 
see item business  under the heading competition  for further discussion 
an inability of brokerage sources or contract miners to fulfill the delivery terms of their contracts with us could reduce our profitability 
we sometimes obtain coal from brokerage sources and contract miners to fulfill deliveries under our coal supply agreements 
some of our brokerage sources may experience adverse geologic mining  escalated operating costs and or financial difficulties that make their delivery of coal to us at the contracted price difficult or uncertain 
our profitability or exposure to loss on transactions or relationships such as these is dependent upon the reliability of the supply  the ability to substitute  when economical  third party coal sources with internal production or coal purchased in the market and other factors 
decreased availability or increased costs of key equipment  supplies or commodities such as diesel fuel  steel  explosives and tires could decrease our profitability 
our operations are dependant on reliable supplies of mining equipment  replacement parts  explosives  diesel fuel  tires  and steel related products including roof bolts 
if the cost of any mining equipment or key supplies increases significantly  or if they should become unavailable due to higher industry wide demand or less production by suppliers  there could be an adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
in recent years  mining industry demand growth has exceeded supply growth for certain surface and underground mining equipment and heavy equipment tires 
transportation disruptions could impair our ability to sell coal 
we are dependent on our transportation providers to provide access to markets 
disruption of transportation services because of weather related problems  strikes  lockouts or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to customers 
our ability to ship coal could be negatively impacted by a reduction in available and timely rail service 
lack of sufficient resources to meet a rapid increase in demand  a greater demand for transportation to export terminals and rail line congestion all could contribute to a disruption and slowdown in rail service 
severe weather may affect our ability to mine and deliver coal 
severe weather  including flooding and excessive ice or snowfall  when it occurs  can adversely affect our ability to produce  load and transport coal  which may negatively impact our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
federal and state government regulations applicable to operations increase costs and may make our coal less competitive than other coal producers 
we incur substantial costs and liabilities under increasingly strict federal  state and local environmental  health and safety and endangered species laws  regulations and enforcement policies 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens  the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations  the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations 
we may also incur costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from our operations 
see item business  under the heading environmental  safety and health laws and regulations for further discussion of this risk 
new legislation and new regulations may be adopted which could materially adversely affect our mining operations  cost structure or our customers ability to use coal 
new legislation and new regulations may also require us  as well as our customers  to change operations significantly or incur increased costs 
the epa has undertaken broad initiatives aimed at increasing compliance with emissions standards and to provide incentives to our customers for decreasing emissions  often by switching to an alternative fuel source or by installing scrubbers at their coal fired plants 
concerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion  including perceived impacts on global climate change  are resulting in increased regulation of coal combustion in many jurisdictions  and interest in further regulation  which could significantly affect demand for our products 
the clean air act and similar state and local laws extensively regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide  particulate matter  nitrogen oxides and other compounds emitted into the air from electric power plants  which are the largest end users of our coal 
such regulations may require significant emissions control expenditures for many coal fired power plants to comply with applicable ambient air quality standards 
as a result  the generators may switch to other fuels that generate less of these emissions or install more effective pollution control equipment  possibly reducing future demand for coal and the construction of coal fired power plants 
the majority of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that allow a purchaser to terminate its contract if legislation is passed that either restricts the use or type of coal permissible at the purchaser s plant or results in specified increases in the cost of coal or its use 
global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention 
widely publicized scientific reports in  such as the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change  have also engendered widespread concern about the impacts of human activity  especially fossil fuel combustion  on global climate change 
a considerable amount of legislative attention in the united states is being paid to global climate change and to reducing greenhouse gas emissions  particularly from coal combustion by power plants 
according to eia  emissions of greenhouse gases in the united states  coal accounts for of greenhouse gas emissions in the united states 
legislation was introduced in congress in and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the united states and additional legislation has been proposed and is likely to be introduced in the future 
in addition  a growing number of states in the united states are taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal fired power plants 
the united states supreme court s recent decision in massachusetts v 
environmental protection agency ruled that the epa improperly declined to address carbon dioxide impacts on climate change in a recent rulemaking 
although the specific rulemaking related to new motor vehicles  the reasoning of the decision could affect other federal regulatory programs  including those that directly relate to coal use 
enactment of laws and passage of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the united states or some of its states  or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions  could result in electric generators switching from coal to other fuel sources 
further developments in connection with legislation  regulations or other limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts from coal combustion  both in the united states and in other countries where we sell coal  could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
see item business  under the heading environmental  safety and health laws and regulations for further discussion of this risk 
msha or other federal or state regulatory agencies may order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed  which could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers demands 
msha or other federal or state regulatory agencies may order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed 
our customers may challenge our issuance of force majeure notices in connection with such closures 
if these challenges are successful  we may have to purchase coal from third party sources to satisfy those challenges  negotiate settlements with customers  which may include price reductions  the reduction of commitments or the extension of the time for delivery  terminate customers contracts or face claims initiated by our customers against us 
the resolution of these challenges could have an adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
we must obtain governmental permits and approvals for mining operations  which can be a costly and time consuming process and can result in restrictions on our operations 
our operations are principally regulated under surface mining permits issued pursuant to the smcra and state counterpart laws 
such permits are issued for terms of five years with the right of successive renewal 
additionally  the clean water act requires permits for operations that fill waters of the united states 
valley fills and refuse impoundments are typically authorized under nationwide permits that are revised and renewed periodically by the united states army corps of engineers 
additionally  certain surface mines and preparation plants have permits issued pursuant to the clean air act and state counterpart clean air laws allowing and controlling the discharge of air pollutants 
regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing of permit issuance 
requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of development or production operations 
see item business  under the heading environmental  safety and health laws and regulations for further discussion 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to attract qualified personnel could affect our ability to operate our company effectively 
the successful management of our business is dependent on a number of key personnel 
our future success will be affected by our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
there are no assurances that key personnel will continue to be employed by us or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future 
failure to retain or attract key personnel could have an adverse affect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
union represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs 
at december   of our total workforce was represented by the umwa 
during  six of our coal preparation plants and one smaller surface mine had a workforce represented by the umwa 
in  these preparation plants handled approximately of our coal production 
there may be an increased risk of strikes and other related work actions  in addition to higher labor costs  associated with these operations 
if some or all of our current open shop operations were to become union represented  we could be subject to additional risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs  which could adversely affect the stability of production and reduce net income 
we are subject to being adversely affected by a decline in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our customers 
in an effort to mitigate credit related risks in all customer classifications  we maintain a credit policy  which requires scheduled reviews of customer creditworthiness and continuous monitoring of customer news events that might have an impact on their financial condition 
negative credit performance or events may trigger the application of tighter terms of sale  requirements for collateral or  ultimately  a suspension of credit privileges 
the creditworthiness of customers can limit who we can do business with and at what price 
for the year ended december   approximately of coal sales volume was pursuant to long term contracts 
we anticipate that in  the percentage of our sales pursuant to long term contracts will be comparable with the percentage of our sales for and almost of our projected sales is contracted to be sold to our largest customers 
if one or more of our largest customers experiences financial difficulties and fails to make payment for our sales to them  there could be an adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
we have contracts to supply coal to energy trading and brokering companies who resell the coal to the ultimate users 
we are subject to being adversely affected by any decline in the financial condition and creditworthiness of these energy trading and brokering companies 
in addition  as the largest supplier of metallurgical coal to the american steel industry  we are subject to being adversely affected by any decline in the financial condition or production volume of american steel producers 
see item business  under the heading customers and coal contracts for further discussion 
we are subject to various legal proceedings  which may have a material effect on our business 
we are parties to a number of legal proceedings incident to normal business activities 
some of the allegations brought against us are with merit  while others are not 
there is always the potential that an individual matter or the aggregation of many matters could have an adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial position 
see item legal proceedings and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have significant reclamation and mine closure obligations 
if the assumptions underlying our accruals are materially inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
the smcra establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and our engineering expertise related to these requirements 
the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed periodically by management and engineers 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
see item business  under the heading environmental  safety and health laws and regulations for further discussion 
our future expenditures for postretirement benefit and pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions are incorrect 
we are subject to long term liabilities under a variety of benefit plans and other arrangements with current and former employees 
these obligations have been estimated based on actuarial assumptions  including actuarial estimates  assumed discount rates  estimates of life expectancy  expected returns on pension plan assets and changes in healthcare costs 
if our assumptions relating to these benefits change in the future or are incorrect  we may be required to record additional expenses  which would reduce our profitability 
in addition  future regulatory and accounting changes relating to these benefits could result in increased obligations or additional costs  which could also have a material impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
for a further discussion  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading critical accounting estimates and assumptions and notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions we undertake  as acquisitions entail a number of inherent risks 
from time to time we expand our business and reserve position through acquisitions of businesses and assets  mergers  joint ventures or other transactions 
such transactions involve various inherent risks  such as uncertainties in assessing the value  strengths and potential profitability of  and identifying the extent of all weaknesses  risks  contingent and other liabilities including environmental liabilities of  acquisition or other transaction candidates  the potential loss of key customers  management and employees of an acquired business  the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition or other transaction  problems that could arise from the integration of the acquired business  and unanticipated changes in business  industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition or other transaction rationale 
any one or more of these and other factors could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition of businesses or assets or could result in unexpected liabilities associated with these acquisitions 
foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal abroad 
we rely on customers in other countries for a portion of our sales  with shipments to countries in north america  south america  europe  asia and africa 
we compete in these international markets against coal produced in other countries 
coal is sold internationally in united states dollars 
as a result  mining costs in competing producing countries may be reduced in united states dollar terms based on currency exchange rates  providing an advantage to foreign coal producers 
currency fluctuations among countries purchasing and selling coal could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets 
terrorist attacks and threats  escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
our business is affected by general economic conditions  fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending  and market liquidity  which can decline as a result of numerous factors outside of our control  such as terrorist attacks and acts of war 
future terrorist attacks against united states targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the united states or its allies  or military or trade disruptions affecting customers may materially adversely affect operations 
as a result  there could be delays or losses in transportation and deliveries of coal to customers  decreased sales of coal and extension of time for payment of accounts receivable from customers 
strategic targets such as energy related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the united states 
in addition  such disruption may lead to significant increases in energy prices that could result in government imposed price controls 
it is possible that any  or a combination  of these occurrences could have a material impact on cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
coal mining is subject to inherent risks  some of which we insure against and some of which we self insure 
our operations are subject to certain events and conditions that could disrupt operations  including fires and explosions  accidental minewater discharges  natural disasters  equipment failures  maintenance problems and flooding 
we maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some  but not all  of these risks 
even where insurance coverage applies  there can be no assurance that these risks would be fully covered by insurance policies 
we self insure our highwall miners and underground equipment  including our longwalls 
we do not currently carry business interruption insurance 
diversity in interpretation and application of accounting literature in the mining industry may impact our reported financial results 
the mining industry has limited industry specific accounting literature and  as a result  we understand diversity in practice exists in the interpretation and application of accounting literature to mining specific issues 
as diversity in mining industry accounting is addressed  we may need to restate our reported results if the resulting interpretations differ from our current accounting practices for additional information regarding our accounting policies  please see results of operations critical accounting estimates and assumptions and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements

fisk factors and are incorporated herein 
executive overview we operate coal mines and processing facilities in central appalachia  which generate revenues and cash flow through the mining  processing and selling of steam and metallurgical grade coal  primarily of low sulfur content 
we also generate income and cash flow through other coal related businesses 
other revenue is obtained from royalties  rentals  gas well revenues  gains on the sale of non strategic assets and miscellaneous income 
we reported net income for the year ended december  of million  or per basic share  compared to net income for of million  or per basic share 
net income in included pre tax gains totaling approximately million related to a reserve exchange with a third party  million related to a favorable decision on our appeal of the previous jury decision in the harman lawsuit and million on the sale of a mineral rights override  offset by a million non tax deductible penalty related to a settlement with the epa 
net income in included pre tax gains totaling approximately million related to the sale of our falcon reserves 
produced tons sold were million in  compared to million in shipments of metallurgical and industrial coal improved significantly in over as productivity improved at underground room and pillar mines because of lower turnover and a more stable workforce  and as performance improved from the railroads shipping this coal 
shipments in were negatively affected by productivity issues at underground mines  including the loss of six months of production from our logan county resource group s aracoma longwall mine due to a fire in january and geological difficulties at several underground mines  especially at the longwall mines located at our independence and sidney resource groups 
in  we also experienced railroad congestion due to heightened coal demand and a lack of rail cars as well as a tight labor market that lead to high turnover and inexperienced workers 
we produced million tons during  compared to million tons produced in during  produced coal revenue increased by over the prior year as we benefited from higher utility coal sales prices secured in new coal sales agreements as lower priced contracts expired and we shipped a larger percentage of higher priced metallurgical tons in our average produced coal revenue per ton sold in increased by to compared to in and by over a five year period compared to in our average produced coal revenue per ton in for metallurgical tons sold increased by to from in we experienced a significant increase in costs during the past year period  with average cash cost per ton sold increasing from in fiscal to in fiscal a reconciliation of these non gaap figures is presented in footnote of item selected financial data 
the increased cost level is primarily due to indirect costs associated with compliance with new safety regulations  increased sales related costs from the growth in average per ton realization  higher labor costs  mining supplies costs and litigation settlements 
in june  the miner act was enacted into law  which  among other things  requires mine specific emergency response plans  enhanced communication systems  and more available mine rescue teams and provides for larger penalties by msha for noncompliance by mine operators 
in december  msha passed its final rule on emergency mine evacuation  which includes requirements for increased availability and storage of scsrs  improved emergency evacuation drills and scsr training and the installation and maintenance of lifelines in underground coal mines 
coal producing states  including west virginia and kentucky  passed similar legislation in while the full cost of compliance remains unknown  we expect to spend a total of million to million from to to fully comply with these laws 
the growth in cost estimate is a result of further development of regulations plus our proposed expansion  described below 
costs for safety equipment are capitalized in net property  plant and equipment 
additional substantive legislation is also possible in with the passage by the united states house of representatives in january of the s miner act 
the house legislation augments portions of the miner act and proposes changes to retreat mining practices  study of substance abuse issues and the use of coal dust monitors to reduce miner respirable dust exposure 
on may   the united states  on behalf of the administrator of the epa  filed suit against us and twenty seven of our subsidiaries in the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia district court 
the suit alleged that a number of our subsidiaries violated the federal clean water act on thousands of occasions by discharging pollutants in excess of monthly and daily permit limits from to on january   a proposed settlement reached with the epa was filed with the district court 
the settlement  which requires district court approval  requires us to pay million in penalties and make improvements in our environmental processes 
we expect the settlement to be approved by the district court in the first or second quarter of we recorded the million in cost of produced coal revenue in on july   a jury awarded damages in favor of wheeling pittsburgh steel corporation and mountain state carbon  llc in the amount of million  comprised of million compensatory and million punitive damages 
on july   the court awarded an additional million of pre judgment interest 
we have appealed this decision to the west virginia supreme court of appeals 
we believe that we have raised strong legal arguments in our appeal to the west virginia supreme court of appeals that create significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter 
ultimately  we believe it is unlikely any punitive damages will be assessed in this matter 
we further believe there is a strong possibility that the west virginia supreme court of appeals will remand the compensatory damages claim for retrial or significantly reduce the amount of the compensatory damages awarded by the jury 
we believe the range of possible loss in this matter is from million to million  prior to post judgment interest or other costs 
the minimum loss we expect to incur upon final settlement or adjudication is the amount of excess costs incurred by wps to acquire coal required but not delivered under the contract plus pre judgment interest adjusted for performance excused by events of force majeure 
amounts in excess of this amount may ultimately be awarded if the west virginia supreme court of appeals upholds the circuit court s decisions  in whole or in part  or if the west virginia supreme court of appeals remands the case for retrial and a jury awards the plaintiffs an amount in excess of what we have accrued 
we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter and believe there is no amount in the range that is a better estimate than any other amount given the various possible outcomes on appeal and  therefore  the minimum amount in the range has been accrued included in other current liabilities 
it is reasonably possible that our judgments regarding these matters could change in the near term  resulting in the recording of additional material losses that would affect our operating results and financial position 
we posted a million appeal bond with the court on october   which stays this matter pending disposition of our appeal 
refer to note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
in november  the west virginia supreme court reversed a jury decision in the harman lawsuit  finding in favor of us and reversing the jury award 
subsequently  on january   the court approved a motion to rehear the harman case 
we remain confident  however  that the court will ultimately uphold the november decision as we believe nothing has changed the facts or the law that the court will consider in reaching its final decision 
reflected in our fourth quarter results are a positive million pre tax impact recorded in cost of produced coal revenue and a positive pre tax impact of million recorded in interest expense stemming from the reversal of accruals that had been previously established in conjunction with the harman case 
in october  we announced plans to expand production at our central appalachian coal mining operations during the next two years 
our two year internal expansion and cost reduction plan  which began in the fourth quarter of  anticipates developing net additional annual production of million tons in versus  with the ramp up expected to occur during and additionally  these new tons will be weighted towards metallurgical coal production  which we believe will be cost advantaged versus existing comparable quality competitor production 
we expect to fund all of our expansion projects out of existing liquidity and operating cash flow generated in and  although some equipment may be acquired under operating or capital leases 
results of operations compared with revenues year ended december  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease revenues produced coal revenue freight and handling revenue purchased coal revenue other revenue total revenues the following is a breakdown  by market served  of the changes in produced tons sold and average produced coal revenue per ton sold for compared to year ended december  in millions  except per ton amounts increase decrease increase decrease produced tons sold utility metallurgical industrial total produced coal revenue per ton sold utility metallurgical industrial weighted average shipments of metallurgical and industrial coal increased in compared to  mainly due to improved productivity at underground room and pillar mines resulting from lower turnover and a more stable workforce  and improved performance from the railroads shipping this coal 
the average per ton sales price for utility coal continued to improve in  attributable to prices contracted during a period of increased demand for utility coal in the united states 
the higher demand resulted in shortages of certain quality utility coal  increasing the market prices of this coal  and allowed us to negotiate agreements containing higher price terms as lower priced contracts expired 
the decrease in average per ton sales price for the industrial market is mainly attributable to lower pricing on sales contracted for shipments 
purchased coal revenue increased mainly due to an increase in purchased tons sold from million in to million in  offset by a decrease in revenue per ton 
we purchase varying amounts of coal to supplement produced coal sales 
other revenue includes refunds on railroad agreements  royalties related to coal lease agreements  gas well revenue  gains on the sale of non strategic assets and reserve exchanges  earnings from the sale and operation of a synfuel plant  joint venture revenue and other miscellaneous revenue 
other revenue for includes a pre tax gain of million on an exchange of coal reserves and million on the sale of a mineral rights override 
in addition  railroad refunds and royalty income were higher in than in  offset by lower synfuel earnings in compared to other revenue for includes a pre tax gain of million on the sale of our falcon reserves see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
costs year ended december  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease costs and expenses cost of produced coal revenue freight and handling costs cost of purchased coal revenue depreciation  depletion and amortization  applicable to cost of produced coal revenue selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative other expense total costs and expenses cost of produced coal revenue increased due to increased sales related costs on higher produced coal revenues including production royalties and severance taxes  increased supplies costs including diesel fuel and explosives  and higher indirect costs associated with compliance with new safety regulations 
supplies costs increased both due to a commodity driven inflationary increase and overall usage as the volume of produced tons sold increased from million tons in to million tons in cost of purchased coal revenue increased due to an increase in purchased tons sold from million in to million in  offset by a decrease in average cost of purchased coal per ton 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to higher stock based and performance based compensation expenses due to increased stock price value in and attainment of more performance based compensation targets versus interest interest income increased due to higher cash and interest bearing deposit balances during as compared to income taxes income tax expense was million for compared with a tax expense of million for the income tax rates for and were favorably impacted by percentage depletion allowances and the usage of net operating loss carryforwards 
the income tax rate for was negatively impacted by a nondeductible epa settlement and an increase in deferred tax asset valuation allowances related principally to federal net operating losses

in  we also experienced railroad congestion due to heightened coal demand and a lack of rail cars and a tight labor market that lead to high turnover and inexperienced workers 
the improvement in our average per ton sales price was attributable to prices contracted during a period of increased demand for all grades of coal in the united states and for metallurgical coal worldwide 
the higher demand resulted in shortages of certain coals  increasing the market prices of these coals  and allowed us to negotiate agreements containing higher price terms as our lower priced sales contracts expired 
increased prices for alternative fuel sources such as oil and natural gas also resulted in higher demand for certain coals 
exports of metallurgical coal decreased by million tons  or  to million tons for as compared to due to lower production 
purchased coal revenue decreased mainly due to a decrease in purchased tons sold from million in to million in  offset by a increase in revenue per ton

also negatively impacting cost of produced coal revenue were higher sales related costs for production royalties and taxes  and severance and black lung excise taxes associated with the increase in average realized prices 
tons produced during were million compared to million during cost of purchased coal revenue decreased mainly due to a decrease in purchased tons sold from million in to million in  offset by a increase in average cost of purchased coal per ton 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower stock based compensation accruals due to changes in the price of the company s stock and lower performance linked executive compensation accruals in other expense  which consists of costs associated with the generation of other revenue  such as costs to operate the coal handling facilities  gas wells  and other miscellaneous expenses  decreased due to decreases in operating costs of the gas wells and synfuel facility  while senior note repurchase losses were recognized in interest interest income increased due to higher levels of cash reserves during and higher interest rates received on investments during interest expense increased primarily a result of a debt restructuring that occurred in december  which increased debt levels in compared to  and resulted in a higher effective interest rate 
interest expense in included a million write off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs related to our debt restructuring 
income taxes the income tax rate for was favorably impacted by percentage depletion allowances  the usage of a net operating loss carryforward and the adjustment of reserves in connection with the closing of a prior period audit by the irs 
the income tax rate for was negatively impacted by the non deductibility on the early payout of deferred compensation million tax effect and the non deductibility on our debt repurchases and exchange offers during the fourth quarter

nevertheless  our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations  repurchase shares  pay dividends  pay settlements and final awards of outstanding litigation  or fund planned capital expenditures including planned expansions  will substantially depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal industry  debt covenants  and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we frequently evaluate potential acquisitions 
in the past  we have funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations  but we may consider a variety of other sources  depending on the size of any transaction  including debt or equity financing 
additional capital resources may not be available to us on terms that we find acceptable  or at all 
share repurchases the board of directors has authorized a total of million excluding commissions to repurchase our common stock under our share repurchase program

other obligations  such as certain purchase commitments  operating lease agreements  and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities within the consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
the following table is a summary of our significant obligations as of december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
the table does not include current liabilities accrued within the consolidated financial statements  such as accounts payable and payroll and employee benefits 
payments due by period in thousands total within year years years beyond years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations coal lease obligations purchased coal obligations other purchase obligations total obligations long term debt obligations reflect the future interest and principal payments of our fixed rate senior unsecured notes outstanding as of december  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
capital lease obligations include the amount of imputed interest over the terms of the leases 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
coal lease obligations include minimum royalties paid on leased coal rights 
certain coal leases do not have set expiration dates but extend until completion of mining of all merchantable and mineable coal reserves 
for purposes of this table  we have generally assumed that minimum royalties on such leases will be paid for a period of years 
purchased coal obligations represent commitments to purchase coal from external production sources under firm contracts as of december  other purchase obligations primarily include capital expenditure commitments for surface mining and other equipment as well as purchases of materials and supplies 
we have purchase agreements with vendors for most types of operating expenses 
however  our open purchase orders which are not recognized as a liability until the purchased items are received under these purchase agreements  combined with any other open purchase orders  are not material and are excluded from this table 
other purchase obligations also include contractual commitments under transportation contracts 
since the actual tons to be shipped under these contracts are not set and will vary  the amount included in the table reflects the minimum payment obligations required by the contracts 
additionally  we have liabilities relating to pension and other postretirement benefits  work related injuries and illnesses  and mine reclamation and closure 
as of december   payments related to these items are estimated to be payments due by years in thousands within year years years our determination of these noncurrent liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from year to year 
in any year  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
moreover  in particular for periods after  the estimates may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 
these assumptions are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in critical accounting estimates and assumptions of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees  operating leases  indemnifications  and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets  and  except for the operating leases  which are discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  we do not expect any material impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
from time to time we use bank letters of credit to secure our obligations for workers compensation programs  various insurance contracts and other obligations 
at december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding of which million was collateralized by million of cash deposited in restricted  interest bearing accounts pledged to issuing banks and million was issued under our asset based lending arrangement 
no claims were outstanding against those letters of credit as of december  on january   a settlement was reached regarding our previously reported disagreement and protest of a new actuarial methodology being applied by the office of workers claims owc for the commonwealth of kentucky in determining levels of surety against potential future claims 
the settlement resulted in the dismissal of our cases pending in the franklin county circuit court of kentucky and required us to post additional surety of million for the and assessments against potential claims 
that additional surety requirement was satisfied with the posting of a letter of credit issued under our asset based lending arrangement 
we use surety bonds to secure reclamation  workers compensation  wage payments  and other miscellaneous obligations 
as of december   we had million of outstanding surety bonds 
these bonds were in place to secure obligations as follows post mining reclamation bonds of million  an appeal bond of million  and other miscellaneous obligation bonds of million 
outstanding surety bonds of million are secured with letters of credit 
in addition  in october  we deposited million into an interest bearing account which is pledged to an insurance company that issued the million appeal bond in the wheeling pitt legal matter see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
the million is reported in deposits within other current assets 
generally  the availability and market terms of surety bonds continue to be challenging 
if we are unable to meet certain financial tests applicable to some of our surety bonds  or to the extent that surety bonds otherwise become unavailable  we would need to replace the surety bonds or seek to secure them with letters of credit  cash deposits  or other suitable forms of collateral 
certain trends and uncertainties our inability to satisfy contractual obligations may adversely affect profitability 
from time to time  we have disputes with customers over the provisions of sales agreements relating to  among other things  coal pricing  quality  quantity  delays and force majeure declarations 
our inability to satisfy contractual obligations could result in the purchase of coal from third party sources to satisfy those obligations  the negotiation of settlements with customers  which may include price reductions  the reduction of commitments or the extension of the time for delivery  and customers terminating contracts  declining to do future business with us  or initiating claims against us 
we may not be able to resolve all of these disputes in a satisfactory manner  which could result in the payment of substantial damages or otherwise harm our relationships with our customers 
the planned expansion of our coal production involves a number of risks  any of which could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits 
in october  we announced plans to expand production at our central appalachian coal mining operations during the next two years 
our two year internal expansion and cost reduction plan anticipates developing net additional annual production of million tons in versus  with the ramp up occurring during and additionally  these new tons will be weighted towards metallurgical coal production  which we believe will be cost advantaged versus existing comparable quality competitor production 
we expect to fund all of our expansion projects out of existing liquidity and operating cash flow generated in and if we are unable to successfully expand our coal production  our profitability may decline and we could experience a material adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
these expansion plans involve certain risks  including the accuracy of our assumptions of the recoverability of the coal reserves to be mined  assumptions about the availability of skilled labor to staff the new and expanded mines  assumptions about the availability and cost of the capital equipment required for each of the new and expanded mines  and unanticipated changes in business  industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying our rationale for expanding our production 
any one or more of these factors could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from our expansion plans 
our expansion plans could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness  seek equity  capital or both 
we are subject to being adversely affected by the potential inability to renew or obtain surety bonds 
federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining  to pay federal and state workers compensation  and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations 
these bonds are typically renewable annually 
surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals 
we are also subject to increases in the amount of surety bonds required by federal and state laws as these laws change or the interpretation of these laws changes 
our failure to maintain  or inability to acquire  surety bonds that are required by state and federal law would have a material impact on us 
that failure could result from a variety of factors including the following i lack of availability  higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new bonds  ii restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of our senior notes or revolving credit facilities  iii our inability to meet certain financial tests with respect to a portion of the post mining reclamation bonds  and iv the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew or issue new bonds 
shortages of skilled labor in the central appalachian coal industry may pose a risk in achieving high levels of productivity at competitive costs 
coal mining continues to be a labor intensive industry 
in recent years  we have encountered a shortage of experienced mine workers when the demand and prices for all specifications of coal we mine increased appreciably 
the hiring of these less experienced workers has negatively impacted our productivity and cash costs 
a continued lack of skilled miners could continue to have an adverse impact on our labor productivity and cost and our ability to meet current production requirements to fulfill existing sales commitments or to expand production to meet the increased demand for coal 
inflationary pressures on supplies and labor may adversely affect our profit margins 
generally  inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years 
however  over the course of the last two years  we have been significantly impacted by price inflation in many of the components of our cost of produced coal revenue  such as fuel  steel  copper and labor 
for instance  the prices of diesel fuel and copper each increased approximately over the two year period ending december  if the prices for which we sell our coal do not increase in step with rising costs  our profit margins will be reduced 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
significant changes to the estimates and assumptions used in determining certain liabilities described below could introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions were used in the preparation of the financial statements defined benefit pension plans the estimated cost and benefits of non contributory defined benefit pension plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  with management s review and approval  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  future rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the applicable liabilities could be effectively settled as of the measurement date 
in estimating the discount rate  forecasted cash flows were discounted using each year s associated spot interest rate on high quality fixed income investments 
at december  and  the discount rate used to determine defined benefit pension liability was and  respectively 
the impact of lowering the discount rate for would have increased the net periodic pension expense by approximately million 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is determined based upon our long term plans for such increases 
the rate of increase in compensation levels used was for the years ended december  and the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on long term historical return information and future estimates of long term investment returns for the target asset allocation of investments that comprise plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to determine expense in each period was for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return assumption would have increased the net periodic pension expense by approximately million 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our pension plans 
coal workers pneumoconiosis we are responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  and various states statutes  for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
an annual evaluation is prepared by independent actuaries  who  after review and approval by management  use various assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs trend  cost of living trend  mortality  death benefits  dependents and interest rates 
we record expense related to this obligation using the service cost method 
at december  and december   the discount rate used to determine the black lung liability was and  respectively 
included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements is a medical cost trend and cost of living trend sensitivity analysis 
workers compensation our operations have workers compensation coverage through a combination of either self insurance  participation in a state run program  or commercial insurance 
we accrue for the self insured liability by recognizing cost when it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
to assist in the determination of this estimated liability we utilize the services of third party administrators who derive claim reserves from historical experience 
these third parties provide information to independent actuaries  who after review and consultation with management with regards to actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  prepare an evaluation of the self insured liabilities 
at december  and december   the discount rate used to determine the self insured workers compensation liability obligation was 
a decrease in the assumed discount rate increases the workers compensation self insured liability and related expense 
actual experience in settling these liabilities could differ from these estimates  which could increase our costs 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on workers compensation 
other postretirement benefits our sponsored health care plans provide retiree health benefits to eligible union and non union retirees who have met certain age and service requirements 
depending on year of retirement  benefits may be subject to annual deductibles  coinsurance requirements  lifetime limits  and retiree contributions 
these plans are not funded 
we pay costs as incurred by participants 
the estimated cost and benefits of the retiree health care plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  after review and approval by management  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs and per capita claims costs 
at december  and december   the discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit liability was and  respectively 
the impact of lowering the discount rate for would have increased the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by approximately million 
at december   our assumptions of the company health care plans cost trend were projected at an annual rate of ranging down to by ranging down to by at december   and remaining level thereafter 
the impact of increasing the health care cost trend rate by would have increased the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by approximately million 
included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements is a sensitivity analysis on the health care trend rate assumption 
reclamation and mine closure obligations the smcra establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and engineering estimates related to these requirements 
we account for our reclamation liabilities under sfas sfas requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value  which is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
management and engineers periodically review the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability and the expected period in which reclamation work will be performed 
in estimating future cash flows  we considered the estimated current cost of reclamation and applied inflation rates and a third party profit  as necessary 
the third party profit is an estimate of the approximate markup that would be charged by contractors for work performed on our behalf 
the discount rate applied is based on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flow  adjusted for our credit standing 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
contingencies we are parties to a number of legal proceedings  incident to our normal business activities 
these matters include contract disputes  personal injury  property damage and employment matters 
while we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings  based on our current estimates  we do not believe that any liability arising from these matters individually or in the aggregate should have a material impact upon our consolidated cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
however  it is reasonably possible that the ultimate liabilities in the future with respect to these lawsuits and claims may be material to our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
see item legal proceedings and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our contingencies 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  as interpreted by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including tax attribute carrybacks  the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of our valuation allowance  we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
under fin  we establish reserves based upon management s assessment of exposure associated with tax positions taken relative to temporary and permanent tax differences and tax credits  plus penalties and interest on the accrued uncertain tax positions 
the tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserves 
we are currently under audit from the irs for the calendar years ended december  and management believes that we have adequately provided for any income taxes and penalties and interest that may ultimately be paid with respect to all open tax years 
coal reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves 
many of these uncertainties are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our internal engineers  geologists and financial associates 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include i geological conditions  ii historical production from similar areas with similar conditions  iii the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  iv assumptions governing future prices  and v future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
variances would effect both the consolidated statements of income  in the form of revenue and expenditures  as well as the consolidated balance sheets  in the form of valuation of coal reserves  depletion rates and potential impairment 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information concerning the effect of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk our net interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of short term interest rates 
at december   the outstanding  million of our debt was under fixed rate instruments 
upon the termination of our million interest rate swap agreement in december  our interest expense is no longer sensitive to changes in the general level of short term interest rates 
however  if it should become necessary to borrow under our asset based revolving credit facility  those borrowings would be made at a variable rate 
interest income is sensitive to changes in short term interest rates 
assuming that cash and cash equivalents was fixed at the december  level of million  a hypothetical basis point decrease in money market interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million in interest income 
we manage market price risk for coal through the use of long term coal supply agreements  which are contracts with a term of one year or more in duration  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
we estimate that the percentage of sales pursuant to these long term contracts was for our fiscal year ended december  we anticipate that in  the percentage of our sales pursuant to long term contracts will be comparable with the percentage of our sales for the prices for coal shipped under long term contracts may be below the current market price for similar types of coal at any given time 
as a consequence of the substantial volume of our sales that are subject to these long term agreements  we have less coal available with which to capitalize on stronger coal prices if and when they arise 
in addition  because long term contracts typically allow the customer to elect volume flexibility  our ability to realize the higher prices that may be available in the spot market may be restricted when customers elect to purchase higher volumes under such contracts  or our exposure to market based pricing may be increased should customers elect to purchase fewer tons
