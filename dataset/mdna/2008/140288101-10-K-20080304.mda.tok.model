item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements  included elsewhere in this filing 
name change on july   capital lease funding  inc changed its name to caplease  inc and elected to retain its nyse stock ticker as lse 
overview we are a diversified reit that invests primarily in single tenant commercial real estate assets subject to long term leases to high credit quality tenants 
we focus on properties that are subject to a net lease 
see business overview for what constitutes a net lease 
we also continue to be opportunistic and have made and expect to continue to make investments in single tenant properties where the owner has exposure to property expenses when we determine we can sufficiently underwrite that exposure and isolate a predictable cash flow 
our primary business objective is to generate stable  long term and attractive returns based on the spread between the yields generated by our assets and the cost of financing our portfolio 
we invest at all levels of the capital structure of net lease and other single tenant properties  including equity investments in real estate owned real properties  debt investments mortgage loans and net lease mortgage backed securities and mezzanine investments secured by net leased or other single tenant real estate collateral 
for properties that we own  in addition to high quality tenant credit  we also seek to invest in strong real estate locations that will appreciate over time 
the principal sources of our revenues are rental income on our owned real properties and interest income from our debt investments loans and securities 
the principal sources of our expenses are interest expense on our assets financed  depreciation expense on our real properties  general and administrative expenses and property expenses net of expense recoveries 
we rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns 
we expect our leverage to average to of our assets in portfolio 
our overall portfolio leverage as of december  was approximately 
our portfolio financing strategy is to finance our assets with long term fixed rate debt as soon as practicable after we invest  generally on a secured  non recourse basis 
we seek to match fund our assets  or obtain long term debt whose maturity matches the maturity of the asset financed 
through december   our long term financings have been in the form of traditional third party mortgage financings on most of our owned real properties and two term financings  including a secured term loan completed in december and one cdo completed in march 
for assets not yet financed with long term fixed rate debt  we employ a hedging strategy to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates prior to the time we obtain long term fixed rate financing 
we rely primarily on equity and debt capital to fund our portfolio growth 
through december   our primary capital issuances have been our initial public offering of common stock in march net proceeds of million  a series a preferred stock issuance in october net proceeds of million  trust preferred debt issued in december net proceeds of million  a follow on common stock offering in each of may and may june net proceeds of million and million  respectively  and a million convertible senior note offering in october net proceeds of million 
summary of investment and financing activity in the following summarizes certain aspects of our portfolio investment and financing activity during the year ended december  we added new investments of approximately million  including the acquisition of real properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
most of our new investment activity took place in the first half of  when market conditions were competitive  but reasonably stable 
in april  we acquired a portfolio real estate assets net leased to five different tenants for a purchase price of million the entrecap portfolio 
the entrecap portfolio included assets leased to or leases guaranteed by nestle holdings  inc  the kroger co  factory mutual insurance company  qwest corporation  and the travelers corporation 
we financed our real property acquisitions with million of fixed rate mortgage debt including million of debt assumed at its fair market value on the travelers corporation property in the entrecap portfolio 
we also obtained million of year term financing secured by approximately million principal amount of collateral at a fixed interest coupon of annually and an effective financing rate of annually 
in connection with our acquisition of the entrecap portfolio  we borrowed million under a bridge borrowing facility and assumed million outstanding principal amount of mortgage debt  all of which was repaid in full during business environment during the second half of  the commercial real estate finance and overall credit markets entered a period of significant instability 
this instability has continued and intensified into early and has impacted our company in a variety of ways  including by making it difficult for us to price and finance new investment opportunities on attractive terms 
as a result of market conditions  we have not been adding new asset investments to our investment portfolio 
causing a delay in the long term financing of the mortgage assets financed under our repurchase agreement  which were scheduled to be financed through a cdo 
we successfully financed a portion of this collateral in a year term financing transaction in december  and are continuing to discuss with several financial institutions a number of alternatives for refinancing the remainder of this collateral 
during parts of the third quarter of  we also experienced increases in our short term borrowing costs as a result of increases in the london interbank offered rate  or libor  which is the borrowing base under our repurchase agreement 
widening credit spreads and reduced market trading activity for real estate securities have also resulted in lower valuations on our real estate securities 
to date  consistent with prevailing accounting guidance  these lower valuations have impacted us primarily through reductions in stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet  rather than through impairment charges directly to our consolidated statement of operations 
we do not know when market conditions will stabilize  if adverse conditions will intensify or the full extent to which the disruptions will affect us 
if market instability persists or intensifies  the trends discussed above may continue and we may be impacted in a variety of additional ways 
for example  we may experience challenges in raising additional capital  margin calls on our repurchase agreement and impairment charges on our assets  particularly on our loan and securities investments 
we may also seek to preserve liquidity until credit markets normalize 
application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of judgments  estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of our accounting policies that are most affected by judgments  estimates and assumptions 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
loan investments 
since our initial public offering  our loan investments have been  and we expect in the future they will continue to be  accounted for as long term investments  as our strategy contemplates that we hold the loans for the foreseeable future or until maturity 
we are required to periodically evaluate each of these loans for possible impairment 
impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the asset 
upon determination of impairment  we must establish a specific valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to earnings 
significant judgment is required both in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting loss allowance 
in determining impairment and any loan loss allowance  we evaluate factors such as the status of the loans ie  current or expected payment or other defaults  the credit quality of the underlying tenants  the present value of expected future cash flows on the loans  the fair market value of our collateral  and the amount and status of any senior debt 
as of december   we had no loss allowances on any of the loans in our portfolio 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate 
we allocate the purchase price of rental real estate acquired to the following based on fair values acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of above market and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships 
in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired  we consider information obtained about each property as a result of our due diligence activities and other market data  and utilize various valuation methods  such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates  estimates of replacement costs  and available market information 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant the dark value 
above market and below market lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the differences between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease 
fair market lease rates are measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market rate renewal options for below market leases 
in computing present value  we consider the costs which would need to be invested to achieve the fair market lease rates 
we use a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases  and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below market renewal options of the respective leases 
other intangible assets acquired include in place leases and tenant relationships which are valued based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
factors considered by management in its analysis of in place lease values include an estimate of the dark value of the property  carrying costs during the hypothetical expected time it would take management to find a tenant to lease the space for the existing lease term a lease up period considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
management estimates carrying costs  including such factors as real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses during the expected lease up period  considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  management considers leasing commissions and other related expenses 
characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of in place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases 
the value of tenant relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships 
through december   we have assigned no value to tenant relationships on any of our acquisitions 
securities available for sale 
we treat our investments in securities as available for sale and account for them in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
as such  they are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported on our balance sheet as a component of other comprehensive income or loss 
fair value is based primarily upon our estimates of value  based upon broker quotations where available  yields on assets of similar credit quality and duration  or good faith estimates of those yields 
the indicated quotations may be subject to significant variability based on market conditions  including interest rates and spreads 
while a liquid market for these securities typically exists  the securities may not be frequently traded and  therefore  we may not be able to sell them at our estimates of value 
changes in market conditions  as well as changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value  could result in a significant increase or decrease in the equity on our balance sheet 
we must also assess whether any unrealized losses on securities reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary 
if so  we must write the impaired security down to its fair value through a charge to our statement of operations 
significant judgment is required in this analysis 
in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider whether the decline is due to factors such as changes in interest rates or credit spreads typically temporary or credit rating downgrades on the securities or credit defaults on the underlying collateral assets typically other than temporary 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the underlying credit and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the underlying credit for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value 
we recorded other than temporary declines in the fair value of our cmbs securities of million for  million for and million for impairment on owned real properties 
we own real properties for investment 
we review these properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
upon determination of impairment  we would record a write down of the asset  which would be charged to earnings 
significant judgment is required both in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting write down 
through december   we have determined that no write downs have been necessary on any of our owned real properties 
derivative instruments and other risk management transactions 
our derivative instruments and other risk management transactions  which we hold for hedging or other risk management purposes  are carried at fair value pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
fair value is based on market quotations 
fair values on such derivatives are subject to significant variability based on many of the same factors as our securities available for sale discussed above 
further  to the extent the derivatives qualify as hedges under sfas no 
 net unrealized gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity on our balance sheet  otherwise  they are reported as a component of current income or loss on our statement of operations 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas  our derivatives must meet various technical requirements under sfas  including satisfying hedge effectiveness testing at each reporting date 
failure to meet these requirements would result in the change in value of the derivative instrument being charged directly to our statement of operations without any offset from the change in fair value of the related hedged transaction 
stock based compensation 
pursuant to our stock incentive plan  we have made and expect to continue to make awards of common stock to our employees with vesting subject to attainment of performance criteria 
under sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  we are required to estimate the probability of vesting of these shares quarterly and recognize expense generally equal to the fair market value of the shares awarded on the grant date for any shares deemed probable to vest over the period the employee is required to perform services to receive the shares 
we base our estimates of probability on an assessment of our actual results against the relevant performance criteria 
these estimates may change over time as our actual results against the criteria are re assessed 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on the expense we recognize 
property acquisitions during the quarter ended december   we did not complete any new real property acquisitions 
business segments we conduct our business through two operating segments operating real estate including our investments in owned real properties  and lending investments including our loan investments as well as our investments in securities 
segment data for the year ended december  are as follows amounts in thousands corporate operating lending unallocated real estate investments total total revenues total expenses and minority interest gain on extinguishment of debt income loss from continuing operations total assets segment data for the year ended december  are as follows amounts in thousands corporate operating lending unallocated real estate investments total total revenues total expenses and minority interest income loss from continuing operations total assets segment data for the year ended december  are as follows amounts in thousands corporate operating lending unallocated real estate investments total total revenues total expenses and minority interest income loss from continuing operations total assets results of operations during the year ended december   we continued to execute on our business plan as a long term holder of equity  debt and mezzanine investments in net lease and other single tenant assets 
comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december the following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended december  to the comparable period in revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily attributable to increases in rental income and property expense recoveries and an increase in interest income  offset in part by decreases in gain on sale of loans and securities and other revenue 
rental income and property expense recoveries  in the aggregate  increased million  or  to million 
we continued to make significant investments in owned properties during  and the significant increase in revenues associated with these investments is a result of the large growth in this portion of our overall investment portfolio during and interest income increased million  or  to million 
the increase was due to modestly larger overall aggregate loan and security investments 
we had no gains on sale of mortgage loans and securities in  compared to gains of million during the activity reflected gains on the sale of securities in the fourth quarter of million and a gain we earned on the origination and sale of a mortgage loan in the first quarter of million 
other revenue decreased million  or  from million to million  primarily reflecting income we received on loans that were paid off in expenses 
total expenses increased million  or  to million 
the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to higher levels of interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense on real property  property expenses and general and administrative expenses  and losses on two cmbs investments  offset in part by a reduction in stock based compensation expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million  from million 
the increase was primarily the result of million of increased interest expense on our property mortgages originated or assumed in and  million of additional interest expense under our repurchase agreement primarily resulting from higher borrowings and interest rates in  million of fees paid under the bridge facility we entered into in connection with the acquisition of the entrecap portfolio  million of interest expense under the bridge facility  million of interest expense on the convertible senior notes we issued in october  and million of interest expense on the secured term loan we issued in december our average balance outstanding under the repurchase agreement was approximately million during  compared with approximately million during depreciation and amortization expense on real property increased million  or to million  as a result of the significant increase in real estate investments made during and property expense increased million  or  to million 
the net amount of property expenses we incurred in net of expense recoveries was million 
the growth in property expenses reflects the growth of our portfolio as well as our purchase of properties with greater overall exposure to property expenses under the lease provisions  primarily with respect to leases with the united states government 
while our investment focus continues to be on net leased properties  we expect to continue to pursue properties where we have exposure to property expenses when we determine we can sufficiently underwrite that exposure and isolate a predictable cash flow 
loss on securities decreased million  to million in  from million in losses in reflect impairment losses on two cmbs securities during the second quarter of management determined that other than temporary declines in the fair value below cost basis had occurred on these two investments 
losses in relate to write downs we took on our securities as a result of exposure to the winn dixie bankruptcy 
the losses in both periods are discussed at note of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  from million to million  primarily reflecting higher employee compensation due to increased headcount and higher legal expenses primarily associated with the retirement of debt we assumed upon acquisition of the entrecap portfolio 
general and administrative expense stock based compensation decreased million  as our transition to a five year vesting period and a lower vesting percentage for performance based awards in offset an additional year of stock awards amortizing to expense 
as of december   million of unvested shares fair value at the grant dates is expected to be charged to our consolidated statement of operations ratably over the remaining vesting period through march 
as of december   the grant date fair value for awards of  shares made in   shares made in  and  shares made in had not yet been determined because the grant date as defined under relevant accounting guidance had not yet occurred 
gain on extinguishment of debt 
we had million of non cash gains on extinguishment of debt in the period  relating to our retirement of debt we assumed when we purchased the entrecap portfolio 
these gains resulted from interest rate changes between the date we assumed the debt and the date it was repaid 
net income loss 
net income loss decreased from million to million  primarily as a result of increases in interest expense  depreciation expense and property expenses  offset in part by an increase in rental revenues and property expense recoveries 
net loss allocable to common stockholders was million in  reflecting dividends to preferred stockholders of million 
comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december the following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended december  to the comparable period in revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily attributable to increases in rental income and property expense recoveries and increases in interest income  gain on sale of loans and securities and other revenue 
rental income and property expense recoveries  in the aggregate  increased million  or  to million 
we continued to make significant investments in owned properties during  and the significant increase in revenues associated with these investments is a result of the large growth in this portion of our overall investment portfolio during and rental income for the period includes million from assets consolidated under fin as described in note in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  we were required under fin to recognize revenue and expense on one of our real property purchases prior to our acquisition date because a deposit we made on our purchase price had become non refundable 
interest income increased million  or  to million 
the increase was due to larger overall aggregate loan and security investments 
gain on sale of loans and securities increased to million  from million  primarily reflecting gains on the sale of securities in the fourth quarter of million and a gain we earned on the origination and sale of a mortgage loan in the first quarter of million 
other revenue increased million  or  to million  from million  primarily reflecting income we received on loans that were paid off in expenses 
total expenses increased million  or  to million 
the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to increases in interest expense  depreciation expense and property related expenses  offset in part by lower loss on securities 
interest expense increased million  or  to million  from million 
the increase was primarily the result of million of increased interest expense on our property mortgages  million of increased interest expense on our march cdo borrowings and million of additional interest expense on the trust preferred debt we issued in december in addition  interest expense on our borrowings under our repurchase agreement increased million  or  from million to million 
this was the result of higher average borrowing levels and higher rates of interest on our repurchase agreement borrowings in the results included interest expense of million from assets consolidated under fin depreciation and amortization expense on real property increased million  or to million  as a result of the significant increase in real estate investments made during and depreciation and amortization expense for the period includes million of expense from assets consolidated under fin property expense increased million  or  to million 
the net amount of property expenses we incurred in net of expense recoveries was million 
the growth in property expenses reflects the growth of our portfolio as well as our purchase of properties with greater overall exposure to property expenses under the lease provisions  primarily with respect to leases with the united states government 
while our investment focus continues to be on net leased properties  we expect to continue to pursue properties where we have exposure to property expenses when we determine we can sufficiently underwrite that exposure and isolate a predictable cash flow 
property expenses for the period include million of expense from assets consolidated under fin loss on securities decreased million  to million in  from million in all losses related to write downs we took on our real estate securities as a result of exposure to the winn dixie bankruptcy 
general and administrative expense was relatively unchanged  as it decreased million  or  to million  from million 
general and administrative expense stock based compensation increased million  reflecting an additional year of stock awards under our stock plan amortizing to expense 
during  we recognized to expense a portion of the stock awards made to our directors  officers and other employees during march  march and march  because we have historically used a three year vesting schedule for our stock awards 
during january  we began using a five year vesting schedule for stock awards 
as of december   million of unvested shares fair value at the grant dates is expected to be charged to our statement of operations ratably over the remaining vesting period through march 
net income 
net income increased from million to million  primarily as a result of lower loss on securities and increased income from discontinued operations million in total from allstate pittsburgh and cott properties 
increases in rental income  property expense recoveries  interest income  gain on sale of loans and securities and other revenue were basically offset by increases in interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense and property expenses 
net income allocable to common stockholders was million in  reflecting dividends to preferred stockholders of million 
funds from operations funds from operations  or ffo  is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe ffo is a useful additional measure of our performance because it facilitates an understanding of our operating performance after adjustment for real estate depreciation  a non cash expense which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
in addition  we believe that ffo provides useful information to the investment community about our financial performance as compared to other reits  since ffo is generally recognized as an industry standard for measuring the operating performance of an equity reit 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
since all companies and analysts do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  our calculation of ffo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we calculate ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit which defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the following table reconciles our net income loss allocable to common stockholders to ffo for the years ended december   december  and december  year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net income loss allocable to common stockholders adjustments add minority interest op units add depreciation and amortization expense on real property add depreciation and amortization expense on discontinued operations funds from operations weighted average number of common shares outstanding  diluted weighted average number of op units outstanding weighted average number of common shares and op units outstanding  diluted net income loss per common share  basic and diluted funds from operations per share gain on sale of mortgage loans and securities depreciation on real estate investments consolidated under fin liquidity and capital resources we rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns 
leverage also exposes us to a variety of risks which are discussed in more detail in elsewhere in this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
we expect our leverage to average to of our assets in portfolio 
our overall portfolio leverage as of december  was approximately 
our portfolio financing strategy is to finance our assets with long term fixed rate debt as soon as practicable after we invest  generally on a secured  non recourse basis 
we seek to match fund our assets  or obtain long term debt whose maturity matches the maturity of the asset financed 
through december   our long term asset financings have been in the form of traditional third party mortgage financings on most of our owned real properties and two term financings  including a secured term loan completed in december and one cdo completed in march 
as of december   we have financed on a long term basis an aggregate of approximately billion of portfolio assets with third party mortgage debt of million and term financings of million 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis  and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income in order to comply with the distribution requirements of the code and to avoid federal income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
we declared total dividends of per share of common stock during the year ended december   including per share in each of the first  second  third and fourth quarters 
we also declared a dividend of per share of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock in each of the first  second  third and fourth quarters of short term liquidity and financing 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through our available cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operations  and through our repurchase agreement and million revolving loan agreement the revolver  in each case with wachovia bank 
we also expect that a portion of the proceeds from our issuances of debt and or equity capital will be used for short term liquidity 
as of december   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
our repurchase agreement  which is day facility and was renewed in august  provides us with core borrowing capacity of million  and borrowing capacity of up to million until we complete our next collateralized debt obligation 
borrowings under our repurchase agreement are secured by the assets financed and our obligations are fully recourse to our other assets 
our repurchase agreement allows us to finance our assets on a short term basis while we arrange long term financing 
we pay interest at prevailing short term interest rates day libor plus a spread determined based upon the class and credit rating of the asset financed 
the repurchase agreement is uncommitted  meaning wachovia bank may decline to advance on any asset we seek to finance 
as a result  we cannot make any assurance that our borrowing capacity on the repurchase agreement will continue to be available to us 
wachovia bank also has the right to initiate a margin call if our assets financed decline in value including as a result of a tenant downgrade 
we had million outstanding as of december  under our repurchase agreement  which borrowings were secured by loan investments with an aggregate carry value of million  intercompany mortgage loans on caplease owned properties with an aggregate carry value of million and securities with a carry value of million 
the revolver is a three year facility which we initially entered into in july the revolver provides that we may borrow up to million from time to time over the three year term  and our borrowings will bear interest at prevailing short term interest rates day libor plus basis points 
our borrowings under the revolver are secured by a first mortgage on the factory mutual property included in the entrecap portfolio and an assignment of our interest in the lease and rents on the property 
the revolver is a fully recourse lending arrangement 
we are permitted to use proceeds from borrowings under the revolver for any corporate purpose  including to fund investments or repay other indebtedness 
as of december   the company had not yet borrowed any amount under the revolver 
we entered into a temporary million short term credit agreement with wachovia bank  na in april in connection with the acquisition of the entrecap portfolio the bridge facility 
the bridge facility matured and was repaid in full and terminated on july our million real property acquisition facility with wachovia bank and one of its affiliates expired by its terms on august  long term liquidity and financing 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements generally through cash provided by operations  long term fixed rate financings on our asset investments and issuances of debt and equity capital 
through december   our primary capital issuances have been our initial public offering of common stock in march net proceeds of million  a series a preferred stock issuance in october net proceeds of million  trust preferred debt issued in december net proceeds of million  a follow on common stock offering in each of may and may june net proceeds of million and million  respectively  and a million convertible senior note offering in october net proceeds of million 
our million convertible senior note offering was completed on october  a description of the terms of the notes is included at note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we have used million of the proceeds of this offering to purchase shares of our common stock at the closing of the offering and million to repay borrowings under our repurchase agreement 
we intend to use the remaining proceeds from the sale of the notes for general corporate purposes  which may include further debt repayment and funding of new investments 
in may and june  we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock in a public offering at a price to the public of per share  and raised net proceeds of approximately million  after the underwriting discount and offering expenses 
the shares were issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement 
we used the proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of our borrowings under the bridge facility 
in march  we implemented a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
the plan provides us with an additional source of equity capital 
the plan allows interested stockholders to reinvest all or a portion of their cash dividends in shares of our common stock and to make monthly purchases of our common stock generally up to a maximum of  unless a higher amount is approved by us in our sole discretion 
shares purchased through the plan may be either i newly issued by us or ii purchased by the plan administrator in the open market  at our discretion 
during the three months ended december   we issued no shares of common stock through the plan 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock through the plan at an average price of per share 
as of december   we have reserved an aggregate of  shares of common stock for future issuance pursuant to the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
we expect to continue to raise additional capital from time to time to enable us to continue to implement our growth strategy  although the precise timing of our next capital raise will be impacted by our pace of investment activity and market conditions 
our ability to raise capital is influenced by market conditions  and we cannot assure you that conditions for raising capital will be favorable for us at any time 
as of the date of filing of this form k  we have an effective shelf registration statement under which we can offer an aggregate of million of common stock  preferred stock and or senior or subordinated debt securities from time to time 
long term mortgage financings 
during the year ended december   we obtained million of long term third party mortgage financing on our real property acquisitions 
we also assumed debt of an aggregate of million fair market value of debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of the travelers corporation property in the entrecap portfolio  and assumed and then repaid million of mortgage debt on the other entrecap portfolio properties 
our mortgage financings are fixed rate financings 
the notes typically mature over a long term period of approximately ten years  and debt service is payable monthly 
the notes are generally non recourse to us but are secured by a mortgage on the property and an assignment of the underlying lease and rents on the property 
the notes include limited non recourse exceptions 
the notes are often interest only for all or a portion of the note term  and thus require a balloon payment at maturity 
we believe the value of the assets financed is  and will continue to be  sufficient to repay or refinance our debt at maturity 
term financings 
in december  we completed a million original principal balance secured term loan 
upon closing of the financing  we pledged approximately million principal amount of collateral to secure our obligations under the loan 
the interest coupon on the loan is fixed at annually until the loan matures in january our effective financing rate on the loan is annually inclusive of hedge and closing costs 
the loan is non recourse to us  subject to limited non recourse exceptions 
we also completed an entirely fixed rate cdo financing in march we aggregated approximately million of assets and then transferred these assets into a wholly owned securitization vehicle  and issued million face amount of multi class notes and million of preferred equity through the securitization vehicle 
the assets serve as collateral for the obligations under the notes 
the securitization vehicle is an spe  with its business limited to the issuance of the notes and the preferred equity  the acquisition of the collateral and certain other matters related thereto 
the net amount of the debt we issued was million  inclusive of a million discount to face  as we retained the three most junior note classes aggregating a face amount of million and the full million of preferred equity 
each of the five note classes of the cdo was rated investment grade 
during the first five years of the cdo term  we expect to reinvest principal repayments on the underlying assets into qualifying replacement collateral 
the cdo notes have a stated maturity in january  but are expected to mature in january when the notes become subject to an auction call procedure 
our weighted average effective financing rate inclusive of original issue discount and debt issuance and hedge costs on our cdo is approximately 
our cdo debt is non recourse to us but is secured by the collateral assets 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our repurchase agreement  which borrowings were secured by loan investments with an aggregate carry value of million  intercompany mortgage loans on caplease owned properties with an aggregate carry value of million and securities with a carry value of million 
our repurchase agreement matures in august we continue to discuss with several financial institutions a number of alternatives for refinancing these assets 
pursuant to the terms of the repurchase agreement  if the value of the assets securing our borrowings declines  we could be subject to lender margin calls 
no assurance can be made as to the timing and certainty of refinancing these assets and our business could be materially adversely affected if we experience a significant delay or are unable to do so 
in addition  if our actual cost to long term finance these assets exceeds our current projections  our future results of operations and cash flows could be harmed 
statement of cash flows operating activities provided million of cash during the year ended december   primarily driven by net income as adjusted by various non cash gains  income and charges of million and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  partially offset by increases in other assets of million 
operating activities provided million of cash during  primarily driven by net income as adjusted by various non cash gains and charges of million  increases in accounts payable of million and decreases in other assets of million  partially offset by decreases in deposits and escrows of million 
we used million of cash in operating activities in our net income as adjusted for straight lining of rents  various non cash gains and losses and depreciation and amortization charges was million  but was offset by increases in other assets of million net of million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  decreases in deposits and escrows of million and amounts due to servicers and dealers of million 
the increase in other assets in was driven by million of funds being held by our cdo trustee at year end pending distribution or reinvestment  million of cash being held in escrow by our mortgage lenders to fund various property related costs like tenant improvements  capital expenditures and property expenses  and million of rents receivable on several of our owned properties 
we recognize rental income on our owned properties on a straight line basis in accordance with sfas as of december   this has resulted in us accruing million of rental income in excess of actual rents due under the various leases 
during the year ended december   rents on a straight line basis exceeded actual rents due under the leases by million 
we expect the impact of straight lining of rents to fluctuate over time as contractual rents step up and actual rents due increase under the various leases and we purchase additional properties 
certain of our owned properties are also subject to rents which pay semi annually  rather than monthly  and this also impacts the quarter to quarter changes due to straight lining of rents

see our consolidated statements of cash flows in the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing for a reconciliation of our cash position for the periods described above 
risk management transactions since our initial public offering  we have employed a hedging strategy to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations prior to the time we obtain long term fixed rate financing for our assets 
our risk management activities during this period have consisted primarily of interest rate swaps  and we expect they will continue to consist primarily of interest rate swaps in the future 
in accordance with sfas  the interest rate swaps are treated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes to the extent that they have been designated and qualify as such 
the effective portion of our realized and unrealized gains and losses on such transactions are treated as a component of other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet and are not reported as a component of current income or loss on our consolidated statement of operations 
the effective portion of our realized gains and losses  which generally represent the net payments we make or receive on the interest rate swaps  are then reclassified and amortized as part of interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations beginning at issuance of the related debt and continuing over the expected term of such issuance 
to the extent the sfas no 
cash flow hedge criteria are not met or the hedge is deemed ineffective  some or all of the realized and unrealized gains and losses on such transactions are treated as a component of current income or loss on our statement of operations 
while we have historically had only modest amounts of gain or loss on risk management transactions reported as a component of current income or loss  no assurance can be made that we will continue to satisfy the cash flow hedge requirements of sfas no 
and as to the portion of our gains and losses that will be deemed effective under sfas no 
for example  if we experience a delay in our expected debt issuances  we may be required to include a greater portion of our gains and losses from the associated risk management transactions as current income or loss 
see note in our consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional discussion of our hedging and risk management transactions 
we settle our derivative and other risk management transactions in cash 
therefore  upon settlement  we will pay or receive cash for the net amount due 
these amounts could be material and could have a material impact positive or negative on our liquidity 
we seek to settle these transactions simultaneous with the closing of our financing transaction for the related hedged asset to mitigate the possible adverse impact on our liquidity 
contractual obligations the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than total year years years after years mortgages on real estate investments collateralized debt obligations secured term loan convertible senior notes other long term debt operating leases repurchase agreement obligations total negative amounts shown with respect to our collateralized debt obligations represent amortization of original issue discount 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had the following off balance sheet arrangements 
we are obligated under a letter of credit with respect to one of our prior securitization transactions bscms clf 
the maximum potential amount of future required payments under the letter of credit is million 
the letter of credit expires on february  the trustee of the securitization trust may draw the letter of credit if there are realized losses on the mortgage loans in the collateral pool that would create a shortfall in the interest or principal on any investment grade certificate 
the letter of credit may be withdrawn when the ratings of the investment grade certificates are no longer dependent upon the credit support provided by the letter of credit 
during february  one of the mortgage loans in the securitization on a property leased to winn dixie defaulted  in connection with the bankruptcy of winn dixie 
this loan was liquidated by the trust in the fourth quarter of we do not expect any draw on the letter of credit as a result of this mortgage default  or otherwise 
we entered into an office lease in april for our corporate offices at avenue of the americas  new york  new york 
the term of the lease is for seven years and five months with a base rent of approximately million per year for the first four years after a five month rent free period and approximately million per year for the remainder of the term 
during october  we acquired a real property in fresno  california leased to aetna life insurance company  and agreed to fund expected improvements to the real property of approximately million 
during november  we arranged long term financing on this property and we funded a reserve account with our lender for the full amount of this obligation 
we expect these funds will be disbursed in full as improvements are completed 
as of december   none of these funds have been disbursed 
we have agreed to contribute up to million of capital to a newly formed real estate investment and management company  subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions by the principals of the company 
as of december   we had deposited approximately million toward our aggregate million commitment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices  rate indices or other market factors 
we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates  credit spreads  tenant credit ratings and equity prices 
we attempt to mitigate certain of these risks by entering into hedge and other risk management transactions during the short term and fixed rate financings for the long term 
we seek to obtain long term fixed rate financing as soon as practicable after we make an asset investment 
there can be no assurance  however  that such mitigation strategies will be completely or even partially successful 
the level of our exposure to market risk is subject to factors beyond our control  including political risk including terrorism  monetary and tax policy  general economic conditions and a variety of other associated risks 
interest rate exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk in various aspects of our business 
the most significant ways we can be impacted by interest rates are as follows 
increases in the level of interest rates may impact our ability to add new assets  as spreads on assets we are targeting may compress unless there is a corresponding increase in asset returns and demand for our products may be adversely affected 
also  to the extent we finance assets in our portfolio on our short term borrowing facilities  our net income from these fixed rate assets will decrease as interest rates rise and our borrowing cost increases 
in addition  as interest rates rise  our anticipated cost to finance these assets on a long term basis may rise  causing our expected spread on these assets to be reduced 
we attempt to mitigate these risks by entering into risk management transactions that react in a manner that offsets our increased interest costs and by locking our long term financing cost as soon as practicable after we commit to an asset 
as noted above  there can be no assurance that our mitigation strategies will be successful 
furthermore  shifts in the us treasury yield curve  which represents the market s expectations of future interest rates  would also affect the yield required on our loans and real estate securities 
changes in the required yield would result in a higher or lower value for these assets 
if the required market yields increase as a result of these interest rate changes  the value of our loans and real estate securities would decline relative to us treasuries 
conversely  if the required market yields decrease as a result of interest rate changes  the value of our loans and real estate securities would increase relative to us treasuries 
these changes in the market value may affect the equity on our balance sheet or  if the value is less than our cost basis and we determine the losses to be other than temporary  our statement of operations through impairment losses on our loans or securities 
these value changes may also affect our ability to borrow and access capital  particularly with respect to our short term financing obligations where the lender has the right to initiate a margin call when the value of its collateral declines 
credit spread curve exposure we are subject to credit spread risk in various aspects of our business 
credit spreads represent the portion of the required yield on an income investment attributable to credit quality 
credit spreads fluctuate over time as investor appetite for credit risk changes 
changes in credit spreads can have many of the same impacts on us as a change in interest rates  or principally as credit spreads widen  our short term borrowing costs may rise  increases in credit spreads can result in spread compression on investments we target and  thus  a slowing of our new investment pace  increases in credit spreads can increase our anticipated cost to finance assets not yet long term financed  causing our expected spread on these assets to be reduced  and increases in credit spreads can lower the value of our loans and securities as required yields on these assets increase 
tenant credit rating exposure substantially all of our portfolio assets are subject to risks due to credit rating changes of the underlying tenant or tenants 
deterioration in the underlying tenant s credit rating can result in a lower value for the related asset  which could result in a reduction in the equity on our balance sheet or  if the value is less than our cost basis and we determine the loss to be other than temporary  an impairment loss on our statement of operations 
in addition  declines in the credit rating of a particular tenant prior to our obtaining long term financing could increase our short term financing costs and result in a margin call by our short term lender  and precipitous declines may significantly impede or eliminate our ability to finance the asset 
we manage these risks by maintaining diversity among our credits and assessing our aggregate exposure to ratings classes  in particular lower rated classes 
we also seek to lock or procure long term financing on our assets as promptly as practicable after we commit to invest 
equity price risk exposure we may seek to raise capital by sale of our common stock 
our ability to do so is dependent upon the market price of our common stock and general market conditions 
fair value for certain of our financial instruments  fair values are not readily available since there are no active trading markets as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties 
accordingly  we derive or estimate fair values using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated cash flows may be subjective and imprecise 
changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material affect on these estimated fair values 
the fair values indicated below are indicative of the interest rate and credit spread environment as of december   and may not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate or credit spread fluctuations  or changes in the ratings of the underlying tenants 
the following summarizes certain data regarding our interest rate sensitive instruments as of december  dollars in thousands weighted average effective interest financing maturity carrying amount notional amount rate date fair value assets loans held for investment various securities available for sale structuring fees receivable n a n a derivative assets n a n a liabilities repurchase agreement obligations short term mortgages on real estate investments collateralized debt obligations secured term loan convertible senior notes other long term debt derivative liabilities n a n a this portfolio of loans bears interest at fixed rates 
we have estimated the fair value of this portfolio of loans based on sales of loans with similar credit and structural characteristics where available  and management s estimate of fair values where comparable sales information is not available 
the maturity dates for the loans range from through securities available for sale represent subordinate interests in securitizations cmbs  as well as pass through certificates representing our pro rata investments in a pool of mortgage loans 
structuring fees receivable represent cash flows receivable by us from the sale of loans to third party purchasers 
the notional values for the cmbs are shown at their respective face amounts 
fair value for the cmbs is based on third party quotations  where obtainable  or our estimate of fair value  based on yields of comparably rated securities in the cmbs market 
fair value for the structuring fees receivable is shown at our amortized cost for these items 
for the securities available for sale  we expect to receive monthly interest coupon payments  and contractual principal payments as scheduled 
these instruments represent hedging and risk management transactions involving interest rate swaps 
they have been valued by reference to market quotations 
our repurchase agreement obligations bear interest at floating rates  and we believe that for similar financial instruments with comparable credit risks  the effective rates approximate market value 
accordingly  the carrying amounts outstanding are believed to approximate fair value 
we estimate the fair value of mortgage notes on real estate investments  collateralized debt obligations and the secured term loan using a discounted cash flow analysis  based on our estimates of market interest rates 
for mortgages where we have an early payment right  we also consider the prepayment amount to evaluate the fair value 
the maturity date of the collateralized debt obligations reflects our expected maturity date in january and is used to compute the related fair value and weighted average effective interest rate 
we estimate the fair value of our convertible senior notes using a discounted cash flow analysis  based upon management s estimates of market interest rates  and indications of market yields  where available 
the maturity date of our convertible senior notes reflects our expected maturity date in october when the note investors have the right to require us to repurchase their notes for cash and is used to compute the related fair value and weighted average effective interest rate 
we estimate the fair value of our other long term debt using a discounted cash flow analysis  based upon management s estimates of market interest rates 
the maturity date of our other long term debt reflects our expected maturity date in january and is used to compute the related fair value and weighted average effective interest rate
