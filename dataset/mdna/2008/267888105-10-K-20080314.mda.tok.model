item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes  as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
unless stated otherwise  all dollar figures in this discussion are presented in thousands s 
executive overview historically  our business has been organized into two segments explosive metalworking which we also refer to as dmc clad and amk welding 
on november   we acquired ownership of a german company  dynaenergetics 
dynaenergetics operates two distinct businesses which have historically been known as dynaplat and dynawell 
dynaplat is a manufacturer of explosion clad products similar to those manufactured by dmc clad and its operating results from the date of acquisition are included in our explosive metalworking segment 
dynawell manufactures a number of products for the perforation of oil and gas wells and also distributes a line of seismic products for oil and gas exploration activities 
dynawell s operating results from the date of acquisition are reported under a new segment that we have named oilfield products 
in  explosive metalworking accounted for more than of our net sales and of our income from operations of continuing operations before consideration of stock based compensation expense  which is not allocated to our business segments 
in and  explosive metalworking accounted for more than of our net sales and more than of income from operations of continuing operations 
our net sales  which include  of sales from the newly acquired dynaenergetics businesses for the period november through december   increased compared to  reflecting year to year net sales increases of and for our explosive metalworking and amk welding segments  respectively 
explosive metalworking s sales included a  contribution from dynaenergetics explosion clad business and our new oilfield products segment reported sales of  our income from operations of continuing operations increased  to  in from  in  reflecting a  improvement in explosive metalworking s operating income and a improvement in amk welding s operating income offset by a small operating loss of reported by oilfield products 
income from continuing operations increased  to  in from  in our net income increased to  in from  in our net income included  of income from discontinued operations  net of tax  relating to the sale of the spin forge real estate option in the first quarter and the sale of leased manufacturing equipment and tooling associated with the spin forge business in the fourth quarter 
see detailed discussion below under income from discontinued operations 
net sales explosive metalworking s net sales are generated principally from sales of clad metal plates and sales of transition joints  which are made from clad plates  to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various industries  including oil and gas  petrochemicals  alternative energy  hydrometallurgy  aluminum production  shipbuilding  power generation  industrial refrigeration and similar industries 
while demand for our clad metal products in the united states is largely driven by new plant construction and large plant expansion projects  maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing  petrochemical processing and oil refining facilities also account for a significant portion of total demand 
in contrast to the us market  demand for our clad products in europe and asia is more dependent on new construction projects  such as the building of new purified terephthalic acid pta plants in different parts of the world  including china  and on sales of electrical transition joints that are used in the aluminum production industry 
oilfield products net sales are generated principally from sales of shaped charges  detonators and detonating cord and bidirectional booster sand perforating guns to customers who perform the perforation of oil and gas wells and from sales of seismic products to customers involved in oil and gas exploration activities 
amk welding s net sales are generated from welding  heat treatment and inspection services that are provided with respect to customer supplied parts for customers primarily involved in the power generation industry and aircraft engine markets 
a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers  therefore  the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis  and to receive payment for such services in a timely manner  or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities 
we attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality  delivering product on time and competing favorably on the basis of price 
dmc clad s business is cyclical since it is linked to its customers end market activity 
for example  the construction cycle for new manufacturing capacity in the chemical industry has historically been one characterized by significant amplitude 
it is driven both by global economic demand growth and capacity utilization 
as capacity starts to become tight for various chemicals and prices begin to rise  new manufacturing capacity is added in relatively large incremental amounts 
gross profit and cost of products sold cost of products sold for explosive metalworking include the cost of metals and alloys used to manufacture clad metal plates  the cost of explosives  employee compensation and benefits  freight  outside processing costs  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
cost of products sold for oilfield products include the cost of metals  explosives and other raw materials used to manufacture shaped charges  detonating products and perforating guns as well as employee compensation and benefits  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
amk welding s cost of products sold consists principally of employee compensation and benefits  welding supplies wire and gas  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  outside services and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
discontinued operations in september  we completed the sale of our spin forge division and recorded a loss from discontinued operations of  net of taxes  including a net of tax operating loss of and a net of tax loss on the divesture transactions of on january   we sold our option rights to purchase the spin forge real estate to the property owner for  we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately  on this transaction  which was reported as discontinued operations  net of related taxes  in the first quarter of in december  we sold the spin forge equipment to the buyer of that division who had previously been leasing that equipment from us 
the sale of this equipment resulted in an additional pre tax gain on discontinued operations of we reported a net of tax income of  for the full year as a result of these two transactions 
income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to in from in income tax provisions on the earnings of nobelclad  nitro metall and dynaenergetics have been provided based upon the respective french  swedish and german statutory tax rates for the applicable years 
going forward  based upon existing tax regulations and current federal  state and foreign statutory tax rates  we expect our effective tax rate on our consolidated pre tax income to range between and 
backlog we use backlog as a primary means of measuring the immediate outlook for our business 
we define backlog at any given point in time to consist of all firm  unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time 
generally speaking  we expect to fill most backlog orders within the following months 
from experience  most firm purchase orders and commitments are realized 
however  since orders may be rescheduled or canceled  and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels 
moreover  we cannot be sure of when during the future month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be sure that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the month horizon 
our backlog with respect to the explosive metalworking segment increased to approximately  at december   including  of backlog for the recently acquired dynaenergetics clad business  from approximately  at december  and  at december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales change percentage change net sales    net sales for increased to  from  in explosive metalworking sales increased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
the year to year increase in worldwide explosive metalworking sales is principally attributable to the improved economic condition of the industries that this business segment serves and also reflects sales of  for the period november through december  from the acquisition of dynaenergetics 
oilfield products contributed  to sales of total sales for the november through december  time period 
amk welding contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
the increase in amk welding s sales relates principally to increased revenues from h system ground based gas turbine work

the increase in fixed manufacturing overhead expenses at amk welding is attributable to the recently completed facility expansion and staffing additions as amk readies itself for anticipated increases in production levels during oilfield products reported a gross margin of on its sales of  which is considered to be within the range of normal for this business 
the decreased year to date gross margin rate for explosive metalworking relates primarily to changes in product mix during as compared to that for during  the gross margins that we reported in our quarterly financial statements ranged from a low of in the fourth quarter to a high of in the second quarter 
gross margins for our european operations  including those of the dynaplat division of dynaenergetics  are generally lower than those reported by our us operation 
inclusion of dynaplat s sales and cost of products sold for the period from november through december  lowered explosive metalworking gross margins to a level that is likely more representative of gross margins levels that we expect to report during than those reported during prior quarters of during  the gross margins that we reported in our quarterly financial statements ranged from a low of in the third quarter to a high of in the fourth quarter 
the high fourth quarter gross margin reflects the impact of favorable margin levels on an  contract that shipped during the quarter  which involved complex materials engineering and a tight delivery schedule 
we expect to see continued fluctuations in our quarterly gross margin rates during that result from anticipated fluctuations in quarterly sales volume and changes in product mix

in december  the third party purchaser of the spin forge business purchased the majority of the leased equipment while the remainder of the leased assets was liquidated by the company 
these transactions resulted in a pre tax gain of  which was recorded in discontinued operations  net of related taxes 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations from a combination of internally generated cash flow  revolving credit borrowings  various long term debt arrangements and the issuance of common stock 
prior to the november  acquisition of dynaenergetics  we had no outstanding borrowings under our  revolving credit facility with a us bank and term debt outstanding of euros approximately under a term loan with a french bank 
in connection with the acquisition of dynaenergetics  we terminated our  revolving credit facility and entered into a five year syndicated credit agreement 
the credit agreement  which provides for term loans of  and  euros and revolving loans of  and  euros  is through a syndicate of seven banks 
the credit facility in the approximate amount of  expires on november  as of the acquisition closing date and as of december   term loans of  and  euros were outstanding under the new credit facility 
additionally  we have assumed outstanding debt obligations of dynaenergetics  including lines of credit loans and term loans in the amounts of  and  respectively  as of december  we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our current credit facilities and any future replacement thereof will be sufficient to fund the working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements of our current business operations for the foreseeable future 
nevertheless  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations will depend upon our success in executing our strategies 
if we are unable to i realize sales from our backlog  ii secure new customer orders at attractive prices  iii successfully integrate the recently acquired dynaenergetcis businesses  and iv continue to implement cost effective internal processes  our ability to meet cash requirements through operating activities could be impacted 
furthermore  any restriction on the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities could negatively affect our ability to meet future cash requirements 
debt and other contractual obligations and commitments our existing loan agreements include various covenants and restrictions  certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders  redemption of capital stock  incurrence of additional indebtedness  mortgaging  pledging or disposition of major assets and maintenance of specified financial ratios

critical accounting policies our historical consolidated financial statements and notes to our historical consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that our management make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity 
interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us 
in management s opinion  the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are revenue recognition  asset impairments  inventory valuation and impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  and actual results could differ from the estimates  as additional information becomes known 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition sales of clad metal products and welding services are generally based upon customer specifications set forth in customer purchase orders and require us to provide certifications relative to metals used  services performed and the results of any non destructive testing that the customer has requested be performed 
all issues of conformity of the product to specifications are resolved before the product is shipped and billed 
products related to the oilfield products segment  which include detonating cords  detonators  bi directional boosters and shaped charges  as well as  seismic related explosives and accessories  are standard in nature 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
for contracts that require multiple shipments  revenue is recorded only for the units included in each individual shipment 
if  as a contract proceeds toward completion  projected total cost on an individual contract indicates a potential loss  the company will account for such anticipated loss 
asset impairments we review our long lived assets and held and used by us for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in so doing  we estimate the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
long lived assets to be disposed of  if any  are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
business combinations we accounted for our business acquisition in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  using the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated the total cost of the acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
as part of this allocation process  we identified and attributed values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired 
these determinations involved significant estimates and assumptions regarding multiple  highly subjective variables  including those with respect to future cash flows  discount rates  asset lives  and the use of different valuation models and therefore require considerable judgment 
our estimates and assumptions were based  in part  on the availability of listed market prices or other transparent market data 
these determinations affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods 
we based our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain 
goodwill and other intangible assets we review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually to assess impairment because it is not amortized 
additionally  we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes in circumstances  many of which are subjective in nature  include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy  a significant decrease in the market value of the asset  and a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset 
we assess impairment by comparing the fair value of an identifiable intangible asset or goodwill with its carrying value 
the determination of fair value involves significant management judgment as described further below 
impairments are expensed when incurred 
specifically  we test for impairment as follows goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 we test goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level as defined by reference to sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information on at least an annual basis 
a reporting unit is a group of businesses i for which discrete financial information is available and ii that have similar economic characteristics 
we test goodwill for impairment using the following two step approach we first determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  this is an indicator that the goodwill assigned to that reporting unit might be impaired  which requires performance of the second step 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on projected future discounted cash flows  which  in turn  are based on our views of uncertain variables such as growth rates  anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values 
in the second step  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had just been acquired in a business combination and as if the purchase price was equivalent to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill 
we then compare that implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value we recognize an impairment loss for the excess 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our reporting units or using a methodology other than a discounted cash flow model could result in different values for reporting units and could result in an impairment charge 
intangible assets subject to amortization an intangible asset that is subject to amortization is reviewed when impairment indicators are present in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we compare the expected undiscounted future operating cash flows associated with finite lived assets to their respective carrying values to determine if the asset is fully recoverable 
if the expected future operating cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  we estimate the fair value of the asset 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and when the carrying value exceeds fair value 
the projected cash flows require several assumptions related to  among other things  relevant market factors  revenue growth  if any  and operating margins 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 
impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks the functional currency for our foreign operations is the applicable local currency for each affiliate company 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency are translated at exchange rates in effect at period end  and the statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates during the period 
exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars that result in unrealized gains or losses are referred to as translation adjustments 
cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in other cumulative comprehensive income loss 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise 
subsequent changes in exchange rates result in transaction gains and losses  which are reflected in income as unrealized based on period end translations or realized upon settlement of the transactions 
cash flows from our operations in foreign countries are translated at actual exchange rates when known  or at the average rate for the period 
as a result  amounts related to assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows will not agree to changes in the corresponding balances in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effects of exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign currencies are reported as a separate line item below cash flows from financing activities 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in our financial statements but not our tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine if they will more likely than not be recovered from future projected taxable income and  if not  we record an appropriate valuation allowance 
during  we completed an analysis of prior year tax credits and related items 
as a result of the analysis  we filed amended federal and state income tax returns 
the amended state returns reported additional net operating losses and credits above the amounts we had previously recorded in our books and records 
in assessing these additional losses and credits  we determined that the utilization of a portion of these did not meet the more likely than not criteria  due to potential changes in the states in which we have income tax nexus 
thus  we recorded a net valuation allowance of approximately against the deferred tax assets during as of december   the balance of this allowance is stock based compensation expense we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the fair value of the company s stock on the date of grant 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life
