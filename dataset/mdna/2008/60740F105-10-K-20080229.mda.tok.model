item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item a  risk factors 
the following discussion takes into account our acquisition on april   of the royal wolf companies 
the operations acquired are included in our operating results for the twelve months ended december  and only eight months of results of these acquired operations are included in the operating results for the twelve months ended december  as a result of this acquisition  we added two new locations in california  six locations in the united kingdom and a branch in the netherlands 
we also consolidated operations at locations in the united states where there was branch overlap as a result of the acquisition 
the results of operations for also include the four acquisitions and one start up location that we completed in overview general we derive most of our revenues from the leasing of portable storage containers and portable offices 
the average north america intended lease term at lease inception is approximately months for portable storage units 
table of contents and approximately months for portable offices 
in europe  our customers historically had been on a month to month basis 
our european operations have been transitioning to our business leasing model  and as a result  of our european leases at december  have intended lease terms at lease inception of approximately months for portable storage units 
in  the company wide over all lease term averaged months for portable storage units and months for portable offices 
as a result of these long average lease terms  our leasing business tends to provide us with a recurring revenue stream and minimizes fluctuations in revenues 
however  there is no assurance that we will maintain such lengthy overall lease terms 
in addition to our leasing business  we also sell portable storage containers and occasionally we sell portable office units 
our sales revenues as a percentage of total revenues have represented of revenues in our european subsidiaries  which in derived approximately of their revenues from container sales  have been transitioned to our leasing business model  but sales continue to be a large part of their revenues for the time being 
mobile mini has grown through both internally generated growth and acquisitions  which we use to gain a presence in new markets 
typically  we enter a new market through the acquisition of the business of a smaller local competitor and then apply our business model  which is usually much more customer service and marketing focused than the business we are buying or its competitors in the market 
if we cannot find a desirable acquisition opportunity in a market we wish to enter  we establish a new location from the ground up 
as a result  a new branch location will typically have fairly low operating margins during its early years  but as our marketing efforts help us penetrate the new market and we increase the number of units on rent at the new branch  we take advantage of operating efficiencies to improve operating margins at the branch and typically reach company average levels after several years 
when we enter a new market  we incur certain costs in developing an infrastructure 
for example  advertising and marketing costs will be incurred and certain minimum staffing levels and certain minimum levels of delivery equipment will be put in place regardless of the new market s revenue base 
once we have achieved revenues during any period that are sufficient to cover our fixed expenses  we generate high margins on incremental lease revenues 
therefore  each additional unit rented in excess of the break even level  contributes significantly to profitability 
conversely  additional fixed expenses that we incur require us to achieve additional revenue as compared to the prior period to cover the additional expense 
from through  we had not entered into as many new markets as we had in the earlier years or as we did in and  resulting in less downward pressure on our operating margins 
with the entry into eleven new markets in  particularly the seven branches that operate in europe  we added fixed costs to develop new branch infrastructure in and these additional costs include branch office and yard locations  marketing and advertising programs  delivery equipment  enterprise resource planning system and staffing requirements 
these expenses put some pressure on our operating margins in the fourth quarter of  and more pressure in this infrastructure will enable the new branches to complete the transition to our leasing business model  which should lead to more revenue growth and then slowly start increasing operating margins as we start realizing the benefits from incremental lease revenues 
we also have to staff our european headquarters that processes and tracks all of their leasing  sales and accounting transactions for consolidation with our north america operations 
among the external factors we examine to determine the direction of our business is the level of non residential construction activity  especially in areas of the country where we have a significant presence 
customers in the construction industry represented approximately and of our units on rent at december  and  respectively  and because of the degree of operating leverage we have  increases or declines in non residential construction activity can have a significant effect on our operating margins and net income 
in  after three years of very strong growth in non residential construction activity in the u 
s  the growth rate in this sector began to moderate and the level of our construction related business began to slowdown in certain geographic areas  particularly in the southeast and southwest 
we were able to offset a portion of these economic effects by continuing to gain market share for certain of our products  particularly our manufactured containers and portable offices  and by rapidly growing our base in europe and certain geographic areas in the us we believe that the uncertainty and caution that is apparent in the financial markets in the early part of  particularly as market conditions affect the availability of credit to finance construction projects  could continue to exert downward pressure on the levels of non residential construction activity 
in late and early  we notice a slowdown in the southeast and southwest regions 
this could have a material effect upon our results of operations 

table of contents in managing our business  we focus on our growth in leasing revenues  particularly in existing markets where we can take advantage of the operating leverage inherent in our business model 
mobile mini s goal is to maintain a high growth rate so that revenue growth will exceed inflationary growth in expenses 
we are a capital intensive business  so in addition to focusing on earnings per share  we focus on adjusted ebitda to measure our results 
we calculate this number by first calculating ebitda  which we define as net income before interest expense  debt restructuring or extinguishment expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
this measure eliminates the effect of financing transactions that we enter into on an irregular basis based on capital needs and market opportunities  and this measure provides us with a means to track internally generated cash from which we can fund our interest expense and our lease fleet growth 
in comparing ebitda from year to year  we typically further adjust ebitda to ignore the effect of what we consider non recurring events not related to our core business operations to arrive at what we define as adjusted ebitda 
the non recurring events reflected in the adjusted ebitda are the effect in of our florida litigation expense  which was concluded in  and  in  for losses incurred related to hurricane katrina and the proceeds received from a third party related to a settlement agreement in connection with the florida litigation 
in  with the adoption of sfas no 
r  when we calculated adjusted ebitda  we also excluded share based compensation expense in comparing adjusted ebitda to other periods 
under apb opinion no 
 we did not recognize compensation expense in connection with stock option awards in years prior to because ebitda is a non gaap financial measure  as defined by the sec  we include in this report reconciliations of ebitda to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these reconciliations are included in item  selected financial data 
in managing our business  we routinely compare our adjusted ebitda margins from year to year and based upon age of branch 
we define this margin as adjusted ebitda divided by our total revenues  expressed as a percentage 
we use this comparison  for example  to study internally the effect that increased costs have on our margins 
as capital is invested in our established branch locations  we achieve higher adjusted ebitda margins on that capital than we achieve on capital invested to establish a new branch  because our fixed costs are already in place in connection with the established branches 
the fixed costs are those associated with yard and delivery equipment  as well as advertising  sales  marketing and office expenses 
with a new market or branch  we must first fund and absorb the startup costs for setting up the new branch facility  hiring and developing the management and sales team and developing our marketing and advertising programs 
a new branch will have low adjusted ebitda margins in its early years until the number of units on rent increases 
because of our high operating margins on incremental lease revenue  which we realize on a branch by branch basis when the branch achieves leasing revenues sufficient to cover the branch s fixed costs  leasing revenues in excess of the break even amount produce large increases in profitability 
conversely  absent significant growth in leasing revenues  the adjusted ebitda margin at a branch will remain relatively flat on a period by period comparative basis 
accounting and operating overview our leasing revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our portable storage  combination storage office and mobile office units 
our sales revenues include sales of these units to customers 
our other revenues consist principally of charges for the delivery of the units we sell 
our principal operating expenses are cost of sales  leasing  selling and general expenses  and depreciation and amortization  primarily depreciation of the portable storage units and portable offices in our lease fleet 
cost of sales is the cost of the units that we sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy  transport  refurbish and modify used ocean going containers and our cost to manufacture portable storage units and other structures 
leasing  selling and general expenses include among other expenses  advertising and other marketing expenses  real property lease expenses  commissions  repair and maintenance costs of our lease fleet and transportation equipment and corporate expenses for both our leasing and sales activities 
annual repair and maintenance expenses on our leased units over the last three years have averaged approximately of lease revenues and are included in leasing  selling and general expenses 
we expense our normal repair and maintenance costs as incurred including the cost of periodically repainting units 
our principal asset is our lease fleet  which has historically maintained value close to its original cost 
the steel units in our lease fleet other than van trailers are depreciated on the straight line method using an estimated useful 
table of contents life of years  after the date the unit is placed in service  with an estimated residual value of 
the depreciation policy is supported by our historical lease fleet data which shows that we have been able to obtain comparable rental rates and sales prices irrespective of the age of our container lease fleet 
our wood mobile office units are depreciated over years to of original cost 
van trailers  which constitute a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers  which are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses  are of much lower quality than storage containers and consequently depreciate more rapidly 
see item business product lives and durability 
our expansion program and other factors can affect our overall utilization rate 
during the last five years  our annual utilization levels averaged  and ranged from a low of in to a high of in our utilization level averaged during since  we have increased our total lease fleet from  units to  units  representing a cagr of 
results of operations the following table shows the percentage of total revenues represented by the key items that make up our statements of income  certain amounts may not add due to rounding year ended december  revenues leasing sales other total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales leasing  selling and general expenses florida litigation expense depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest income other income interest expense debt restructuring expense foreign currency exchange gain income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in leasing of portable storage units and portable offices accounted for approximately of total revenues during leasing revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted from a increase in the average rental yield per unit  a increase in the average number of units on lease and increase due to favorable exchange rates  in each case as compared to the same period in the increase in yield resulted from an increase in average rental rates over the prior year  an increase 
table of contents in revenue for ancillary rental services  such as delivery charges and continued change in the mix of units being added to our fleet 
we have added more premium containers and portable wood offices to the lease fleet in recent periods for which we obtain higher rental rates than basic storage units 
the portable offices we have added to our lease fleet in recent quarters have on average been larger units that command high rents 
these higher lease rates were partially offset by lower rental rates on units added through acquisitions that continue on lease  including europe  which on the average are smaller  were not refurbished and were primarily storage containers rather than portable offices 
in  our leasing revenue growth rate was as compared to in the leasing revenue growth rate during the four quarters of was   and  respectively 
the fourth quarter growth rate was negatively impacted by several factors  including the general slowdown in non residential construction during the second half of and a planned significant reduction in our seasonal storage business compared to levels 
we opened four new branches in two new locations in the united states and two in canada 
we also completed another acquisition in in which we consolidated the acquired business operations into our existing pensacola  florida operations 
our sales of portable storage and office units accounted for in and in  of our total revenues 
other revenues  primarily related to our sales business and principally arising from transportation charges for the delivery of units sold and the sale of ancillary products represented of total revenues in and in our revenues from the sale of portable storage units increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is primarily related to the higher level of sales activity at our newer locations both in the united states and especially in europe which only had eight months reported in our leasing business continues to be our primary focus and leasing revenues have become the predominant part of our revenue mix over the past several years 
we expect this trend to continue as our european branches scale down their sales activity and trend to our leasing business model 
cost of sales are the costs related to our sales revenue only 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenue increased to in from in the decrease in the gross margin results in large part from the additional sales associated with our european operations where many of our units are sold at wholesale and sales margins tend to be lower than in the us leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were and in and  respectively 
in  our margins were affected by the costs associated with developing infrastructure to support our united kingdom operations  higher delivery and freight costs  employee stock based compensation expense  higher fleet repair and maintenance expense  and expenses that vary in relation to revenue growth 
we generally anticipate that a new branch will first achieve a positive operating margin after approximately months of operations 
in the united kingdom  this ramp up was more pronounced than our historical experience  because the operating model of our predecessor featured outsourced storage yards and third party delivery equipment 
consequently we needed to acquire properties from which to operate our branches  delivery equipment with which to operate our business  and sales employees to drive demand for our products 
during  delivery and freight costs  including fuel  increased by million over  as fuel prices increased and we used more third party vendors for the transportation of our units  particularly our modular office units increased costs were passed on to customers in the form of higher delivery and pick up charges 
included in leasing  selling and general expense is approximately million and million in and  respectively  of expenses related to share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  which became effective for us on january  in addition  the other major increases in leasing  selling and general expenses for were repairs on our lease fleet  including costs related to our office units  increased by million due to costs associated with repairing hurricane damaged units and a larger number of mobile offices maintaining our higher overall utilization and repairs and maintenance of delivery and other equipment increased by million principally as a result of our preventative maintenance programs and general repairs associated with servicing a larger lease fleet and payroll and related expenses increased by million and included increased commissions paid on increased revenues as well as general wage increases 
ebitda increased million  or  to million in from million in depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the higher depreciation expense is primarily due to the growth in our lease fleet over the prior year to meet increased demand of our products and included the depreciation of units acquired through 
table of contents acquisitions in both and it also includes the depreciation expenses associated with the portable storage units added to the lease fleet during and the inclusion in the lease fleet of additional wood modular offices which have a higher depreciation rate than our steel units 
also  in and  depreciation expense includes the related depreciation on the additions to property  plant and equipment  primarily trucks  forklifts and trailers  to support the lease fleet growth  and the customized enterprise resource planning system to enhance our reporting environment 
this increase in our lease fleet enabled us to achieve our higher lease revenues 
since december   our lease fleet cost basis for depreciation increased by million 
see critical accounting policies and estimates within this item interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in our monthly weighted average debt outstanding during  compared to  increased while our average borrowing rate declined slightly in  compared to the prior year level 
in  we redeemed million of our senior notes and issued million of senior notes  that were issued at of par 
in  we paid down million of our higher interest rate senior notes 
during  we invested million in net additions to our lease fleet and million in acquisitions 
these additions were funded through cash flow from operations and additional borrowings 
the monthly weighted average interest rate on our debt was for compared to for  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs  the monthly weighted average interest rate was in and in our weighted average interest rate is lower  in part  because we redeemed our higher interest rate senior notes in may see liquidity and capital resources within this item debt extinguishment expense for the period resulted from the write off of the remaining unamortized deferred loan costs and the redemption premium on million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes redeemed in the second quarter of for the period  this expense represents the portion of deferred loan costs and the redemption premium on million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes redeemed in may provision for income taxes was based on an annual effective tax rate of for as compared to an annual effective tax rate of for our consolidated tax provision includes the expected tax rates for our operations in the united states  canada  united kingdom and the netherlands 
the tax provision includes a million tax benefit due to the recognition of certain state net operating loss carryforwards that were previously scheduled to expire in at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which expires if unused from to in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards in the various states in which we operate 
we believe  based on internal projections  that we will generate sufficient taxable income needed to realize the corresponding federal and state deferred tax assets to the extent they are recorded as deferred tax assets in our balance sheet 
net income in was million  as compared to million in our net income results were primarily achieved by our increase in revenues and the operating leverage associated with this growth 
these increases were partially offset by the million  million after tax  charge for debt extinguishment expense related to the redemption of our outstanding senior notes 
our net income was partially offset by the million million after tax  tax debt extinquishment expenses related to the partial redemption of our senor notes and includes a million tax benefit due to the expected recognition of certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in leasing of portable storage units and portable offices accounted for approximately of total revenues during leasing revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted from a increase in the average rental yield per unit  a increase in the average number of units on lease and increase due to favorable exchange rates  in each case as compared to the same period in the increase in yield resulted from an increase in average rental rates over the prior year and an increase in revenue for ancillary rental services  such as delivery charges 
an increase in the mix of premium units having higher rental rates which we added to our fleet was offset by lower rental rates on units added through 
table of contents acquisitions  especially in europe  which on the average are smaller  were not refurbished and were primarily storage containers rather than portable offices 
excluding our european operations  our average rental yield per unit increased in compared to in  our lease revenue growth rate was as compared to in we opened eleven new branches through acquisitions in four in the united states  six in the united kingdom and one in the netherlands 
we also completed another acquisition in in which we consolidated the acquired business operations into our existing pensacola  florida operations 
our sales of portable storage and office units accounted for and in and  respectively  of our total revenues 
other revenues  primarily related to our sales business and principally arising from transportation charges for the delivery of units sold and the sale of ancillary products represented of total revenues in both and our revenues from the sale of portable storage units increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is primarily related to the higher level of sales activity at our newer locations both in the united states and especially in europe 
our leasing business continues to be our primary focus and leasing revenues have become the predominant part of our revenue mix over the past several years 
cost of sales are the costs related to our sales revenue only 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenue increased to in from in our gross margin was at a higher than typical level during both periods 
the slight decrease in the gross margin results from our european operations where many of our units were sold at wholesale 
leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were and in and  respectively 
included in this expense for  is approximately million of expenses related to share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  which became effective for us on january  the expense amount includes million related to hurricane katrina 
excluding these items  our leasing  selling and general expenses would have increased by million  or  to million in  as compared to million in as the markets we entered in the past few years have continued to mature and as their revenues have increased to cover our fixed expenses at those locations  those markets have produced high margins on incremental lease revenues 
each additional unit on lease in excess of the break even level contributes significantly to profitability 
over the next year  we anticipate our leasing  selling and general expenses will increase modestly as we add more infrastructure to the seven european and four united states branches acquired in  to support their transformation to our business model 
in addition to the share based compensation expense  the major increase in leasing  selling and general expenses for were payroll and related expenses increased by million and included the increase in commissions we paid our sales personnel related to the million increase in revenues and general wage increases for over  employees who support the growth of our leasing activities  delivery and freight costs  including fuel  increased by million as fuel prices increased and we used more third party vendors for the transportation of our units  particularly our modular office units increased costs were passed on to customers in the form of higher delivery and pick up charges  repairs on our lease fleet  including costs related to our office units  increased by million due to our increased maintenance efforts associated with maintaining our higher overall utilization rates and the higher cost associated with maintaining mobile offices  and repairs and maintenance of delivery and other equipment increased by million principally as a result of our preventative maintenance programs and general repairs associated with servicing a larger lease fleet 
ebitda increased million  or  to million in from million in ebitda  adjusted to exclude million of share based compensation expense in and hurricane katrina expenses of million and million of other income in  increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the higher depreciation expense is primarily due to the growth in our lease fleet over the prior year to meet increased demand of our products and included the depreciation or units acquired through acquisitions in it also includes the depreciation expenses associated with the refurbishment of portable storage units added to the lease fleet during and the inclusion in the lease fleet of additional wood modular offices which have a higher depreciation rate than our steel units 
also  in  depreciation expense includes the related depreciation on the additions to property  plant and equipment  primarily trucks  forklifts and trailers  to 
table of contents support the lease fleet growth  and the customized enterprise resource planning system to enhance our reporting environment 
this increase in our lease fleet enabled us to achieve our higher lease revenues 
since december   our lease fleet cost basis for depreciation increased by million 
see critical accounting policies and estimates within this item other income in  represents net proceeds of a settlement agreement pursuant to which a third party reimbursed us for a portion of losses sustained in two lawsuits that arose in connection with the acquisition in april of a portable storage business in florida 
interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in our monthly weighted average debt outstanding during  compared to  was virtually unchanged due to our equity offering 
this slight increase in interest expense in resulted primarily from higher interest rates on our variable rate line of credit  which was offset by the interest savings resulting from the redemption of million of our senior notes in may during  we invested million in net additions to our lease fleet and million in acquisitions 
these additions were funded through cash flow from operations  use of a portion of the proceeds of an equity offering  and additional borrowings 
the monthly weighted average interest rate on our debt was for both and  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs  the monthly weighted average interest rate was to both and our weighted average interest rate is slightly higher in primarily due to higher libor rates in effect during  partially offset by lower spreads from libor on our line of credit due to our improved leverage ratio 
in addition  our weighted average interest rate is reduced as a larger percentage of our borrowing comes from our lower rate revolving line of credit 
interest costs include interest related to our senior notes that bear interest at per annum  which was higher than the average borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility 
debt extinguishment expense in the period represents the portion of deferred loan costs and the redemption premium on of the million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes that we redeemed in may provision for income taxes was based on an annual effective tax rate of for as compared to an annual effective tax rate of for our consolidated tax provision includes the expected tax rates for our operations in the united states  canada  united kingdom and the netherlands

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity summary most of our capital needs are discretionary and are used principally to acquire additional units for our lease fleet 
leasing is a capital intensive business that requires us to acquire assets before they generate revenues  cash flow and earnings 
the assets which we lease have very long useful lives and require relatively little recurrent maintenance expenditures 
most of the capital we deploy into our leasing business has been used to expand our operations geographically  to increase the number of units available for lease at our leasing locations  and to add to the mix of products we offer 
during recent years our operations have generated annual cash flow that exceeds our pre tax earnings  particularly due to the deferral of income taxes caused by accelerated depreciation that is used for tax accounting 
during the second quarter of  we redeemed million principal amount of our issued and outstanding senior notes due on may   we completed the offering of our million principal amount senior notes due  issued at of par value  through a private placement to institutional investors 
subsequently  the private placement notes were exchanged for a like amount of senior notes with identical terms pursuant to an exchange offer registered under the securities act of we received net proceeds of approximately million  after underwriters discounts and commissions  from our issuance of the million senior notes 
we used these proceeds to redeem the million principal balance of our senior notes  and paid accrued interest  transaction costs and the redemption premium approximately million on the senior notes 
we used the remaining net proceeds of approximately million to repay borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
on may   we amended our senior secured revolving line of credit to provide a million revolving credit facility  which is scheduled to mature in may we may also  at our option and without lenders consent  increase available borrowings under the revolving credit facility by an additional million during the term of the agreement 
during the past two years  our capital expenditures and acquisitions have been funded by our operating cash flow  an offering of shares of our common stock in march  which provided us approximately million of net proceeds  our may offering of senior notes  and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our operating cash flow is  in general  weakest during the first quarter of each fiscal year  when customers who leased containers for holiday storage return the units 
at december   we had unused borrowing availability of approximately million under our revolving credit facility 
our net borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility increased by million  from million at december  to million at december  the net additional borrowings  which were offset by the million paydown of our revolving credit agreement in may utilizing a portion of the proceeds of the senior note issuance  were used  in conjunction with cash provided by operating activities  to fund the million of additions to our lease fleet  purchase property  plant and equipment of million  to fund the purchase price related to acquisitions in totaling million and to repurchase million of our common stock 
as of february   borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility were approximately million 
operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million in as compared to million in and million in the million increase in over in cash provided by operating activities  in addition to increased pre tax income and the related deferral of the income taxes  included the increase of a non cash charge of million related to share based compensation expense  and a million increase in non cash debt extinguishment expense relating to the redemption of our senior notes 
in  cash provided by operating activities was negatively affected by the million premium paid in connection with redeeming million of our senior notes 
in  cash provided by operating activities was negatively affected by the million premium paid in connection with redeeming of our senior notes  while in cash provided by operating activities was positively influenced by the receipt of million of other income 
additionally  in  cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by increases in accounts receivable which was due to the general growth in our leasing activities by an increase in our sales activity related to our newly acquired european operations  and by an increase in deposits and prepaid expenses 
in  accounts payable increased by million  while in  accounts payable decreased million primarily due to the 
table of contents timing of vendor payment requirements 
cash provided by operating activities is enhanced by the deferral of most income taxes due to the rapid tax depreciation rate of our assets and our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a net deferred tax liability of million 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in in  million of cash was paid for acquisition of businesses  compared to million in and million in capital expenditures for our lease fleet  net of proceeds from sale of lease fleet units  were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures decreased almost in  with the decrease occurring primarily in the fourth quarter due to the economic slow down 
additions to the lease fleet included refurbishment of prior acquisition units and our steel and wood offices 
during the past several years we have increased the customization of our fleet  enabling us to differentiate our product from our competitors product  and we have complimented our lease fleet by adding wood mobile offices 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  net of proceeds from any sale of property  plant and equipment  were million in  million in and million in the million net increase for property  plant and equipment  of which million was spent in europe  was primarily for new delivery equipment and forklifts at our newer branches and additional hardware and software in conjunction with our upgraded computer information systems 
the amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management s discretion 
mobile mini has no contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we are required to purchase a fixed or minimum amount of goods or services in connection with any portion of our business 
maintenance capital expenditures is the cost to replace old forklifts  trucks and trailers that we use to move and deliver our products to our customers  and for enhancements to our computer information systems 
our maintenance capital expenditures were approximately million in  million in and million in financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in in  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the equity offering and we redeemed million or of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of our senior notes 
during  in addition to our equity offering  we relied on cash provided by operations as well as our revolving credit facility to provide the additional capital needed to fund the growth of our lease fleet and to complete certain acquisitions 
additionally  we received million  million and million from the exercises of employee stock options and the related tax benefits in  and  respectively 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and approximately million of additional borrowings were available to us under the facility 
as of february   our borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility were approximately million 
loans under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate based  at our option and subject to our leverage ratio  on either the prime rate plus a spread ranging from negative to  or libor  plus a spread ranging from to 
the interest rate spread from the libor rate and prime rate is measured at the end of each quarter 
interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly or  with respect to libor borrowings  either quarterly or on the last day of the applicable interest period whichever is more frequent 
in addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal amount  we pay an unused revolving credit facility fee to the senior lenders equal to a range of to per annum on the unused daily balance of the revolving credit commitment  payable monthly in arrears  based upon the actual number of days elapsed in a day year 
for each letter of credit we issue  we pay i a per annum fee equal to the margin over the libor rate from time to time in effect  ii a fronting fee on the aggregate outstanding stated amounts of such letters of credit  plus iii customary administrative charges 
all of our obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed jointly and severally by each of our subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility and the related guarantees are secured by substantially all of our assets and all assets of each guarantor  including but not limited to i a first priority pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock or other ownership interest owned by us and each guarantor and ii first priority security interests in all of our tangible and intangible assets and the tangible and intangible assets of each guarantor in each case  other than certain equipment assets subject to capitalized lease obligations 
as of december   we had minor capital lease obligations relating to office equipment 

table of contents our revolving credit agreement imposes some material covenants that restrict us in the conduct of our business  although certain covenants are inapplicable in whole or in part as long as we are not in default under the agreement and we maintain borrowing availability in excess of certain pre determined levels 
if our borrowing availability is below a specified level  the revolving credit facility triggers covenants restricting or in some cases  further restricting our ability to  among other things i declare cash dividends  or redeem or repurchase our capital stock in excess of million  ii prepay  redeem or purchase other debt  iii incur liens  iv make loans and investments  v incur additional indebtedness  vi amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements  vii make capital expenditures  viii engage in mergers  acquisitions and asset sales  ix transact with affiliates  and x alter the business we conduct 
we also must comply with specified financial covenants and affirmative covenants 
should we fall below specified borrowing availability levels  then these financial covenants would set maximum permitted values for our leverage ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio and our minimum required utilization rates 
our compliance with financial covenants is measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement  we were in compliance with all the covenants at december  events of default under the revolving credit facility include  but are not limited to  i our failure to timely pay principal or interest under the facility when due  ii our material breach of any representations or warranty  iii covenant defaults  iv events of bankruptcy  v cross default under certain other debt instruments  vi certain unsatisfied final judgments over a stated threshold amount  and vii a change of control 
at december   we had five interest rate swap agreements for a total of million of debt 
two of these agreements covering a total of million of debt expire during february we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the interest rate so that the rate is payable based upon a spread from fixed rates  rather than a spread from the libor rate 
at december   million of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at fixed rates or the rate is effectively fixed due to a swap agreement  and approximately million of borrowings under our credit facility are variable rate 
accounting for these swap agreements is covered by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
we believe we have sufficient borrowings available under the million revolving credit facility to provide for our normal capital needs for the next to months  with the duration dependent in large part upon the balance between the internal growth rates achieved during and subsequent periods and the expenses of entering into additional markets during the period  which will be the main determinant of how quickly we use our additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
with the closing of the definitive merger agreement announced in february  we will have secured a billion asset based revolving credit facility to allow for increased borrowing capability after paying merger costs and repayment of indebtedness 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations primarily consist of our outstanding balance under our secured revolving credit facility and million of senior notes  together with other unsecured notes payable obligations and small obligations under capital leases 
we also have operating lease commitments for real estate properties for the majority of our branches with remaining lease terms on our major leased properties ranging from to years  delivery  transportation and yard equipment  typically under a five year lease with purchase options at the end of the lease term at a stated or fair market value price  and other equipment  primarily office machines 
at december   in connection with the issuance of our insurance policies  we provided certain insurance carriers with approximately million in letters of credit and an agreement under which we are contingently responsible for million in order to provide credit support for our payment of the deductibles and or loss limitation reimbursements under the insurance policies 
we currently do not have any obligations under purchase agreements or commitments 
historically  we enter into capitalized lease obligations from time to time to purchase delivery  transportation and yard equipment and currently have small commitments recorded as capital leases relating to some office equipment 

table of contents the table below provides a summary of our contractual commitments as of december  the operating lease amounts include certain real estate leases that expire in  but have lease renewal options that we currently anticipate to exercise in at the end of the initial lease period

seasonality demand from some of our customers is somewhat seasonal 
demand for leases of our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from september through december because these retailers need to store more inventories for the holiday season 
our retail customers usually return these leased units to us early in the following year 
this causes lower utilization rates for our lease fleet and a marginal decrease in cash flow during the first quarter of the year 
over the last few years  we have reduced the percentage of our units we reserve for this seasonal business from the levels we allocated in earlier years  decreasing our seasonality 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  some of which require significant judgment 

table of contents mobile mini s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon our evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events  and these estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition 
lease and leasing ancillary revenues and related expenses generated under portable storage units and office units are recognized on a straight line basis 
revenues and expenses from portable storage unit delivery and hauling are recognized when these services are earned  in accordance with sab no 
we recognize revenues from sales of containers and mobile office units upon delivery when the risk of loss passes  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we sell our products pursuant to sales contracts stating the fixed sales price with our customers 
share based compensation 
prior to fiscal  we accounted for stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock based compensation transactions in the statement of income 
the fair value of our stock based awards is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our stock based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little stock based compensation cost 
for stock options and nonvested share awards subject solely to service conditions  we recognize expense using the straight line attribution method 
for nonvested share awards subject to service and performance conditions  we are required to assess the probability that such performance conditions will be met 
if the likelihood of the performance condition being met is deemed probable  we will recognize the expense using accelerated attribution method 
in addition  for both stock options and nonvested share awards  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different 
we had approximately million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options at december  that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested share awards at december  that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to the consolidated financial statement for a further discussion on stock based compensation 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we establish and maintain reserves against estimated losses based upon historical loss experience and evaluation of past due accounts agings 
management reviews the level of the allowances for doubtful accounts on a regular basis and adjusts the level of the allowances as needed 
if we were to increase the factors used for our reserve estimates by  it would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted earnings per share at december  as follows years ended december  in thousands except per share data as reported net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for hypothetical change in reserve estimates net income diluted earnings per share if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of goodwill we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or general economic trends 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we operate on one reportable segment  which is comprised of three reporting units with the addition of our european operations 
we perform an annual impairment test on goodwill using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
in addition  we will perform impairment tests during any reporting period in which events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have incurred 
we performed the required impairment tests for goodwill as of december  and determined that goodwill is not impaired and it is not necessary to record any impairment losses related to goodwill 
we will continue to perform this test in the future as required by sfas no 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review property  plant and equipment and intangibles with finite lives those assets resulting from acquisitions for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for its estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  whether due to new information or other factors  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
depreciation policy 
our depreciation policy for our lease fleet uses the straight line method over our units estimated useful life  after the date that we put the unit in service 
our steel units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
wood offices units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
van trailers  which are a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses 
in  we modified our depreciation policy on our steel units to increase the useful life to years from years  and to decrease the residual value to from  which effectively resulted in continued depreciation on steel units for five additional years at the same annual rate 
this change was made to reflect 
table of contents that some of our steel units have now been in our lease fleet longer than years and these units continue to be effective income producing assets that do not show signs of reaching the end of their useful life 
the depreciation policy is supported by our historical lease fleet data that shows we have been able to retain comparable rental rates and sales prices irrespective of the age of the unit in our container lease fleet 
we periodically review our depreciation policy against various factors  including the results of our lenders independent appraisal of our lease fleet  practices of the larger competitors in our industry  profit margins we are achieving on sales of depreciated units and lease rates we obtain on older units 
if we were to change our depreciation policy on our steel units from residual value and a year life to a lower or higher residual and a shorter or longer useful life  such change could have a positive  negative or neutral effect on our earnings  with the actual effect being determined by the change 
for example  a change in our estimates used in our residual values and useful life on our steel units would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted earnings per share as reflected in the table below 
useful residual life in value years in thousands except per share data as reported net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share insurance reserves 
our worker s compensation  auto and general liability insurance are purchased under large deductible programs 
our current per incident deductibles are worker s compensation  auto  and general liability  we provide for the estimated expense relating to the deductible portion of the individual claims 
however  we generally do not know the full amount of our exposure to a deductible in connection with any particular claim during the fiscal period in which the claim is incurred and for which we must make an accrual for the deductible expense 
we make these accruals based on a combination of the claims development experience of our staff and our insurance companies  and  at year end  the accrual is reviewed and adjusted  in part  based on an independent actuarial review of historical loss data and using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
a high degree of judgment is required in developing these estimates of amounts to be accrued  as well as in connection with the underlying assumptions 
in addition  our assumptions will change as our loss experience is developed 
all of these factors have the potential for significantly impacting the amounts we have previously reserved in respect of anticipated deductible expenses  and we may be required in the future to increase or decrease amounts previously accrued 
contingencies 
we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for 
table of contents which our management can determine that it is probable as that term is defined in sfas no 
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of incurred and possible range of loss on pending claims and litigation  management must use considerable judgment in making reasonable determination of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation 
we do not anticipate the resolution of such matters known at this time will have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position 
deferred taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for each jurisdiction  we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense or offset goodwill if the deferred tax asset was acquired in a business combination 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense except if the valuation allowance was created in conjunction with a tax asset in a business combination 
at december   we have a million valuation allowance and have million of deferred tax assets included within the net deferred tax liability on our balance sheet 
the majority of deferred tax asset relates to federal net operating loss carryforwards that have future expiration dates 
management currently believes that adequate future taxable income will be generated through future operations and or through available tax planning strategies to recover these assets 
however  given that these loss carryforwards that give rise to the deferred tax asset expire over years beginning in  there could be changes in management s judgment in future periods with respect to the recoverability of these assets 
as of december   management believes that it is more likely than not that the unreserved portion of these deferred tax assets will be recovered 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate swap agreement 
we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates through a financial arrangement intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
interest rate swap agreements are the only instruments we use to manage interest rate fluctuations affecting our variable rate debt 
at december   we had five interest rate swap agreements under which we pay a fixed rate and receive a variable interest rate on million of debt 
in  in accordance with sfas no 
 comprehensive income included a charge of million  net of income tax benefit of million  related to the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements 
we enter into derivative financial arrangements only to the extent that the arrangement meets the objectives described  and we do not engage in such transactions for speculative purposes 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our debt portfolio total at total fair value at december  december  at december  thereafter in thousands  except percentages debt fixed rate average interest rate floating rate average interest rate operating leases 
table of contents included in our floating rate line of credit facility are million of fixed rate swap agreements with a weighted average interest rate of that mature between and impact of foreign currency rate changes 
we currently have branch operations outside the united states and we bill those customers primarily in their local currency which is subject to foreign currency rate changes 
our operations in canada are billed in the canadian dollar  operations in the united kingdom are billed in pound sterling and operations in the netherlands are billed in the eurodollar 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our non united states operations are translated into us dollars 
the impact of foreign currency rate changes has historically been insignificant with our canadian operations  but we have more exposure to volatility with our european operations 
in order to help minimize our exchange rate gain and loss volatility  we finance our european entities through our revolving line of credit which allows us to also borrow those funds in pound sterling denominated debt
