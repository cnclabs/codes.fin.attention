item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsexecutive summary the year marked our first full year as a publicly traded company and produced our best ever operating results 
consistent with our year operating history  we continued to grow our business in the rapidly expanding battery and supply chain management industries 
our overall revenue growth over was  as it historically has been  totally organic in nature and was accomplished by executing on key growth stratgies such as increasing our penetration of new and existing customer accounts  diversifying our product mix and expanding our geographic reach 
we believe the revenue growth in over in our non brinks battery and battery related business reflects more focused marketing efforts and increased customer penetration 
we also expanded our battery  charger and portable power product lines to better meet the evolving needs of our customers and  ultimately  the end consumer 
on the other hand  going forward  we will continue to capitalize on favorable industry trends  such as the growing demand for productivity and portability in the consumer electronics industry as well as third party logistics opportunities 
our geographic reach was expanded with the launch of our fourth logistics center  located in columbus  georgia 
the new logistics center not only improves transit times and service opportunities in the south eastern markets  but provides new revenue opportunities through targeted regional sales efforts 
we intend to launch additional logistics centers in the near future 
while s financial results were comparatively strong  the year was not without its challenges 
throughout the full year  we faced higher raw material costs as prices of lead  copper and zinc reached new levels 
even though we were able to pass through most of the raw material price increases  our margins were impacted 
our brinks home security business grew at a slower than historical pace  with sales to brinks and their dealers up in  which was offset by the significant growth and strength of our other battery and related business 
we also absorbed substantial additional costs that come with being a public company 
despite these challenges  we were able to deliver strong financial results to our shareholders 
in addition to targeted organic growth  acquisitions remain a significant component of our expansion initiatives and growth plans 
we continue to diligently evaluate markets and suitable acquisition candidates that will facilitate reaching our strategic objectives 
during we initiated our sarbanes oxley compliance plan and incurred approximately  in related costs  primarily during the fourth quarter 
as of december  we had incurred approximately of anticipated implementation costs and had substantially completed implementation of our compliance plan 
as we enter into  we remain optimistic  opportunistic and very positive about our future 
we have made and will continue to make the necessary investments in our infrastructure  namely  our distribution facilities  our warehouse management system and our people  to support and facilitate our immediate and long term growth objectives 
for the full year  our revenues increased to million  up million  or  from million for our operating income rose to million in  up million from million in our net income rose to million in  up million from million in our results included a million non cash charge against operating income for stock based compensation compared to million in our revenues from sources other than brinks and their dealers rose to million from million for  reflecting growth of new and existing customer accounts as well as price increases implemented by us to offset higher costs of goods sold 
growth in our higher margin business for was driven approximately by volume and by price increases 
revenues from brinks and their dealers increased to million  up compared to million for we believe this modest increase partially reflects slower growth in the residential housing market 
gross margin improved as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  to compared to for the comparable period in this increase in gross margin generally reflects product mix improvement as well as price increases to offset higher raw material costs 
we continue to focus on and develop higher margin products and markets 
as mentioned above  the industry continues to experience significant volatility in certain raw materials 
as raw material prices are expected to remain volatile during  we will continue recovering these increases from our customers wherever possible 
currently  there is no indication that we will not be able to obtain supplies of all the materials that we require 
maintaining and growing our gross margins will continue to be more challenging while prices for raw materials are volatile 
a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition follows results of operations year ended december  compared to december revenues net revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to net revenues of million for the similar period in  an increase of million  or 
in the period  our non brinks sales of batteries  battery related and battery powered products increased by million  or from sales to brinks  including their dealers  was million compared to million in the period  an increase of million  or

cost of sales totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million in the comparable period  an increase of million  or

the increase is due primarily to interest totaling million paid on the notes payable to zunicom 
for the year ended december  the average outstanding loan balance on our line of credit was million  compared to million for the year ended december  we expect interest expense to continue to increase as a result of the potential for a higher level of debt on our working capital line to finance growth and or acquisitions and to make payments on the notes payable to zunicom totaling million and million  respectively  as of december  comparison of years ended december  and revenues net revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to net revenues of million for the similar period in  an increase of million  or

historically  our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
our first and fourth fiscal quarters are traditionally weaker compared to the second and third fiscal quarters 
this trend depends on numerous factors including the markets in which we operate  holiday seasons  climate and general economic conditions 
many of the products that we distribute are tied closely to consumer demands  which may be volatile and which are always impacted by general economic conditions 
our ability to predict these trends or estimate their impact on our business is limited 
as a result  we cannot assure that these historical patterns will continue in future periods 
the electronic components and the electronics distribution industries have historically been cyclical in nature with significant volatility within the cycles 
we believe this cyclicality and volatility will continue 
international currency fluctuation the goods that we purchase from asia are subject to international currency fluctuations 
management does not believe that the fluctuation in currency presents a serious threat to its operations 
see item a for further discussion 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company is a distributor who purchases both finished goods and components from domestic and international suppliers 
the company adds value to products and components by packaging them in customer specified kits or tailor made units that are convenient for the customer to order and ship 
additionally  the company has several customers that require specific battery solutions for inclusion in their own products 
the company will obtain the battery and necessary components and configure a new finished good unit based upon customer specifications 
the company refers to this process as a value added service 
the company recognizes sales of finished goods at the time the customer takes title to the product 
the company sells products to several customers in bulk quantities 
the company obtains the order from the customer and arranges for the delivery of the product directly from the company s vendor to the customer to reduce freight costs and wear and tear on the product from excessive handling 
the company refers to these transactions as drop shipments because the product is shipped directly from the company s vendor to the company s customer 
the company also has an inventory fulfillment agreement with brinks 
the company purchases  handles  assembles and delivers installation components and tooling to brinks and to independent brinks authorized dealers 
revenues from drop shipment transactions and pursuant to the agreement with brinks are recognized on a gross basis at the time the customer takes title to the product based on the company s analysis of the criteria defined in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
for gross revenue reporting 
specifically  i the company is the primary obligor  ii the company has general and physical loss inventory risk  iii the company has credit risk  iv in most cases  the company has discretion in supplier selection and product specifications  and v the company has reasonable latitude within economic constraints to negotiate prices and terms with its customers 
income taxes in january  the company adopted the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements 
fin requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on the recognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
the company did not recognize any adjustments to the financial statements as a result of our implementation of fin the company utilizes the asset and liability approach to accounting and reporting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company uses an estimate of its annual income tax rate to recognize a provision for income taxes in financial statements for interim periods 
however  changes in facts and circumstances could result in adjustments to the company s effective tax rate in future quarterly or annual periods 
stock based compensation on january   we began accounting for stock options under the provisions of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions for fas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair vlaue of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
we have used the black scholes valuation model to estimate fair value of our stock based awards wich requires various judgemental assumptions including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 
our computation of expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility 
in adition  we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeiturs and expected life  including types of awards  employee class and historical experience 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we adopted fas r using the modified prospective method which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january  in accordance with the modified prospective method  the financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of fas r 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  on december   the fasb issued fsp fas b which would delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilites  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this proposed fsp partially defers the effective date of statement to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
effective for  we will adopt sfas except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilites as noted in the proposed fsp fas b 
the partial adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  management is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas will have on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas the provisions of sfas r are similar to those of sfas  however  sfas r requires companies to record most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired in a business combination at full fair value 
sfas r also requires companies to record fair value estimates of contingent consideration and certain other potential liabilities during the original purchase price allocation and to expense acquisition costs as incurred 
this statement applies to all business combinations  including combinations by contract alone 
further  under sfas r  all business combinations will be accounted for by applying the acquisition method 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the provisions of sfas r will impact the company if it is a party to a business combination after the pronouncement is adopted 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas  which will require noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be treated as a separate component of equity  not as a liability or other item outside of permanent equity 
this statement applies to the accounting for noncontrolling interests and transactions with noncontrolling interest holders in consolidated financial statements 
sfas is effective for periods beginning on or after december  sfas will be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests  including any that arose before the effective date except that comparative period information must be recast to classify noncontrolling interests in equity  attribute net income and other comprehensive income to noncontrolling interests  and provide other disclosures as required by statement item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange our customers are primarily located in the united states 
on the other hand  many of our suppliers are located outside the united states and  as a result  our financial results could be impacted by foreign currency exchange rates and market conditions abroad 
since a significant portion of our products are imported from china  we continue to monitor the current weakness of the u 
s 
dollar against the strength of the chinese reminibi 
we have not used derivative instruments to hedge our foreign exchange risks though we may choose to do so in the future 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on us during the year ended december  was not material 
interest rates our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates is related primarily to our line of credit 
a portion of the outstanding borrowings on the line of credit bears an interest rate of libor plus a sliding range up to 
a change in the libor rate could have a material effect on interest expense
