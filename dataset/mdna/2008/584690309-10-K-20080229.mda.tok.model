change in fiscal year effective december   we changed our fiscal year end from june to december this change was made to align our fiscal year end with other companies within our industry 
this md a is intended to cover the audited calendar years january  to december   and january  to december   which we refer to as and  respectively 
comparative financial information to is provided in this form k with respect to the calendar year january  to december   which is unaudited and we refer to as executive summary we are a leading independent specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on helping patients attain a healthy and youthful appearance and self image through the development and marketing in the us of products for the treatment of dermatological  aesthetic and podiatric conditions 
we also market products in canada for the treatment of dermatological and aesthetic conditions 
we offer a broad range of products addressing various conditions or aesthetics improvements  including facial wrinkles  acne  fungal infections  rosacea  hyperpigmentation  photoaging  psoriasis  skin and skin structure infections  seborrheic dermatitis and cosmesis improvement in the texture and appearance of skin 
our current product lines are divided between the dermatological and non dermatological fields 
the dermatological field represents products for the treatment of acne and acne related dermatological conditions and non acne dermatological conditions 
the non dermatological field represents products for the treatment of urea cycle disorder and contract revenue 
our acne and acne related dermatological product lines include dynacin  plexion  solodyn  triaz and ziana 
our non acne dermatological product lines include loprox  omnicef  perlane  restylane and vanos 
our non dermatological product lines include ammonul and buphenyl 
our non dermatological field also includes contract revenues associated with licensing agreements and authorized generic agreements 
financial information about segments we operate in one significant business segment pharmaceuticals 
our current pharmaceutical franchises are divided between the dermatological and non dermatological fields 
information on revenues  operating income  identifiable assets and supplemental revenue of our business franchises appears in the consolidated financial statements included in item hereof 
key aspects of our business we derive a majority of our revenue from our primary products perlane  restylane  solodyn  triaz  vanos and ziana 
we believe that sales of our primary products will constitute a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future 

table of contents we have built our business by executing a four part growth strategy promoting existing brands  developing new products and important product line extensions  entering into strategic collaborations and acquiring complementary products  technologies and businesses 
our core philosophy is to cultivate high integrity relationships of trust and confidence with the foremost dermatologists and podiatrists and the leading plastic surgeons in the united states 
we rely on third parties to manufacture our products 
we estimate customer demand for our prescription products primarily through use of third party syndicated data sources which track prescriptions written by health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies 
the data represents extrapolations from information provided only by certain pharmacies and are estimates of historical demand levels 
we estimate customer demand for our non prescription products primarily through internal data that we compile 
we observe trends from these data and  coupled with certain proprietary information  prepare demand forecasts that are the basis for our purchase orders for finished and component inventory from our third party manufacturers and suppliers 
our forecasts may fail to accurately anticipate ultimate customer demand for our products 
overestimates of demand may result in excessive inventory production and underestimates may result in inadequate supply of our products in channels of distribution 
we schedule our inventory purchases to meet anticipated customer demand 
as a result  miscalculation of customer demand or relatively small delays in our receipt of manufactured products could result in revenues being deferred or lost 
our operating expenses are based upon anticipated sales levels  and a high percentage of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
we sell our products primarily to major wholesalers and retail pharmacy chains 
approximately of our gross revenues are typically derived from two major drug wholesale concerns 
depending on the customer  we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to the customer  or at the time of receipt by the customer  net of estimated provisions 
consequently  variations in the timing of revenue recognition could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated periodic earnings shortfalls or losses 
while we attempt to estimate inventory levels of our products at our major wholesale customers by using written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers  historical prescription information and historical purchase patterns  this process is inherently imprecise 
we rely wholly upon our wholesale and drug chain customers to effect the distribution allocation of substantially all of our products 
based upon historically consistent purchasing patterns of our major wholesale customers  we believe our estimates of trade inventory levels of our products are reasonable 
we further believe that inventories of our products among wholesale customers  taken as a whole  are similar to those of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  and that our trade practices  which periodically involve volume discounts and early payment discounts  are typical of the industry 
we periodically offer promotions to wholesale and chain drugstore customers to encourage dispensing of our prescription products  consistent with prescriptions written by licensed health care providers 
because many of our prescription products compete in multi source markets  it is important for us to ensure the licensed health care providers dispensing instructions are fulfilled with our branded products and are not substituted with a generic product or another therapeutic alternative product which may be contrary to the licensed health care providers recommended and prescribed medicis brand 
we believe that a critical component of our brand protection program is maintenance of full product availability at drugstore and wholesale customers 
we believe such availability reduces the probability of local and regional product substitutions  shortages and backorders  which could result in lost sales 
we expect to continue providing favorable terms to wholesale and retail drug chain customers as may be necessary to ensure the fullest possible distribution of our branded products within the pharmaceutical chain of commerce 
we cannot control or significantly influence the purchasing patterns of our wholesale and retail drug chain customers 
they are highly sophisticated customers that purchase products in a manner consistent with their industry practices and  presumably  based upon their projected demand levels 
purchases by any given customer  during any given period  may be above or below actual prescription volumes of any of our products during the same period  resulting in fluctuations of product inventory in the distribution channel 

table of contents as described in more detail below  the following significant events and transactions occurred during  and affected our results of operations  our cash flows and our financial condition fda approval of perlane  write down of intangible asset related to omnicef due to impairment  strategic collaboration with hyperion  and strategic collaboration with revance 
fda approval of perlane on may   the fda approved perlane for implantation into the deep dermis to superficial subcutis for the correction of moderate to severe facial folds and wrinkles  such as nasolabial folds 
in accordance with our agreements with q med  we paid million to q med during the three months ended june  as a result of this milestone 
the million payment is included in intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  the first commercial sales of perlane occurred during may write down of intangible asset related to omnicef due to impairment during the quarter ended june   an intangible asset related to omnicef was determined to be impaired based on our analysis of the intangible asset s carrying value and projected future cash flows

factors affecting the future cash flows of the omnicef intangible asset included an early termination letter received during may from abbott  which  in accordance with our agreement with abbott  transitions our co promotion agreement into a two year residual period  and competitive pressures in the marketplace  including generic competition 
in addition  as a result of the impairment analysis  the remaining amortizable life of the intangible asset related to omnicef was reduced to two years 
the intangible asset related to omnicef will become fully amortized by june  the net impact on amortization expense as a result of the write down of the carrying value of the intangible asset and the reduction of its amortizable life is a decrease in quarterly amortization expense of approximately strategic collaboration with hyperion on august   we  through our wholly owned subsidiary ucyclyd pharma  inc ucyclyd  announced a strategic collaboration with hyperion therapeutics  inc hyperion whereby hyperion will be responsible for the ongoing research and development of a compound referred to as gtp for the treatment of urea cycle disorder  hepatic encephalopathies and other indications  and additional indications for ammonul 
under terms of the collaboration agreement between ucyclyd and hyperion  dated as of august   hyperion made an initial non refundable payment of million to ucyclyd for the rights and licenses granted to hyperion in the agreement 
in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  this million payment was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized on a straight line basis over a period of four years 
in addition  if certain specified conditions are satisfied relating to the ucyclyd development projects  then hyperion will have certain purchase rights with respect to the ucyclyd development products as well as ucyclyd s existing on market products  ammonul and buphenyl  and will pay ucyclyd royalties and regulatory and sales milestone payments in connection with certain licenses that would be granted to hyperion upon exercise of the purchase rights 
additionally  hyperion will be funding all research and development costs for the ucyclyd research projects  and will undertake certain sales and marketing efforts for ucyclyd s existing on market products 
hyperion will receive a commission from ucyclyd equal to a certain percentage of any increase in unit sales 
ucyclyd will continue to record product sales for the existing on market ucyclyd products until such time as hyperion exercises its purchase rights 

table of contents professional fees of approximately million were incurred related to the completion of the agreement with hyperion 
these costs were recognized as general and administrative expenses during the three months ended september  strategic collaboration with revance on december   we announced a strategic collaboration with revance therapeutics  inc revance  a privately held  venture backed development stage company  whereby we made an equity investment in revance and purchased an option to acquire revance or to license exclusively in north america revance s novel topical botulinum toxin type a product currently under clinical development 
the consideration to be paid to revance upon our exercise of the option will be at an amount that will approximate the then fair value of revance or the license of the product under development  as determined by an independent appraisal 
the option period will extend through the end of phase testing in the united states 
in consideration for our million payment  we received preferred stock representing an approximate percent ownership in revance  or approximately percent on a fully diluted basis and the option to acquire revance or to license the product under development 
the million is expected to be used by revance primarily for the development of the new product 
million of the million payment represents the fair value of the investment in revance at the time of the investment and is included in other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  the remaining million  which is non refundable and is expected to be utilized in the development of the new product  represents the residual value of the option to acquire revance or to license the product under development and is included in research and development expense for the three months ended december  additionally  we have committed to make further equity investments in revance of up to million under certain terms and prior to the exercise of the option to acquire revance or to license exclusively revance s topical botulinum toxin type a product in north america 
prior to the exercise of the option  revance will remain primarily responsible for the worldwide development of revance s topical botulinum toxin type a product in consultation with us in north america 
we will assume primary responsibility for the development of the product should consummation of either a merger or a license for topically delivered botulinum toxin type a in north america be completed under the terms of the option 
revance will have sole responsibility for manufacturing the development product and manufacturing the product during commercialization worldwide 
our right to exercise the option is triggered upon revance s successful completion of certain regulatory milestones through the end of phase testing in the united states 
a license would contain a payment upon exercise of the license option  milestone payments related to clinical  regulatory and commercial achievements  and royalties based on sales defined in the license 
if we elect to exercise the option  the financial terms for the acquisition or license will be determined through an independent valuation in accordance with specified methodologies 
professional fees of approximately million were incurred related to the completion of the agreement with revance 
these costs were recognized as general and administrative expenses during the three months ended december  on a going forward basis  in the absence of quantitative valuation metrics  such as a recent financing round  we will estimate the impairment and or the net realizable value of the investment  based on a hypothetical liquidation at book value approach as of the reporting date 
the amount that will be expensed periodically is uncertain due to the timing of expenditures for research and development  and the charges will not be immediately  if ever  deductible for income tax purposes and will increase our effective tax rate 
further equity investments  if any  will also be subject to the same accounting treatment as our original equity investment

in addition  we may consider incurring additional indebtedness and issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or investments  to refinance existing debt or for general corporate purposes 
if a material acquisition or investment is completed  our operating results and financial condition could change materially in future periods 
however  no assurance can be given that additional funds will be available on satisfactory terms  or at all  to fund such activities 
as of december   our short term investments included million of auction rate floating securities 
our auction rate floating securities are debt instruments with a long term maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions 
the recent negative conditions in the credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings  including their holdings of auction rate floating securities 
during february we were informed that there was insufficient demand at auction for approximately million of our auction rate floating securities 
as a result  these affected auction rate floating securities are now not considered liquid  and we could be required to hold them until they are redeemed by the holder at maturity 
the negative credit markets may affect our other auction rate floating securities as they cycle through the auction process 
we may not be able to make the securities liquid until a future auction on these investments is successful 
at this time  we have not obtained sufficient evidence to conclude that the fair value of these auction rate floating securities is less than their carrying value or that they will not be settled in the short term  although the market for these investments is currently uncertain 
all of our auction rate floating securities held as of december  successfully re set at the first auction interval subsequent to december   and we subsequently liquidated approximately million of our auction rate floating securities at par 
as of february   we had approximately million of auction rate floating securities 
during july  we executed a lease agreement for new headquarter office space to accommodate our expected long term growth 
the first phase of this lease is for approximately  square feet with the right to expand 
we expect to occupy the new headquarter office space  which is located approximately one mile from our current headquarter office space in scottsdale  arizona  in the second quarter of there is no financial obligation for lease payments until during october  we executed a lease agreement for additional headquarter office space  which is also located approximately one mile from our current headquarter office space in scottsdale  arizona  to accommodate our current needs and future growth 
under this agreement  approximately  square feet of office space is being leased for a period of three years 
in may  we began occupancy of the additional headquarter office space 
during  we began designing and implementing a new erp system to integrate and improve the financial and operational aspects of our business 
we have dedicated approximately of our employees to various aspects of the project  along with third party consultants 
we expect this project will require an aggregate investment of approximately million during and during  we invested approximately million on this project

the new notes and the old notes are unsecured and do not contain any restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness or the repurchase of our securities  and do not contain any financial covenants 
the old notes do not contain any restrictions on the payment of dividends 
holders of the old notes had the option to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their old notes on june  extended to july  
holders of  of outstanding principal amounts of the old notes exercised their right to require us to purchase their old notes for cash 
the new notes require an adjustment to the conversion price if the cumulative aggregate of all current and prior dividend increases above per share would result in at least a one percent increase in the conversion price 
this threshold has not been reached and no adjustment to the conversion price has been made

if all of the new notes are put back to us on june   we would be required to pay million in outstanding principal  plus outstanding accrued interest 
we would also be required to pay an accumulated deferred tax liability related to the new notes 
the deferred tax liability related to the new notes as of december  was million 
except for the old notes  we had only million of long term liabilities at december  except for the new notes and deferred tax liabilities  we had only million of current liabilities at december  our other commitments and planned expenditures consist principally of payments we will make in connection with strategic collaborations and research and development expenditures  and we will continue to invest in sales and marketing infrastructure 
in addition  we will be continuing our implementation of a new erp system during  which will require financial expenditures to complete 
we have made available to biomarin the ability to draw down on a convertible note up to million beginning july  the convertible note 
the convertible note is convertible based on certain terms and conditions including a change of control provision 
money advanced under the convertible note is convertible into biomarin shares at a strike price equal to the biomarin average closing price for the trading days prior to such advance 
the convertible note matures on the option purchase date in as defined in the securities purchase agreement entered into on may   but may be repaid by biomarin at any time prior to the option purchase date 
as of february   biomarin has not requested any monies to be advanced under the convertible note  and no amounts are outstanding 
repurchases of common stock on august   our board of directors approved a stock trading plan to purchase up to million in aggregate value of shares of our class a common stock upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
the number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of the repurchases if any will depend on factors such as the market price of our class a common stock  economic and market conditions  and corporate and regulatory requirements 
the plan is scheduled to terminate on the earlier of the first anniversary of the plan or at the time when the aggregate purchase limit is reached 
as of february   no shares had been repurchased under this plan 
dividends we do not have a dividend policy 
since july  we have paid quarterly cash dividends aggregating approximately million on our common stock 
in addition  on december   we declared a cash dividend of per issued and outstanding share of common stock payable on january  to our stockholders of record at the close of business on january  prior to these dividends  we had not paid a cash dividend on our common stock 
any future determinations to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition  operating results  capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we are not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes certain other purchase obligations as discussed below in thousands payments due by period more than more than year and years and less than less than less than more than total year years years years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases other purchase obligations and commitments total contractual obligations the long term debt consists of our old notes and new notes

as of december   million of the old notes were classified in the more than years and less than years category as the holders of the old notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their old notes on june   which is more than years but less than years from the december  balance sheet date 
interest on long term debt includes interest payable on our old notes and new notes  assuming the old notes and new notes will not have any redemptions or conversions into shares of our class a common stock until their respective maturities in and  but does not include any contingent interest 
the amount of interest ultimately paid in future years could change if any of the old notes or new notes are converted or redeemed and or if contingent interest becomes payable if certain future criteria are met 
other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under research and development and consulting contracts 
we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of certain product development and license agreements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement and timing of these milestones are not fixed or reasonably determinable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and are not included in the above table 
the total amount of potential future milestone payments related to development and license agreements is approximately million 
purchase orders for raw materials  finished goods and other goods and services are not included in the above table 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purpose of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with relatively short timetables 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or finished goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our short term expected requirements 
we also enter into contracts for 
table of contents outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates related to sales allowances  chargebacks  rebates  returns and other pricing adjustments  depreciation and amortization and other contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors related to each circumstance 
actual results could differ from those estimates based upon future events  which could include  among other risks  changes in the regulations governing the manner in which we sell our products  changes in the health care environment and managed care consumption patterns 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from our product sales is recognized pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
we do not provide any material forms of price protection to our wholesale customers and permit product returns if the product is damaged  or  depending on the customer  if it is returned within six months prior to expiration or up to months after expiration 
our customers consist principally of financially viable wholesalers  and depending on the customer  revenue is recognized based upon shipment fob shipping point or receipt fob destination  net of estimated provisions 
as a general practice  we do not ship product that has less than months until its expiration date 
we also authorize returns for damaged products and credits for expired products in accordance with our returned goods policy and procedures 
the shelf life associated with our products is up to months depending on the product 
the majority of our products have a shelf life of approximately months 
we enter into licensing arrangements with other parties whereby we receive contract revenue based on the terms of the agreement 
the timing of revenue recognition is dependent on the level of our continuing involvement in the manufacture and delivery of licensed products 
if we have continuing involvement  the revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of continuing involvement 
in addition  if our licensing arrangements require no continuing involvement and payments are merely based on the passage of time  we assess such payments for revenue recognition under the collectibility criteria of sab items deducted from gross revenue provisions for estimates for product returns and exchanges  sales discounts  chargebacks  managed care and medicaid rebates and consumer rebate and loyalty programs are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time such revenues are recognized 
these deductions from gross revenue are established by us as our best estimate at the time of sale based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves  including but not limited to  prescription data  industry trends  competitive developments and estimated inventory in the distribution channel 
our estimates of inventory in the distribution channel are based on historical shipment and return information from our accounting records and data on prescriptions filled  which 
table of contents we purchase from ims health  inc  one of the leading providers of prescription based information 
we also utilize projected prescription demand for our products  as well as  written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and our internal information 
these deductions from gross revenue are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance or as an addition to accrued expenses if the payment is due to a party other than the wholesale or retail customer 
currently  we are unable to specify if actual returns or credits relate to a sale that occurred in the current period or prior period  and therefore  we cannot currently specify how much of the provision recorded relates to sales made in prior periods 
however  we believe the data discussed above is appropriate to allow us to reasonably estimate the level of product returns expected from current sales activities  as well as estimate the level of expected credits associated with rebates or chargebacks 
our accounting policies for revenue recognition have a significant impact on our reported results and rely on certain estimates that require complex and subjective judgment on the part of our management 
if the levels of product returns and exchanges  cash discounts  chargebacks  managed care and medicaid rebates and consumer rebate and loyalty programs fluctuate significantly and or if our estimates do not adequately reserve for these reductions of gross product revenues  our reported net product revenues could be negatively affected 
the following table shows the activity of each reserve  associated with the various sales provisions that serve to reduce our accounts receivable balance or increase our accrued expenses  for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands managed consumer care rebate product sales medicaid and returns discounts chargebacks rebates loyalty reserve reserve reserve reserve programs total balance at december  actual provision balance at december  actual provision balance at december  
table of contents product returns we account for returns of product by establishing an allowance based on our estimate of revenues recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned in the future 
we estimate the rate of future product returns for our established products based on our historical experience  the relative risk of return based on expiration date  and other qualitative factors that could impact the level of future product returns  such as competitive developments  product discontinuations and our introduction of similar new products 
historical experience and the other qualitative factors are assessed on a product specific basis as part of our compilation of our estimate of future product returns 
we also estimate inventory in the distribution channel by monitoring inventories held by our distributors  as well as prescription trends to help us assess the rate of return 
we determine our estimates of the sales return accrual for new products primarily based on our historical acceptance of our new product introductions by our customers and product returns experience of similar products  products that have similar characteristics at various stages of their life cycle  and other available information pertinent to the intended use and marketing of the new product 
changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us 
we do not provide material pricing incentives to our distributors that are intended to have them assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business 
our actual experience and the qualitative factors that we use to determine the necessary accrual for future product returns are susceptible to change based on unforeseen events and uncertainties 
we assess the trends that could affect our estimates and make changes to the accrual quarterly when it appears product returns may differ from our original estimates 
the provision for product returns was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for product returns was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision and the reserve was primarily related to a reduction in product returns experienced during and lower levels of inventory in the distribution channel at december  if the forecasted prescription data used to estimate the appropriate amount of inventory in the distribution channel increased by percent  our sales returns reserve at december  would decrease by approximately million and corresponding revenue would increase by the same amount 
conversely  if the forecasted prescription data used to estimate the appropriate amount of inventory in the distribution channel decreased by percent  our sales returns reserve at december  would increase by approximately million and corresponding revenue would decrease by the same amount 
sales discounts we offer cash discounts to our customers as an incentive for prompt payment  generally approximately of the sales price 
we account for cash discounts by establishing an allowance reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts expected to be taken by the customers 
we consider payment performance and adjust the allowance to reflect actual experience and our current expectations about future activity 
the provision for cash discounts was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for cash discounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision was due to an increase in gross product sales 
the balance in the reserve for sales discounts at the end of the fiscal year is related to the amount of accounts receivable that is outstanding at that date that is still eligible for the cash discounts to be taken by the customers 
the fluctuations in the reserve for sales discounts between periods is normally reflective of increases or decreases in the related eligible outstanding accounts receivable amounts at the comparable dates 
as our customer base is made up primarily of major wholesalers and retail chains  cash discounts have historically become earned by our customers 
therefore  we record a provision and maintain a reserve for the maximum amount of potential cash discounts 
if there was a percent decrease in the number of customers that 
table of contents earned a cash discount during  the provision for would have been reduced by approximately million and the reserve at december  would have been reduced by approximately million 
contract chargebacks we have agreements for contract pricing with several entities  whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price 
these parties purchase products through wholesalers at the lower contract price  and the wholesalers charge the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contract price back to us 
we account for chargebacks by establishing an allowance reducing accounts receivable based on our estimate of chargeback claims attributable to a sale 
we determine our estimate of chargebacks based on historical experience and changes to current contract prices 
we also consider our claim processing lag time  and adjust the allowance periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience 
although we record an allowance for estimated chargebacks at the time we record the sale typically when we ship the product  the actual chargeback related to that sale is not processed until the entities purchase the product from the wholesaler 
we continually monitor our historical experience and current pricing trends to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated 
the provision for contract chargebacks was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for contract chargebacks was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision and the reserve was due to a decrease in the number of pricing contracts in place during the comparable periods 
if our estimate for contract chargeback claim activity changed by percent our reserve for contract chargebacks would be impacted by approximately million and corresponding revenue would be impacted by the same amount 
managed care and medicaid rebates rebates are contractual discounts offered to government programs and private health plans that are eligible for such discounts at the time prescriptions are dispensed  subject to various conditions 
we record provisions for rebates by estimating these liabilities as products are sold  based on factors such as timing and terms of plans under contract  time to process rebates  product pricing  sales volumes  amount of inventory in the distribution channel  and prescription trends 
we continually monitor historical payment rates and actual claim data to ensure the liability is fairly stated 
the provision for managed care and medicaid rebates was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for managed care and medicaid rebates was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of medicaid rebates related to loprox  due to decreasing demand and fewer rebate transactions 
the decrease in the reserve is due to a decrease in the amount of rebates outstanding at the comparable dates 
if the forecasted prescription data used to estimate the appropriate amount of inventory in the distribution channel changed by percent or our historical percentage of sales that generated a rebate were to change by percent our reserve for managed care and medicaid rebates would be impacted by approximately million and corresponding revenue would be impacted by the same amount 
consumer rebates and loyalty programs we offer consumer rebates on many of our products and we have consumer loyalty programs 
we generally account for these programs by establishing an accrual based on our estimate of the rebate and loyalty incentives attributable to a sale 
we generally base our estimates for the accrual of these items on historical experience and other relevant factors 
we adjust our accruals periodically throughout each quarter based on actual experience and changes in other factors  if any  to ensure the balance is fairly stated 

table of contents the provision for consumer rebates and loyalty programs was million  or of gross product sales  and million  or of gross product sales  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reserve for consumer rebates and loyalty programs was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision and the reserve was primarily due to new consumer rebate programs initiated during related to our solodyn and ziana products and increased sales of restylane and participation in the restylane customer loyalty program 
if our estimates of rebate redemption rates and average rebate amounts for our consumer rebate programs changed by percent  and our estimates of eligible procedures completed related to our customer loyalty programs were to change by percent  our reserve for these items would be impacted by approximately million and corresponding revenue would be impacted by the same amount 
use of information from external sources we use information from external sources to estimate our significant items deducted from gross revenues 
our estimates of inventory in the distribution channel are based on historical shipment and return information from our accounting records and data on prescriptions filled  which we purchase from ims health  inc  one of the leading providers of prescription based information 
we also utilize projected prescription demand for our products  as well as  written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and our internal information 
we use the information from ims health  inc to project the prescription demand for our products 
our estimates are subject to inherent limitations pertaining to reliance on third party information  as certain third party information is itself in the form of estimates 
use of estimates in reserves we believe that our allowances and accruals for items that are deducted from gross revenues are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
it is possible  however  that other parties applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different allowance and accrual amounts for items that are deducted from gross revenues 
additionally  changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause our allowances and accruals to fluctuate  particularly with newly launched products 
we review the rates and amounts in our allowance and accrual estimates on a quarterly basis 
if future estimated rates and amounts are significantly greater than those reflected in our recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would decrease our reported net revenues  conversely  if actual returns  rebates and chargebacks are significantly less than those reflected in our recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would increase our reported net revenues 
if we changed our assumptions and estimates  our related reserves would change  which would impact the net revenues we report 
during the three months ended december   we experienced a decline in demand for certain of our products  primarily vanos 
as a result  we increased the sales returns reserves by approximately million during the three months ended december  specifically related to vanos 
the effect of this change on the net loss for was to increase the net loss by approximately million or per common share 

table of contents share based compensation as part of our adoption of sfas no 
r as of july   we were required to recognize the fair value of share based compensation awards as an expense 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility 
increasing the weighted average volatility by percent from percent to percent would have increased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share 
conversely  decreasing the weighted average volatility by percent from percent to percent would have decreased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share 
the expected life of the awards is based on historical experience of awards with similar characteristics 
stock option awards granted during have a stated term of years  and the weighted average expected life of the awards was determined to be years 
decreasing the weighted average expected life by years from years to years would have decreased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts 
the fair value of our restricted stock grants is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant discounted for expected future dividends 
sfas no 
r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate may have a significant effect on share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after july  is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the first quarter of was immaterial 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what was recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 
our estimates of these important assumptions are based on historical data and judgment regarding market trends and factors 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors  we may be required to record additional stock based compensation expense or income tax expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
inventory inventory costs associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval are capitalized if we believe there is probable future commercial use and future economic benefit 
if future commercial use and future economic benefit are not considered probable  then costs associated with pre launch inventory that has not yet received regulatory approval are expensed as research and development expense during the period the costs are incurred 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory if the probability of future commercial use and future economic benefit changes due to denial or delay of regulatory approval  a delay in commercialization  or other factors 
conversely  our gross margins could be favorably impacted if previously expensed pre approval inventory becomes available and is used for commercial sale 
as of 
table of contents december   there no costs capitalized into inventory for products that have not yet received regulatory approval 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset carrying value is not recoverable through the related cash flows  the asset is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset grouping s carrying amount and its fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated  and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets  we accelerate the rate of amortization charges in order to fully amortize the assets over their new shorter useful lives 
during  and  impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  were recognized related to our review of long lived assets 
during  the remaining useful life of the intangible asset that was deemed to be impaired was reduced 
during  the remaining useful lives of two of the intangible assets that were deemed to be impaired were reduced 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for  and or accelerate amortization of  long lived assets 
income taxes income taxes are determined using an annual effective tax rate  which generally differs from the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of state and local income taxes  enhanced charitable contribution deductions for inventory  tax credits available in the us  the treatment of certain share based payments under sfas r that are not designed to normally result in tax deductions  various expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  and differences in tax rates in certain non us jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the year as new information is obtained which may affect the assumptions we use to estimate our annual effective tax rate  including factors such as our mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  changes in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  reserves for tax audit issues and settlements  utilization of tax credits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct operations 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities  along with net operating losses and credit carryforwards 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying values to amounts that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
based on our historical pre tax earnings  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the existing net deferred tax assets at december  we believe the existing net deductible temporary differences will reverse during periods in which we generate net taxable income  however  there can be no assurance that we will generate any earnings or any specific level of continuing earnings in future years 
certain tax planning or other strategies could be implemented  if necessary  to supplement income from operations to fully realize recorded tax benefits 
research and development costs and accounting for strategic collaborations all research and development costs  including payments related to products under development and research consulting agreements  are expensed as incurred 
we may continue to make non refundable payments to third parties for new technologies and for new technologies and research and development work that has been completed 
these payments may be expensed at the time of payment depending on the nature of the payment made 

table of contents our policy on accounting for costs of strategic collaborations determines the timing of our recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or capitalized as an asset 
we are required to form judgments with respect to the commercial status of such products in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
for example  when we acquire certain products for which there is already an anda or nda approval related directly to the product  and there is net realizable value based on projected sales for these products  we capitalize the amount paid as an intangible asset 
in addition  if we acquire product rights which are in the development phase and as to which we have no assurance that the third party will successfully complete its development milestones  we expense such payments 
legal contingencies we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose material contingent liabilities  when there is a reasonable possibility  that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
as of december   we accrued a loss contingency of million related our settlement of all outstanding federal and state civil suits against the company in connection with claims related to our alleged off label marketing and promotion of loprox and loprox ts products to pediatricians during periods prior to our may disposition of our pediatric sales division 
this loss contingency is included in other current liabilities as of december  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  and is included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
this loss contingency of million was paid during in addition to the matters disclosed in item legal proceedings  we are party to ordinary and routine litigation incidental to our business 
we do not expect the outcome of any pending litigation  other than those specified in item legal proceedings  to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk at december   million of our cash equivalent investments are in money market securities that are reflected as cash equivalents  because all maturities are within days 
included in money market securities are commercial paper  federal agency discount notes and money market funds 
our interest rate risk with respect to these investments is limited due to the short term duration of these arrangements and the yields earned  which approximate current interest rates 
our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities that we hold on an available for sale basis  was approximately million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase 
as of december   our short term investments included million of auction rate floating securities 
our auction rate floating securities are debt instruments with a long term maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions 
the recent negative conditions in the credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings  including their holdings of auction rate floating securities 
during february we were informed that there was insufficient demand at auction for approximately million of our auction rate floating securities 
as a result  these affected auction rate floating securities are now not considered liquid  and we could be required to hold them until they are redeemed by the holder at maturity 
the negative credit markets may affect our other auction rate floating securities as they cycle through the auction process 
we may not be able to make the securities liquid until a future auction on these investments is successful 
at this time  we have not obtained sufficient evidence to conclude that the fair value of these auction rate floating securities is less than their carrying value or that they will not be settled in the short term  although the market for these investments is currently uncertain 
all of our auction rate floating securities held as of december  successfully re set at auction at the first auction interval subsequent to december   and we subsequently liquidated approximately million of our auction rate floating securities at par 
as of february   we had approximately million of auction rate floating securities 
the following table provides information about our available for sale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we have aggregated our available for sale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollar amounts in thousands interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity as of december  financial instruments mature during year ended december  thereafter available for sale securities weighted average yield rate contingent convertible senior notes due interest rate contingent convertible senior notes due interest rate changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our contingent convertible senior notes as the interest rates are fixed 
we have not entered into derivative financial instruments 
we have minimal operations outside of the united states and  accordingly  we have not been susceptible to significant risk from changes in foreign currencies 

table of contents during the normal course of business we could be subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discussed above  and collectibility of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
