item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general park is a global advanced materials company which develops  manufactures and markets high technology digital and rf microwave printed circuit materials principally for the telecommunications and internet infrastructure and high end computing markets and advanced composite materials  structures and components principally for the aerospace markets 
the company s manufacturing facilities are located in singapore  china  france  connecticut  new york  arizona  california and washington 
the company s products are marketed and sold under the nelco r  nelcote r and nova tm names 
the global electronics manufacturing industry  which had become extremely and unsustainably overheated in the s and into calendar year  collapsed in calendar year  and has not recovered since that collapse 
the company believes that the industry has become a mature industry  and the company does not expect significant non cyclical  sustainable growth from that industry in the future 
the comparisons of the company s results of operations for its fiscal year ended march  to the company s results of operations for its fiscal year ended february  are impacted by the facts that the fiscal year consisted of weeks and the fiscal year consisted of weeks 
the company s net sales declined in the fiscal year ended march  compared with the fiscal year ended february  as a result of decreases in sales of the company s printed circuit materials in north america and europe  and  consequently  the company s earnings from operations and net earnings were lower in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year 
the company s net earnings for the fiscal year ended march  were increased by a tax benefit of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year fourth quarter relating to a reduction of tax reserves in the united states related to transfer pricing and were reduced by a charge of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year fourth quarter for employment termination benefits and other expenses related to a restructuring and workforce reduction at the company s neltec europe sas electronic materials business unit located in mirebeau  france 
the company s net earnings for the fiscal year ended february  were increased by a tax benefit of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year fourth quarter relating to the recognition of tax credits resulting from operating losses sustained in prior years in france and by tax benefits recognized by the company in the fiscal year second quarter of million relating to the elimination of certain valuation allowances previously established relating to deferred tax assets in the united states  million relating to the elimination of reserves no longer required as the result of the completion of a tax audit and million relating to the termination of a life insurance arrangement with jerry shore  the company s founder and former chairman  president and chief executive officer  and such net earnings were reduced by a pre tax charge of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year second quarter relating to the termination of such insurance arrangement 
the decline in the company s operating performance during the fiscal year was attributable principally to decreases in total sales of the company s printed circuit materials products  which were only partially offset by higher percentages of sales of higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials products and by a higher percentage of sales by the company s operations in singapore 
the company believes that the markets for its printed circuit materials products have contracted from the levels that existed in the fiscal year 
consequently  sales of the company s printed circuit materials products decreased in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year 
the markets for the company s advanced composite materials products continued to be relatively strong during the fiscal year  and sales of the company s advanced composite materials products increased in the fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials products continue to be very difficult to forecast  and it is not clear to the company what the condition of the global markets for the company s printed circuit materials products will be in the fiscal year 
the company believes that the markets for its advanced composite materials products will continue to be strong during the fiscal year 
in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year  the company s new wholly owned subsidiary  park aerospace structures corp  acquired substantially all the assets and business of nova composites  inc  a designer and manufacturer of aircraft composite structures and components and the tooling for such structures and components  located in lynnwood  washington  for a cash purchase price of million paid at the closing of the acquisition and up to an additional million payable over five years depending on the achievement of specified earn out objectives 
in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  the company opened its new advanced composite materials manufacturing plant in singapore  which it had acquired in the fiscal year and modified and expanded for use as a composite materials manufacturing plant 
in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  the company also commenced the construction of a new development and manufacturing facility in newton  kansas to produce advanced composite materials principally for the general aviation aircraft segment of the aerospace industry 
as previously announced  the company plans to spend approximately million on the facility and equipment in kansas 
as previously reported  the company discontinued its participation in the bidding for certain of the assets and business of columbia aircraft manufacturing corporation columbia in an auction conducted in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of oregon in portland  oregon on november  and incurred approximately million in out of pocket expenses relating to its extensive due diligence investigation of columbia in bend  oregon and elsewhere  all of which was expensed in the fiscal year third quarter ended november  in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  the company also recorded a tax benefit of million relating to the reduction of tax reserves 
in the first quarter of the fiscal year  the company completed the construction of a new manufacturing facility in the zhuhai free trade zone in guangdong province in southern china 
the company is in the process of modifying certain of the equipment in this facility so that it can laminate ptfe based circuitry materials in asia 
in addition  the company upgraded its printed circuit materials treating operation in singapore during the fiscal year third quarter so that such operation is capable of treating the company s full line of advanced printed circuit materials in singapore  except polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe materials 
in addition  during the fiscal year  the company completed the installation of an additional large treater at its advanced composite materials facility in waterbury  connecticut  which has significantly increased the treating capacity of that facility 
while the company continues to expand and invest in its business  it also continues to make additional adjustments to certain of its operations  which resulted in workforce reductions 
in the fiscal year fourth quarter  the company s electronic materials business unit located in mirebeau  france  neltec europe sas  completed a restructuring of its operations and a reduction of its workforce in response to the continuing erosion of the markets for electronic materials in europe and the continuing migration of such markets to asia  and the company recorded a one time charge of approximately million in such quarter for employment termination benefits and other expenses resulting from such restructuring and workforce reduction 
in addition  in the fiscal year first and second quarters  the company reduced the size of the workforce at its neltec europe sas business unit as a result of deterioration of the european market for high technology printed circuit materials  and it recorded an employment termination benefits charge of million during the fiscal year first quarter  million of which was reversed in the fiscal year fourth quarter 
during the fiscal year s second quarter  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in connection with the termination of an insurance arrangement with jerry shore  the company s founder and former chairman  president and chief executive officer  and recognized a million tax benefit relating to this insurance termination charge 
the termination of the insurance arrangement involved a payment of million by the company to mr 
shore in january  which resulted in a net cash cost to the company of million  after the company s receipt of a portion of the cash surrender value of the insurance policies 
during the fiscal year s second quarter  the company also recognized a tax benefit of million relating to the elimination of certain valuation allowances previously established relating to deferred tax assets in the united states and a tax benefit of million relating to the elimination of reserves no longer required as the result of the completion of a tax audit

the company s financial results of operations in the fiscal year were slightly enhanced by a tax benefit of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year fourth quarter resulting from the reduction of tax reserves  which was partially offset by a charge of million recorded by the company in the fiscal year fourth quarter for employment termination benefits and other expenses resulting from a restructuring and workforce reduction at the company s neltec europe sas electronic materials business unit located in mirebeau  france 
the company s financial results of operations in the fiscal year were enhanced by the tax benefit of million recorded by the company for the recognition of tax credits resulting from operating losses sustained in prior years in france and by the tax benefits of million relating to the elimination of certain valuation allowances previously established related to deferred tax assets in the united states  million relating to the elimination of reserves no longer required as the result of the completion of a tax audit and million relating to the termination of a life insurance agreement with jerry shore  the company s founder and former chairman  president and chief executive officer  which benefits were partially offset by a pre tax charge of million relating to the termination of the insurance agreement with jerry shore 
results of operations the company s total net sales worldwide for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to million from million for the fiscal year ended february  the decrease in net sales was the result of decreased sales by the company s operations in north america and europe  which were only partially offset by increased sales by the company s operations in asia and by increased sales of the company s high technology printed circuit materials and advanced composite materials 
the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total net sales worldwide  during the fiscal year  compared with million of sales  or of total net sales worldwide during the fiscal year and of total net sales worldwide during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased from the fiscal year primarily as a result of increases in sales by the company s operations in asia 
for the fiscal year ended march   the company s sales in north america  asia and europe were  and  respectively  of the company s total net sales worldwide compared with  and for the fiscal year ended february  the company s sales in asia increased in the fiscal year over the fiscal year  while its sales in north america decreased and its sales in europe decreased in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year 
the overall gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the company s worldwide operations improved to during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
the improvement in the gross profit margin was attributable to higher percentages of sales of higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials and a higher percentage of sales by the company s operations in singapore  partially offset by higher copper foil costs in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year and by lower total sales volumes in the fiscal year 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company s total net sales worldwide of high temperature printed circuit materials  which included high performance materials non fr printed circuit materials  were of the company s total net sales worldwide of printed circuit materials  compared with for last fiscal year 
the company s high temperature printed circuit materials include its high performance materials non fr printed circuit materials  which consist of high speed  low loss materials for digital and rf microwave applications requiring lead free compatibility and high bandwidth signal integrity  bismalimide triazine bt materials  polyimides for applications that demand extremely high thermal performance  cyanate esters  and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe materials for rf microwave systems that operate at frequencies up to ghz

the company s cost of sales declined by in the fiscal year from the fiscal year as a result of lower sales and lower production volumes in the fiscal year than in the fiscal year 
the company s cost of sales as a percentage of net sales also decreased slightly in the fiscal year compared to the prior year resulting in a slight gross profit percentage improvement  which was attributable to higher percentages of sales of higher margin  high performance printed circuit materials and a higher percentage of sales by the company s operations in singapore 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or by  during the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year  and these expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
such expenses were higher in the fiscal year primarily as a result of the out of pocket expenses incurred by the company related to its due diligence investigation of columbia aircraft manufacturing corporation discussed below and the additional week in the week fiscal year compared to the week fiscal year 
the higher percentage in the fiscal year was the result of lower sales in such year and the aforementioned out of pocket expenses
