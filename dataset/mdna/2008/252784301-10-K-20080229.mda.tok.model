item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in forward looking statements and risk factors contained in our sec filings 
overview we are a lodging focused real estate company that owns  as of february   twenty premium hotels and resorts that contain approximately  guestrooms 
we are committed to maximizing shareholder value through investing in premium full service hotels and  to a lesser extent  premium urban limited service hotels located throughout the united states 
our hotels are concentrated in key gateway cities and in destination resort locations and are all operated under a brand owned by one of the top three national brand companies marriott  starwood or hilton 
we are owners  as opposed to operators  of hotels 
as an owner  we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels  after we pay the hotel managers a fee based on the revenues and profitability of the hotels and reimburse all of their direct and indirect operating costs 
as an owner  we create value by acquiring the right hotels with the right brands in the right markets  prudently financing our hotels  thoughtfully re investing capital in our hotels  implementing profitable operating strategies and approving the annual operating and capital budgets for our hotels  closely monitoring the performance of our hotels  and deciding if and when to sell our hotels 
in addition  we are committed to enhancing the value of our operating platform by being open and transparent in our communications with investors  monitoring our corporate overhead and following corporate governance best practice 
we differentiate ourselves from our competitors because of our adherence to three basic principles high quality urban and resort focused real estate  conservative capital structure  and thoughtful asset management 
high quality and resort focused real estate we own twenty premium hotels and resorts in north america 
these hotels and resorts are all categorized as upper upscale as defined by smith travel research and are generally located in high barrier to entry markets with multiple demand generators 
our properties are concentrated in five key gateway cities new york city  los angeles  chicago  boston and atlanta and in destination resorts such as the us virgin islands and vail  colorado 
we believe that these gateway cities and destination resorts are high growth markets because they are attractive business and leisure destinations 
we also believe that these locations are better insulated from new supply due to relatively high barriers to entry and expensive construction costs 
we believe that the higher quality lodging assets create more dynamic cash flow growth and superior long term capital appreciation 
conservative capital structure we are committed to maintaining a conservative and flexible capital structure with prudent leverage levels 
during through early  we took advantage of the low interest environment by fixing our debt rates for an extended period of time 
depending on the outlook for interest rates in the future we maintain the flexibility to modify these strategies 
as of december   of our debt carried fixed interest rates  with a weighted average interest rate of  and a weighted average maturity date of years 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding  representing a net debt to enterprise value ratio of  which is calculated as our net debt debt less unrestricted cash divided by our enterprise value  which is our market capitalization plus net debt 
we prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure 
we have not invested in joint ventures and have not issued any operating partnership units or preferred stock 
we endeavor to structure our hotel acquisitions so that they will not overly complicate our capital structure  however  we will consider a more complex transaction if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available 
thoughtful asset management we believe that we are able to create significant value in our portfolio by utilizing our management s extensive experience and our innovative asset management strategies 
our senior management team has established a broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships  including relationships with hotel owners  financiers  operators  project managers and contractors and other key industry participants 
we use our broad network to maximize the value of our hotels 
under the regulations governing reits  we are required to engage a hotel manager through one of our subsidiaries to manage each of our hotels pursuant to a management agreement 
our philosophy is to negotiate management agreements that give us the right to exert significant influence over the management of our properties  annual budgets and all capital expenditures  and then to use those rights to continually monitor and improve the performance of our properties 
we cooperatively partner with the managers of our hotels in an attempt to increase operating results and long term asset values at our hotels 
in addition to working directly with the personnel at our hotels  our senior management team also has long standing professional relationships with our hotel managers senior executives and we work directly with these senior executives to improve the performance of our portfolio 
we believe we can create significant value in our portfolio through innovative asset management strategies such as rebranding  renovating and repositioning 
we are committed to regularly evaluating our portfolio to determine if we can employ these value added strategies at our hotels 
during and  we completed a significant amount of capital reinvestment in our hotels completing projects that ranged from a room renovation courtyard manhattan midtown east  los angeles airport marriott  bethesda marriott suites  orlando airport marriott  frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort  and westin atlanta north at perimeter to a total renovation and repositioning of the hotel torrance marriott south bay and the oak brook hills marriott resort to the addition of new meeting space  spa or restaurant reposition westin boston waterfront  chicago marriot and marriott griffin gate resort 
by the end of  we expect to have fully renovated nearly all of the hotels in our portfolio 
in connection with our planned renovations and repositionings  our senior management team and our asset managers are individually committed to completing these renovations on time  on budget and with minimum disruption at our hotels 
a core tenet of our asset management strategy is to leverage national hotel brands 
we strongly believe in the value of powerful national brands because we believe that they are able to produce incremental revenue and profits compared to similar unbranded hotels 
dominant national hotel brands typically have very strong reservation and reward systems and sales organizations  as a result  all of our hotels are operated under a brand owned by one of the top three national brand companies marriott  starwood or hilton and all but two of the hotels are operated by the brand company directly 
generally  we are interested in acquiring only those hotels that are operated under a nationally recognized brand or can be converted into a branded hotel 
key indicators of financial condition and operating performance we use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business 
these key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with gaap  as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  we use other information that may not be financial in nature  including statistical information and comparative data 
we use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels  groups of hotels and or our business as a whole 
we periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry wide information 
these key indicators include occupancy percentage  average daily rate or adr  revenue per available room or revpar  earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization or ebitda  and funds from operations or ffo 
occupancy  adr and revpar are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance 
revpar  which is calculated as the product of adr and occupancy percentage  is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole 
we evaluate individual hotel revpar performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods  as well as on a company wide and regional basis 
adr and revpar include only room revenue 
room revenue comprised approximately and of our total revenues for each of the years ended december  and  respectively  and is dictated by demand  as measured by occupancy percentage  pricing  as measured by adr  and our available supply of hotel rooms 
our adr  occupancy percentage and revpar performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as regional and local employment growth  personal income and corporate earnings  office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions  airport and other business and leisure travel  new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of competitors 
in addition  our adr  occupancy percentage and revpar performance is dependent on the continued success of our hotel managers and the brands we have licensed 
we also use ebitda and ffo as measures of the financial performance of our business

our hotels as of december   we owned the following hotels property location number of rooms chicago marriott chicago  illinois  los angeles airport marriott los angeles  california  westin boston waterfront hotel boston  massachusetts renaissance waverly atlanta  georgia salt lake city marriott downtown salt lake city  utah renaissance worthington fort worth  texas frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort st

on january   we acquired a leasehold interest in the westin boston waterfront hotel 
in addition to the boston waterfront hotel  the acquisition  which closed on february   included a leasehold interest in  square feet of retail space  and an option to acquire a leasehold interest in a parcel of land with development rights to build a to room hotel 
the contractual purchase price for the westin boston waterfront hotel  the leasehold interest in the retail space and the option to acquire a leasehold interest in a parcel of land was million 
the westin boston waterfront hotel opened in june and contains rooms and  square feet of meeting space 
follow on offering 
we completed a follow on offering of our common stock on january  we sold  shares of common stock  including the underwriters over allotment of  shares  at an offering price of per share 
the net proceeds to us  after deduction of offering costs  were million 
the company used the net proceeds of this offering to complete the acquisition of the westin boston waterfront hotel 
dividends 
we declared the following dividends on common shares during the year ended december  payment date record date dividend per share april  march  june  june  september  september  january  december  refinancing of mortgage debt 
on july   we repaid the million fixed rate mortgage debt on the bethesda marriott suites and replaced it with a million variable rate mortgage 
in connection with this transaction  we recognized a gain on the early extinguishment of million  which is comprised of the write off of the related debt premium of million offset by a prepayment penalty of million and the write off of deferred financing costs of million 
the new million mortgage loan has a three year term and bears a floating rate of interest based on libor plus basis points 
the new mortgage loan can be repaid at any time during the three year term with no prepayment penalty 
disposition of springhill suites atlanta buckhead 
on december   the company sold the springhill suites atlanta buckhead for approximately million  resulting in a gain of approximately million  net of million of income taxes 
outlook for we believe that the economic drivers that impact underlying lodging fundamentals  such as growth in gdp  business investment and employment  are likely to weaken in the expected decline in these drivers will likely result in a significantly lower revenue growth rate for our hotels than was experienced in and while demand growth could moderate as a result of slowing economic drivers  projections for new supply in the markets in which we own hotels suggest that supply growth will also be constrained 
we believe the slower economic growth in will likely result in lower transient demand  primarily from the corporate and leisure segments 
overall  we expect group demand to be similar to the levels achieved in we anticipate our revpar will increase approximately to over however  improvements in operating results will be constrained by increasing operating costs as well as certain costs increasing at a rate greater than inflation  including wages  benefits  utilities and real estate taxes 
we anticipate that despite the recent tightening of the domestic credit markets investment opportunities for asset acquisitions will continue to be limited 
liquidity concerns should moderate the increases in valuations that have occurred in recent years and limit the number of buyers who utilize higher levels of leverage 
consequently  owners will not likely be willing to sell their hotels at lower price levels initially  which in the near term  will reduce the number of domestic properties available that will meet our return on investment requirements

we recorded an income tax benefit from continuing operations for income taxes of million for the year ended december  we recorded an income statement charge of million in the first quarter to reverse a portion of the deferred tax assets recorded in in connections with our reit election 
this charge was offset by an income tax benefit of million recorded on the million pre tax loss of our trs for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to fund future distributions to our stockholders to maintain our reit status as well as to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our hotels  including capital expenditures as well as payments of interest and principal 
we currently expect that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations  existing cash balances and  if necessary  short term borrowings under our credit facility 
our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional hotels  renovations  expansions and other capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our hotels  scheduled debt payments and making distributions to our stockholders 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  cash provided by operations and borrowings  as well as through the issuances of additional equity or debt securities 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including the current state of the overall credit markets  our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
our ability to raise funds through the issuance of debt and equity securities is dependent upon  among other things  general market conditions for reits and market perceptions about us 
our financing strategy we are committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure with aggregate leverage weighted towards long term fixed rate debt 
however  we maintain the flexibility to modify these strategies if we believe fundamental changes have occurred in the capital or lodging markets 
as of december   of our debt carried fixed interest rates  with a weighted average interest rate of  and a weighted average maturity date of years 
moreover  as of december   we had million of debt outstanding  representing a debt to enterprise value ratio of  which is calculated as our net debt debt less unrestricted cash divided by our enterprise value  which is our market capitalization plus net debt 
we have a strong bias for fixed rate long term limited recourse single property specific debt and when possible and desirable  we will seek to replace short term sources of capital with long term financing 
in addition to property specific debt and our credit facility  we intend to use other financing methods as necessary  including obtaining from banks  institutional investors or other lenders  bridge loans  letters of credit  and other arrangements  any of which may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in our investments 
in addition  we may issue publicly or privately placed debt instruments 
we prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure 
we have not invested in joint ventures and have not issued any operating partnership units or preferred stock 
we endeavor to structure our hotel acquisitions so that they will not overly complicate our capital structure  however  we will consider a more complex transaction if we believe that the projected returns to our shareholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available 
share repurchase program on february   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
the common stock may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions  dependent upon market conditions 
the plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion 
we have approximately million shares outstanding as of february  credit facility on february   we amended our existing credit facility and entered into a four year  million unsecured credit facility the facility 
we may extend the maturity date of the facility for an additional year upon the payment of applicable fees and the satisfaction of certain other customary conditions 
we may also increase the amount of the facility to million with the lenders approval 
interest is paid on the periodic advances under the facility at varying rates  based upon either libor or the alternate base rate  plus an agreed upon additional margin amount

non gaap financial measures we use the following two non gaap financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key measures of our operating performance ebitda and ffo 
these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with gaap 
ebitda represents net income loss excluding interest expense  provision for income taxes  including income taxes applicable to sale of assets  and depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
in addition  covenants included in our indebtedness use ebitda as a measure of financial compliance 
we also use ebitda as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions 
year ended december  december  december  in thousands net income loss    interest expense    income tax expense benefit    real estate related depreciation and amortization  ebitda    amounts for the years ended december    and include million  million and million  respectively  of income tax benefit included in discontinued operations 
amounts for the years ended december    and include million  million and million  respectively  of depreciation expense included in discontinued operations 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which defines ffo as net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures which are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we believe that the presentation of ffo provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations without regard to specified non cash items  such as real estate depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on sale of assets 
we also use ffo as one measure in determining our results after taking into account the impact of our capital structure 
year ended december  december  december  in thousands net income loss    real estate related depreciation and amortization  gain on property transaction  net of taxes  ffo    amounts for the years ended december    and include million  million and million  respectively  of depreciation expense included in discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the diamondrock hospitality company and all consolidated subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates investment in hotels 
acquired hotels  land improvements  building and furniture  fixtures and equipment and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
additions to property and equipment  including current buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for buildings and land improvements and one to ten years for furniture and equipment 
identifiable intangible assets are typically related to contracts  including ground lease agreements and hotel management agreements  which are recorded at fair value 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair market contract rates for corresponding contracts 
contracts acquired that are at market do not have significant value 
we typically enter into a new hotel management agreement based on market terms at the time of acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data 
management also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we review our investments in hotels for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments in hotels may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause us to perform a review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located 
when such conditions exist  management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of an investment in a hotel exceed the hotel s carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss recognized 
revenue recognition 
hotel revenues  including room  golf  food and beverage  and other hotel revenues  are recognized as the related services are provided 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based employee compensation using the fair value based method of accounting described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment 
the company records the cost of awards with service conditions based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
no awards with performance based or market based conditions have been issued 
accounting for key money 
marriott has contributed to us certain amounts  which we refer to as key money  in exchange for the right to manage certain of our hotels 
we defer key money received from a hotel manager in conjunction with entering into a long term hotel management agreement or completing certain brand enhancing capital projects and amortize the amount received against management fees over the term of the management agreement 
accounting for yield support 
marriott has provided us with operating cash flow guarantees for certain hotels will fund shortfalls of actual hotel operating income  which is net of management fees  compared to a negotiated target net operating income 
we refer to these guarantees as yield support 
yield support received is recognized over the period earned if the yield support is not refundable and there is reasonable uncertainty of receipt at inception of the management agreement 
yield support is recorded as an offset to base management fees 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates 
seasonality the operations of hotels historically have been seasonal depending on location  and accordingly  we expect some seasonality in our business 
historically  we have experienced approximately two thirds of our annual income in the second and fourth quarters 
new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
on february   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the standard s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
we have elected not to report these selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  significantly changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas r  which includes the expensing of transaction costs incurred to acquire assets 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas  changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we currently do not have any minority interests and  as such  do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and risk factors quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
in pursuing our business strategies  the primary market risk to which we are currently exposed  and  which we expect to be exposed in the future  is interest rate risk 
the face amount of our outstanding debt at december  was approximately million  of which million or was variable rate debt 
as of december   the fair value of the million of fixed rate debt was approximately million 
if market rates of interest were to increase by  or approximately basis points  the decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate debt would be million 
on the other hand  if market rates of interest were to decrease by one percentage point  or approximately basis points  the increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt would be million
