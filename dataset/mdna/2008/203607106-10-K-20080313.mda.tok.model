the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information on page and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear on pages through all references in the discussion to the financial condition and results of operations are to the consolidated position and results of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole 
unless otherwise noted  all earnings per share eps figures disclosed in the md a refer to diluted eps  interest income  net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully tax equivalent fte basis 
the term this year and equivalent terms refer to results in calendar year  last year and equivalent terms refer to calendar year  and all references to income statement results correspond to full year activity unless otherwise noted 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of community bank system  inc these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements are set herein under the caption forward looking statements on page critical accounting policies as a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the company s business  management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations 
the policy decision process not only ensures compliance with the latest generally accepted accounting principles gaap  but also reflects on management s discretion with regard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the company s financial performance 
it is management s opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance  or the level of subjectivity in the selection process 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the critical accounting estimates include allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable loan losses in the company s loan portfolio 
determination of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective 
it requires significant estimates including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and the amount of estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans which is based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
actuarial assumptions associated with pension  post retirement and other employee benefit plans these assumptions include discount rate  rate of future compensation increases and expected return on plan assets 
specific discussion of the assumptions used by management is discussed in note k on pages through provision for income taxes the company is subject to examinations from various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions 
management believes that the assumptions and judgments used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate 
should tax laws change or the taxing authorities determine that management s assumptions were inappropriate  an adjustment may be required which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets is based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific risk indicators 
a summary of the accounting policies used by management is disclosed in note a  summary of significant accounting policies  starting on page executive summary the company s business philosophy is to operate as a community bank with local decision making  principally in non metropolitan markets  providing a broad array of banking and financial services to retail  commercial  and municipal customers 
the company s core operating objectives are i grow the branch network  primarily through a disciplined acquisition strategy  and certain selective de novo expansions  ii build profitable loan and deposit volume using both organic and acquisition strategies  iii increase the non interest income component of total revenues through development of banking related fee income  growth in existing financial services business units  and the acquisition of additional financial services and banking businesses  and iv utilize technology to deliver customer responsive products and services and to reduce operating costs 
significant factors management reviews to evaluate achievement of the company s operating objectives and its operating results and financial condition include  but are not limited to net income and earnings per share  return on assets and equity  net interest margins  noninterest income  operating expenses  asset quality  loan and deposit growth  capital management  performance of individual banking and financial services units  performance of specific product lines  liquidity and interest rate sensitivity  enhancements to customer products and services  technology advancements  market share  peer comparisons  and the performance of acquisition and integration activities 
the company s reported net income for the year of million  or per share  was above s reported earnings of million  or per share 
the results include a million benefit related to the settlement and a related change in a position taken on certain previously unrecognized tax positions  higher noninterest income  excluding securities gains and debt extinguishments costs  improved asset quality  and organic and acquired loan and deposit growth 
this was partially offset by a million pretax charge related to the early redemption of million of variable rate  trust preferred obligations  and the refinancing of million of federal home loan bank advances into lower cost instruments  and higher operating expenses 
last year s results included a million charge related to the early redemption of fixed rate  trust preferred obligations 
noninterest income  excluding gain loss on investment securities and debt extinguishments  increased over as a result of strong growth from both banking and non banking sources 
capital levels remained strong 
asset quality continued to improve in  with a reduction in the loan charge off  delinquency and nonperforming loan ratios versus the company experienced year over year loan growth in all portfolios consumer installment  consumer mortgage and business lending  due to both the tlnb acquisition and organic loan growth 
the investment portfolio increased from the prior year due to the reinvestment of portfolio cash flows as well as a million short term investment leverage strategy implemented in the third quarter 
average deposits increased in as compared to as the result of organic growth and the tlnb  onb and elmira acquisitions 
external borrowings increased from the end of december due primarily to the short term investment leverage strategy  partially offset by the early redemption of the million of fixed rate trust preferred securities in january net income and profitability net income for was million  or per share  up million  or  from s earnings of million  or per share 
the results include a million  or per share  pre tax charge related to the early redemption of million of variable rate  trust preferred obligations  as well as the refinancing of million of federal home loan bank advances into lower cost instruments 
the results also included a million  or per share  benefit related to the settlement and a related change in a position taken on certain previously unrecognized tax positions 
the earnings included a million  or per share  charge related to the early redemption of fixed rate  trust preferred obligations 
in addition to the earnings results presented above in accordance with gaap  the company provides cash earnings per share which excludes the after tax effect of the amortization of intangible assets  the market value adjustments on net assets acquired in mergers  and the noncash portion of debt extinguishments costs 
management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity and certain noncash transactions in reported results 
cash earnings per share for were  up from for the year ended december  net income and earnings per share for were million and  down from results 
in  the company generated a per share after tax gain through the sale of securities that had optimized their total return and interest rate sensitivity characteristics 
the earnings included incremental stock option expense of million  or per share  a million  or per share  charge related to the early redemption of fixed rate  trust preferred obligations  as well as million  or per share  of acquisition expenses and special charges 
the results were impacted by a million  or per share  nonrecurring charge related to the early retirement of certain executives 
table reconciliation of gaap net income to non gaap cash net income years ended december  s omitted net income after tax adjustments net amortization of market value adjustments on net assets acquired in mergers amortization of intangible assets noncash portion of debt extinguishments charge net income cash table condensed income statements years ended december  s omitted  except per share data net interest income loan loss provision noninterest income operating expenses income before taxes income taxes net income diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share cash cash earnings are reconciled to gaap net income in table the primary factors explaining performance are discussed in detail in the remaining sections of this document and are summarized as follows as shown in table above  net interest income increased million  or  due to a million increase in average earning assets  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the net interest margin 
average loans grew million or  primarily due to strong consumer installment and retail mortgage growth as well as the addition of tlnb in june  onb in december  and elmira in august average investments increased million  or in short term cash equivalents also increased million as compared to the end of a majority of the growth in earning assets was funded by million  or  higher average deposits  primarily due to the acquisitions of tlnb  onb and elmira 
average borrowings increased million due to the incremental investment leverage  as well as the three acquisitions completed since august the loan loss provision of million decreased million  or  from the prior year level 
net charge offs of million decreased by million from  reducing the net charge off ratio net charge offs total average loans to for the year 
the company s asset quality became even more favorable in as evidenced by improvement in key metrics such as nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans  nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned  and delinquent loans days through nonaccruing as a percentage of total loans 
additional information on trends and policy related to asset quality is provided in the asset quality section on pages through noninterest income for of million increased by million  or  from s level  due both to organic growth and the acquisitions of hbt  tlnb  onb and elmira  partially offset by a million debt refinancing charge  comprised of the refinance of certain federal home loan bank advances and the early redemption of million of trust preferred securities 
fees from banking services were up million or  primarily due to several revenue enhancement initiatives implemented over the last two years  as well as the acquisitions completed in and financial services revenue was million  or higher  mostly from strong growth at the company s benefit plan administration and consulting business and the acquisition of hbt 
in the company also incurred a million charge related to the early redemption of million of fixed rate trust preferred obligations 
total operating expenses increased million or in to million 
the increase was primarily attributable to incremental operating expenses related to the tlnb  hbt  elmira and onb acquisitions 
additionally  expenses were up due to higher business development costs  a more robust marketing strategy  higher volume based processing costs  and increased expenses related to investments in the technology and facilities infrastructure 
the company s combined effective federal and state income tax rate decreased percentage points in to  primarily as a result of a settlement of certain previously unrecognized tax positions and a higher proportion of tax exempt income in part due to the higher debt restructuring charges in selected profitability and other measures return on average assets  return on average equity  dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows table selected ratios return on average assets return on average equity dividend payout ratio average equity to average assets as displayed in table above  the return on average assets increased in as compared to and decreased as compared to the increase in comparison to was a result of higher net income primarily due to the and acquisitions and the improved asset quality 
the decrease from to was a result of lower net income primarily due to lower gains on sale of investment securities and lower net interest income 
reported return on equity in was higher than  but below s level 
the dividend payout ratio for was below s level due to a larger increase in net income than the increase in dividends declared 
the dividend payout ratio increased in as compared to  due to the decrease in net income and the increase in the quarterly dividend rate 
net interest income net interest income is the amount that interest and fees on earning assets loans and investments exceeds the cost of funds  which consists primarily of interest paid to the company s depositors and interest on external borrowings 
net interest margin is the difference between the gross yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
as disclosed in table  net interest income with nontaxable income converted to a fully tax equivalent basis totaled million in  up million  or  from the prior year 
a million increase in average interest earning assets more than offset a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities and a basis point decrease in the net interest margin 
as reflected in table  the volume changes mentioned above increased net interest income by million  while the lower net interest margin had a million negative impact 
the net interest margin declined basis points from in to in this decline was primarily attributable to a basis point increase in the cost of funds having a greater impact than the nine basis point increase in earning asset yields 
the increased cost of funds was due to rising rates on deposit products  primarily time deposits in the first three quarters of the year  as the rates on new volume were above those of maturing time deposits  in part due to increases in short term market rates in and the rates on external borrowings decreased throughout the year  as a result of the early redemption of fixed rate trust preferred securities in the first quarter of and four rate reductions by the federal reserve to the overnight federal funds rates since august of the yield on loans increased basis points in the yield on investments decreased from in to in as the yields on the investments increased in the first half of the year and declined during the third and fourth quarters  due mostly to the leveraging strategy undertaken in mid  as well as declines in short and medium term rates in the second half of the year 
the net interest margin in was  compared to in this basis point decline was primarily attributable to the four rate hikes basis points each by the federal reserve to the overnight federal funds rates in the first half of  having a greater impact on funding costs up basis points than earning asset yields up basis points 
the rising short term market rates resulted in steady increases to rates throughout the year on interest bearing deposits up basis points and total external borrowings up basis points 
the yield on loans increased basis points  with the majority of the increases occurring in the second and third quarters  reflective of the timing of the federal reserve s rate increases 
the yield on investments increased slightly from in to in as the sold  maturing and called securities had yields similar to those of the overall portfolio 
as shown in table  total interest income increased by million  or  in table reveals that higher average earning assets contributed a positive million variance and higher yields contributed million 
average loans grew a total of million in  as a result of million from the acquisitions of tlnb in june  onb in december and elmira in august as well as million of organic growth in the consumer mortgage and consumer installment portfolios 
interest and fees on loans increased million or 
the increase was attributable to higher average loan balances as well as a basis point increase in loan yields due to the increase in short term rates in the first half of the year 
total interest income increased by million  or in table indicates that higher average earning assets contributed a positive million variance and higher yields contributed million or of the improvement 
average loans grew million in over  as a result of million from the acquisitions of elmira and onb and million of total organic growth from all portfolios 
interest and fees on loans increased million  or  in as compared to the increase was attributable to higher average loan balances  as well as a basis point increase in loan yields due to increases in short term rates 
in  the company sold certain investment securities in the then flat yield environment  to take advantage of market conditions to shorten the average life of the portfolio and to maximize its total return 
in  the portfolio continued to decline due to the contractual maturing and early calling of securities 
the cash flows were used to pay down short term borrowings and the excess funds invested in short term cash equivalents  as long term investments were not attractive due to market conditions 
as a result  average investments for decreased million versus  partially offset by an increase in cash equivalents of million 
the expected life to maturity of the investment portfolio was reduced from years at december  to at december  refer to the investments section of the md a on pages through for further information 
during the third quarter of  a million short term investment leverage strategy was initiated  which produced positive net interest income and served to demonstrate the company s ability to freely access liquidity sources despite tightened credit market conditions 
investment interest income in of million was million  or  higher than the prior year as a result of a larger portfolio positive million impact  partially offset by a six basis point decrease in the investment yield 
the increase in the portfolio was a result of the short term leverage strategy implemented in the third quarter of investment interest income in of million was million  or  lower than the prior year as a result of a smaller portfolio negative million impact 
the performance of the investment portfolio in and remained strong despite the interest rate environment 
the average earning asset yield grew nine basis points to in because of the previously mentioned increase in loan yields  partially offset by the decrease in the investment yields 
the average earning asset yield grew basis points to in from in during  changes in market interest rates combined with the strategic investment portfolio actions previously discussed resulted in the yield on the loan portfolio being higher than the investment portfolio by basis points 
this gap widened in as the yield on the loan portfolio expanded and investment portfolio yield stabilized resulting in loan yields being basis points higher than the yield on the investment portfolio 
in  the gap increased to basis points as the yield on the loan portfolio continued to expand while the yield on the investment portfolio decreased slightly reflective of the loan portfolio having a significant proportion of variable and adjustable rate loans which benefited from higher rates  principally in the first half of the year  whereas the investment portfolio was predominately comprised of fixed rate instruments 
total average funding deposits and borrowings in increased million or 
deposits increased million  million attributable to the acquisitions of tlnb  onb and elmira and million to organic deposit growth 
interest bearing deposits increased million as a result of acquisitions  the continued emphasis of new interest bearing checking account products  and customers shifting funds from noninterest checking deposits to time and other higher rate deposit products as rates rose 
average external borrowings increased million in as compared to the prior year due primarily to the incremental leverage strategy in the third quarter 
in total average funding remained consistent with s level 
deposits increased million  million attributable to the acquisitions of elmira and onb and million due to organic deposit growth 
average external borrowings declined million in as compared to the prior year as cash flows from the maturing securities were used to reduce short term borrowings 
the cost of funding increased basis points during the first half of and decreased five basis points in the fourth quarter of reflective of the increases to short term rates by the federal reserve in and the subsequent decreases experienced in the second half of interest rates on deposit accounts were raised throughout the first half of the year  with increases in all product offerings 
the primary drivers of the increase in deposit cost of funds were customers transferring funds from non interest checking and lower rate interest accounts to higher yielding time deposit accounts  as well as transferring noninterest bearing accounts to new interest bearing checking products 
this trend is demonstrated by the percentage of average deposits that were in time deposit accounts and interest bearing checking accounts increasing from and  respectively  in to and  respectively  in  while noninterest checking deposits  savings and money market accounts decreased from  and  respectively  in  to  and  respectively  in the prepayment of trust preferred securities in early and the inverted yield curve that existed throughout contributed to the decrease in the interest rate differential between short and long term debt instruments 
total interest expense increased by million to million in as shown in table  higher interest rates on deposits and external borrowings resulted in million of this increase  while the higher deposit and borrowings balances accounted for million of the increase in interest expense 
interest expense as a percentage of earning assets increased by basis points to 
the rate on interest bearing deposits increased basis points to  due largely to increases in time deposits and money market rates throughout and the previously discussed shifting of funds to higher rate deposit products 
the rate on external borrowings decreased basis points to because of the aforementioned early redemption of fixed rate trust preferred obligations as well as the favorable rates on borrowings associated with the leverage strategy undertaken in mid total interest expense increased by million to million in as compared to higher interest rates accounted for the vast majority of the increase 
the rate on interest bearing deposits increased basis points to and the rate on external borrowings increased basis points to in the following table sets forth information related to average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and their associated yields and rates for the years ended december   and interest income and yields are on a fully tax equivalent basis using marginal income tax rates of in  in  and in average balances are computed by totaling the daily ending balances in a period and dividing by the number of days in that period

refer to the investments section of the md a on pages through for further information 
total noninterest income  excluding security gains and debt extinguishments costs  of million for increased by over  largely as a result of higher utilization of bank services and growth at bpas 
noninterest income as a percent of operating income fte basis was in  up percentage points from the prior year 
excluding the gain loss on investment securities and debt extinguishments  noninterest income as a percent of operating income fte basis was in  a percentage point increase from for this increase was primarily driven by the aforementioned strong growth in recurring bank fees  bpas income  as well as the adverse impact the basis point decrease in the net interest margin had on that segment of revenue 
this ratio is considered an important measure for determining the progress the company is making on one of its primary long term strategies  which is the expansion of noninterest income in order to diversify its revenue sources and reduce reliance on net interest margins that may be strongly impacted by general interest rate and other market conditions 
the largest portion of the company s recurring noninterest income is the wide variety of fees earned from general banking services  which reached million in  up from the prior year 
a large portion of the income growth was attributable to electronic banking fees  up million  or  over s level  due in large part to a concerted effort to increase the penetration and utilization of consumer debit cards as well as the introduction of a business debit card program 
overdraft fees were also up million  or  over s level  driven by core deposit account growth 
mortgage banking fees increased million  or  primarily due to the addition of a million serviced loan portfolio in conjunction with the elmira acquisition in august fees from general banking services were million in  up million or from  primarily driven by growth in overdraft fees  commissions and electronic banking  generated from several revenue enhancement initiatives put into place during and core deposit account growth 
as disclosed in table  noninterest income from financial services including revenues from benefit plan consulting and administration and wealth management services rose million  or  in to million 
financial services revenue now comprises of total noninterest income  excluding net gains losses on the sale of investment securities and debt extinguishments 
strong performance at bpas generated revenue growth of million  or  for the year  achieved primarily through the acquisition of hbt  new product offerings and expanded market coverage 
bpas offers their clients daily valuation  actuarial and employee benefit consulting services on a national basis from offices in upstate new york  houston  and pittsburgh 
bpas revenue of million in was million higher than s results  driven by enhanced service offerings to both new and existing clients 
cisi generated revenue growth of  or  in primarily through the addition of new financial consultants and improved sales penetration 
nottingham generated revenue growth of  in  achieved primarily through the attraction of net new client assets and market appreciation 
revenue at personal trust declined  or  during excluding certain estate fees generated in the first quarter of  trust services income increased slightly 
cbna insurance  acquired in june of  generated revenue of  in  personal trust had positive revenue growth of  or   achieved primarily through the generation of estate settlement fees 
cisi generated revenue growth of  or in primarily through the addition of new financial consultants 
revenues at nottingham declined  or during as it transitioned to a new management team  new branding and the broadening of its product offerings 
assets under management and administration at the company s financial services businesses rose considerably over the last two years  reaching billion at the end of  up from billion at year end and billion at year end market driven gains in equity based assets were augmented by attraction of new client assets and the acquisition of hbt 
bpa  in particular  was successful at growing its asset base  as demonstrated by the approximately million increase in its assets under administration during  excluding assets added through the acquisition of hbt 
in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a million charge related to the early redemption of its million  variable rate trust preferred obligations  which included a premium call provision at 
additionally  the company incurred a million charge to refinance million of federal home loan bank advances into similar duration  lower cost instruments 
in the company incurred a million charge related to the early redemption of its million  fixed rate trust preferred obligations  which included a premium call provision at 
there were no gains or losses on security transactions in as compared to gains of million in  as the company took advantage of market conditions in to sell certain securities in order to maximize their expected total return 
securities sold included million of us treasury and agency securities  million of aaa rated obligations of state and political subdivisions and million of investment grade corporate bonds 
the corresponding gains recognized on these sales were million  million and million  respectively 
the security and debt gains and losses taken over the last three years are illustrative of the company s active management of its investment portfolio and external borrowings to achieve a desirable total return through the combination of net interest income  transaction gains losses and changes in market value across financial market cycles  as well as achieving an appropriate interest rate sensitivity profile in changing rate environments 
operating expenses as shown in table  operating expenses increased million  or  in to million primarily due to the four acquisitions completed in and  as well as higher merit based personnel expenses  business development and volume based processing costs 
operating expenses in declined million or from excluding special charges acquisition expenses  operating expenses were up million  or  in  primarily attributable to the effect of adopting sfas r  increased business development and marketing expenses  and operating expenses related to the acquisitions of elmira and onb  partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets 
operating expenses for as a percent of average assets were  up basis points from in both and this ratio was impacted by the comparatively high growth rates of the financial service businesses  which are less asset intensive with higher efficiency ratio attributes 
the efficiency ratio  a performance measurement tool widely used by banks  is defined by the company as operating expenses excluding special charges acquisition expenses and intangible amortization divided by operating income fully tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding net securities and debt gains and losses 
lower ratios are often correlated to higher efficiency 
in the efficiency ratio increased percentage points to due to a increase in operating expenses having a greater impact than a increase in net interest income and a increase in noninterest income excluding net securities gains and debt extinguishments costs 
the efficiency ratio for was percentage points higher than the ratio for due to a increase in operating expenses and a decline in the net interest income having a greater impact than a increase in noninterest income excluding net securities gains and debt extinguishments costs 
in both periods  operating income growth was inhibited by the contraction of the net interest margin 
in addition  the efficiency ratios were adversely affected by the growing proportion of financial services activities  which due to the differing nature of their business carry high efficiency ratios

additionally  approximately million of the increase can be attributed to annual merit increases  along with million higher medical costs and increased headcount  excluding the acquisitions 
salaries and benefits increased million or in primarily due to costs associated with the acquisition of elmira and onb  higher stock option and retirement plan expense  partially offset by higher deferred loan origination costs 
the increase of stock option expense of million related to the adoption of sfas r  which required the recognition of expense based on the fair value of the options on the grant date 
total full time equivalent staff at the end of was  compared to  at december  and  at the end of medical expenses increased million in  or  due to a general rise in the cost of medical care  administration and insurance  as well as a greater number of insured employees 
additional vision and dental coverage were added in at an incremental cost of million to bring the company s benefit offerings more closely in line with peers 
medical expenses declined in as a result of proactive claims management  lower utilization  and a change in plan administrators 
qualified and nonqualified pension expenses decreased in principally due to the return on assets for contributions made to the plan in  partially offset by increases in retiree medical expense due to the general rise in the cost of medical care 
in  qualified and nonqualified pension expense was million lower than due to the special charge taken in related to certain early retirement actions 
the three assumptions that have the largest impact on the calculation of annual pension expense are the discount rate utilized  the rate applied to future compensation increases and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
see note k to the financial statements for further information concerning the pension plan 
total non personnel operating expense increased million or in as displayed in table  this was largely caused by higher customer processing and communication expense up million  business development and marketing up million  other expenses up million  occupancy and equipment expense up million  legal and professional up million  office supplies and postage up million  and  amortization of intangible assets up million  partially offset by decreases in  foreclosed property expenses down million 
the increase in data processing and communications costs as well as the increase in business development and marketing expenses reflects the company s continued investments in strategic technology and business development initiatives to grow and enhance its service offerings 
a majority of the remaining increase in nonpersonnel operating costs is attributable to million of expenses added as a result of the four acquisitions in and the company continually evaluates all aspects of its operating expense structure and is diligent about identifying opportunities to improve operating efficiencies

the other comprehensive loss is comprised of a million charge for the adoption of sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas  a million decline in the mva  partially offset by a million increase in the fair value of interest rate swaps 
the adoption of sfas required that the funded status of all defined benefit pension and postretirement plans be recorded as an asset or liability on the company s consolidated statement of condition with a corresponding offset  net of taxes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
excluding accumulated other comprehensive income in both and  capital rose by million  or 
shares outstanding decreased by  during the year  comprised of  added through employee stock plans  offset by the purchase of  treasury shares 
the company s ratio of tier capital to assets or tier leverage ratio  the basic measure for which regulators have established a minimum for an institution to be considered well capitalized  decreased basis points at year end to 
this was primarily the result of the early call of the million of fixed rate trust preferred securities in the first quarter and assets from the onb and tlnb being included in average assets for the entire quarter versus only one month of onb assets included in the ratio for december  the tangible equity tangible assets ratio was at the end of versus one year earlier 
the decline was due to a larger increase in total assets as a result of the acquisition of hbt and tlnb  and organic growth resulting in the assets growing at a faster rate than shareholders equity  whose growth was dampened by treasury stock purchases 
the company manages organic and acquired growth in a manner that enables it to continue to build upon its strong capital base  and maintain the company s ability to take advantage of future strategic growth opportunities 
cash dividends declared on common stock in of million represented an increase of over the prior year 
this growth was mostly a result of dividends per share of for increasing from in  a result of quarterly dividends per share being raised from to in the third quarter of and from to in the third quarter of partially offsetting the increase in the dividend was a decrease in the number of shares outstanding due to treasury stock purchases 
the dividend payout ratio for this year was compared to in  and in the change in is a result of the aforementioned increase in dividends declared being smaller than the increase in net income 
the significant change in was a result of a increase in dividends declared combined with a decrease in net income 
liquidity liquidity risk is measured by the company s ability to raise cash when needed at a reasonable cost and minimize any loss 
the company must be capable of meeting all obligations to its customers at any time and  therefore  the active management of its liquidity position is critical 
given the uncertain nature of our customers demands as well as the company s desire to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities  the company must have available adequate sources of on and off balance sheet funds that can be acquired in time of need 
accordingly  in addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cash flows  liquidity must be supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines from correspondent banks  the federal home loan bank  and federal reserve bank 
other funding alternatives may also be appropriate from time to time  including wholesale and retail repurchase agreements  large certificates of deposit  and brokered cd relationships 
the company s primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the basic surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the amount of cash that could be made available within days calculated as liquid assets less short term liabilities as a percentage of total assets  and second  a projection of subsequent cash availability over an additional days 
as of december   this ratio was and for the respective time periods  excluding the company s capacity to borrow additional funds from the federal home loan bank and other sources  as compared to the bank policy that requires a minimum of 
there is currently million in additional federal home loan bank borrowing capacity based on the company s year end collateral levels 
additionally  the company has million in unused capacity at the federal reserve bank and million in unused capacity from unsecured lines of credit with other correspondent banks 
in addition to the and day basic surplus deficit model  longer term liquidity over a minimum of five years is measured and a liquidity analysis projecting sources and uses of funds is prepared 
to measure longer term liquidity  a baseline projection of loan and deposit growth for five years is made to reflect how liquidity levels could change over time 
this five year measure reflects ample liquidity for loan growth over the next five years 
though remote  the possibility of a funding crisis exists at all financial institutions 
accordingly  management has addressed this issue by formulating a liquidity contingency plan  which has been reviewed and approved by both the board of directors and the company s asset liability management committee 
the plan addresses those actions the company would take in response to both a short term and long term funding crisis 
a short term funding crisis would most likely result from a shock to the financial system  either internal or external  which disrupts orderly short term funding operations 
such a crisis should be temporary in nature and would not involve a change in credit ratings 
a long term funding crisis would most likely be the result of drastic credit deterioration at the company 
management believes that both circumstances have been fully addressed through detailed action plans and the establishment of trigger points for monitoring such events 
intangible assets intangible assets at the end of totaled million  an increase of million from the prior year end due to million of additional intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of hbt and tlnb  and minor adjustments to the intangible assets from the elmira and onb acquisitions  offset by million of amortization during the year 
intangible assets consist of goodwill  core deposit value and customer relationships arising from acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill at december  amounted to million  comprised of million related to banking acquisitions and million arising from the acquisition of financial services businesses 
goodwill is subjected to periodic impairment analysis to determine whether the carrying value of the acquired net assets exceeds their fair value  which would necessitate a write down of the goodwill 
the company completed its goodwill impairment analyses during and and no adjustments were necessary 
the impairment analysis was based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific risk indicators 
management believes that there is a low probability of future impairment with regard to the goodwill associated with whole bank and branch acquisitions 
the performance of nottingham previously elias asset management weakened subsequent to its acquisition in as a result of adverse market conditions  however  its performance stabilized in and improved in certain organizational and structural changes were made late in and  including re branding efforts that included changing its name from elias asset management to nottingham  to underscore the enhanced product and service offerings it has recently developed 
however  declines in nottingham s operating results may cause future impairment to its recorded goodwill of million 
core deposit intangibles represent the premium the company has paid for deposits acquired in excess of the cost that would have been incurred had the funds been purchased in the capital markets 
core deposit intangibles are amortized on either an accelerated or straight line basis over periods ranging from seven to twenty years 
the recognition of customer relationship intangibles arose due to the acquisitions of harbridge and hbt 
these assets were determined based on a methodology that calculates the present value of the projected future revenue derived from the acquired customer base 
these assets are being amortized over twelve years on an accelerated basis 
loans the company s loans outstanding  by type  as of december are as follows table loans outstanding s omitted consumer mortgage business lending consumer installment net loans allowance for loans loans  net of allowance for loan losses as disclosed in table above  gross loans outstanding reached a record level of billion as of year end  up million or compared to twelve months earlier 
the acquisition of tlnb accounted for million of the growth 
excluding the impact of the tlnb  onb and elmira acquisitions  total loans rose million or 
the organic loan growth was produced in each of business lending  consumer mortgage and consumer installment portfolios 
the compounded annual growth rate cagr for the company s total loan portfolio between and was comprised of approximately organic growth  with the remainder coming from acquisitions 
the greatest overall expansion occurred in the business lending segment  which grew at a cagr including the impact of acquisitions over that time frame 
the consumer mortgage segment grew at a compounded annual growth rate of from to the consumer mortgage growth was primarily driven by record mortgage refinancing volumes over the last five years  as well as the acquisition of consumer oriented banks and branches in that time period 
business lending balances accounted for of total loans at year end compared to at december   mostly due to the high proportion of business loans in the portfolios of two of the acquisitions completed during this time period 
consumer installment loans  largely home equity loans and borrowings originated in automobile  marine and recreational vehicle dealerships experienced a compounded annual growth rate of over the last years 
the weighting of retail lending in the company s loan portfolio enables it to be highly diversified 
approximately of loans outstanding at the end of were made to consumers borrowing on an installment  line of credit or residential mortgage loan basis 
the business lending portfolio is also broadly diversified by industry type as demonstrated by the following distributions at year end commercial real estate  healthcare  general services  retail trade  construction  agriculture  manufacturing  motor vehicle and parts dealers  restaurant lodging  and wholesale trade 
a variety of other industries with less than a share of the total portfolio comprise the remaining 
the consumer mortgage portion of the company s loan portfolio is comprised of fixed and adjustable rate residential lending 
consumer mortgages increased million or in excluding the impact of the tlnb  onb and elmira acquisitions  the consumer mortgage portfolio was up million or in during and  record levels of refinancing activity were driven by mortgage rates that were at or near year lows 
consumer mortgage growth has returned closer to historic levels since  as the pace of refinancing slowed after an extended period of elevated demand in the low rate environment 
consumer mortgage growth was comparatively stronger over the last year despite relatively stable long term interest rates 
the consumer real estate portfolio does not include exposure to subprime  alt a  or other higher risk mortgage products 
the company s solid performance during a tumultuous period in the overall industry is a reflection of the stable  low risk profile of its portfolio and its ability to successfully meet customer needs at a time when some national mortgage lenders are restricting their lending activities in many of the company s markets 
growth in the consumer mortgage portfolio in would have been if the sale of million of longer term  fixed rate mortgages in the secondary market had not been conducted 
these mortgages were sold in the secondary market to improve the company s interest rate risk position 
the combined total of general purpose business lending  dealer floor plans and mortgages on commercial property is characterized as the company s business lending activity 
the business lending portfolio increased million or in excluding the impact of the tlnb  onb  and elmira acquisitions  this segment increased million or as compared to the prior year 
the organic growth generated in was contributed by every major product line within business lending except dealer floor plans  where levels have been purposely managed downwards over the last few years due to the competitive weakness in this sector 
the company continues to face competitive conditions in most of its markets and it maintains its commitment to generating growth in its business portfolio in a manner that adheres to its twin goals of maintaining strong asset quality and producing profitable margins 
consumer installment loans  both those originated directly such as personal loans and home equity loans and lines of credit  and indirectly originated predominantly in automobile  marine and recreational vehicle dealerships  rose million or from one year ago 
excluding the impact of the tlnb  onb and elmira acquisitions  this segment increased million or 
continued moderate interest rates by historical standards  aggressive dealer and manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  and enhanced business development efforts have helped drive strong growth in this segment over the last several years 
the following table shows the maturities and type of interest rates for business and construction loans as of december  table maturity distribution of business and construction loans s omitted maturing in one year or less maturing after one but within five years maturing after five years commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction total fixed or predetermined interest rates floating or adjustable interest rates total scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category in which the payment is due

as shown in table above  nonperforming loans  defined as nonaccruing loans plus accruing loans days or more past due  ended at million  down approximately million or from one year earlier 
the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans decreased basis points from the prior year to 
the ratio of nonperforming assets which includes troubled debt restructuring and other real estate owned  or oreo  in addition to nonperforming loans to total loans plus oreo decreased to at year end  down basis points from one year earlier 
the improvement was driven by continued focus on maintaining strict underwriting standards  enhanced collection and recovery efforts  and the charge off and disposition of certain problematic loans in prior years 
had nonaccrual loans for the year ended december  been current in accordance with their original terms  additional interest income of approximately million would have been recorded 
at year end  the company was managing oreo properties with a value of million  as compared to oreo properties with a value of million a year earlier 
total delinquencies  defined as loans days or more past due or in nonaccrual status  finished the current year at of total loans outstanding versus at the end of as of year end  total delinquency ratios for commercial loans  consumer loans  and real estate mortgages were   and  respectively 
these measures were  and  respectively  as of december  delinquency levels  particularly in the to days category  tend to be somewhat volatile due to their measurement at a point in time  and therefore management believes that it is useful to evaluate this ratio over a longer period 
the average quarter end delinquency ratio for total loans in was  down from an average of in the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the last five years is as follows table allowance for loan loss activity years ended december  s omitted except for ratios allowance for loan losses at beginning of period charge offs business lending consumer mortgage consumer installment total charge offs recoveries business lending consumer mortgage consumer installment total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses allowance on acquired loans allowance for loan losses at end of period amount of loans outstanding at end of period daily average amount of loans net of unearned discount net charge offs average loans outstanding this reserve addition is attributable to loans acquired from tlnb in  elmira and onb in  first heritage bank in  and peoples bankcorp inc and grange national banc corp in as displayed in table above  total net charge offs in were million  down million from the prior year  principally due to significantly improved results in the business lending and consumer installment portfolios  partially offset by a slight increase in consumer mortgage 
net charge offs in were million below s level  benefiting from improved results in the consumer installment portfolio  offset by increased net charge offs in the business lending portfolio 
a period of economic weakness in our markets from late through early impacted the net charge off levels in  with the greatest impact being realized in the business loan and consumer installment segments 
due to the significant increases in average loan balances over time due to acquisition and organic growth  management believes that net charge offs as a percent of average loans net charge off ratio offers a more meaningful representation of asset quality trends 
the net charge off ratio for was down basis points from  to 
this year s ratio benefited from improved gross charge off and recovery performance 
gross charge offs as a percentage of average loans dropped basis points to in enhanced recovery efforts were evidenced by recoveries of million  representing of average gross charge offs for the latest two years  compared to in business loan net charge offs decreased in  totaling million or of average business loans outstanding versus million or in the higher net charge off ratio in was primarily attributable to loans associated with three commercial relationships in the auto industry 
consumer installment loan net charge offs decreased to million this year from million in  reducing the net charge off ratio basis points to  due to improved collection efforts and disciplined underwriting processes 
consumer mortgage net charge offs increased million to million in  and the net charge off ratio remained consistent at 
management continually evaluates the credit quality of the company s loan portfolio and conducts a formal review of the allowance for loan loss adequacy on a quarterly basis 
the two primary components of the loan review process that are used to determine proper allowance levels are specific and general loan loss allocations 
measurement of specific loan loss allocations is typically based on expected future cash flows  collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay 
impaired loans greater than million are evaluated for specific loan loss allocations  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended 
consumer mortgages and consumer installment loans are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more 
the second component of the allowance establishment process  general loan loss allocations  is composed of two calculations that are computed on the four main loan segments business lending  consumer direct  consumer indirect and residential real estate 
the first calculation determines an allowance level based on the latest three years of historical net charge off data for each loan category commercial loans exclude balances with specific loan loss allocations 
the second calculation is qualitative and takes into consideration five major factors affecting the level of loan loss risk portfolio risk migration patterns internal credit quality trends  the growth of the segments of the loan portfolio  economic and business environment trends in the company s markets includes review of bankruptcy  unemployment  population  consumer spending and regulatory trends  industry  geographical and product concentrations in the portfolio  and the perceived effectiveness of managerial resources and lending practices and policies 
these two allowance calculations are added together to determine the general loan loss allocation 
the allowance levels computed from the specific and general loan loss allocation methods are combined to derive the necessary allowance for loan loss to be reflected on the consolidated statement of condition 
the loan loss provision is calculated by subtracting the previous period allowance for loan loss  net of the interim period net charge offs  from the current required allowance level 
this provision is then recorded in the income statement for that period 
members of senior management and the loan alco committee of the board of directors review the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss quarterly 
management is committed to continually improving the credit assessment and risk management capabilities of the company and has dedicated the resources necessary to ensure advancement in this critical area of operations 
the allowance for loan loss increased to million at year end from million at the end of the million increase was due to the million additional loans from the tlnb acquisition as well as million of organic loan growth  partially offset by the company s improving asset quality profile 
the allowance level was also impacted by the increased proportion of low risk consumer mortgage and home equity loans in the overall loan portfolio  as a result of both organic and acquired growth 
the ratio of the allowance for loan loss to total loans decreased five basis points to for year end as compared to for and for primarily due to the improved asset quality profile 
management believes the year end allowance for loan losses to be adequate in light of the probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the loan loss provision of million in decreased by million or as a result of management s assessment of the probable losses in the loan portfolio  and the reduced level of charge offs in  as discussed above 
the loan loss provision as a percentage of average loans decreased from in to this year in most part due to the improving asset quality trends 
the loan loss provision was of net charge offs this year versus in  reflective of an improving asset quality profile  particularly in the commercial segment of the portfolio 
the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category as of the dates indicated  as well as the percentage of loans in each category to total loans 
this allocation is based on management s assessment  as of a given point in time  of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes when the risk factors of each component part change 
the allocation is not indicative of either the specific amounts of the loan categories in which future charge offs may be taken  nor should it be taken as an indicator of future loss trends 
the allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category 
table allowance for loan losses by loan type s omitted except for ratios allowance loan mix allowance loan mix allowance loan mix allowance loan mix allowance loan mix consumer mortgage business lending consumer installment unallocated total as demonstrated in table above and discussed previously  business lending by its nature carries higher credit risk than consumer mortgage or consumer installment loans  and as a result a disproportionate amount of the allowance for loan losses is deemed necessary for this portfolio 
the unallocated allowance increased from million in to million in as in prior years  the unallocated allowance is maintained for inherent losses in the portfolio not reflected in the historical loss ratios  model imprecision and for the acquired loan portfolios  including tlnb  onb and elmira 
funding sources the company utilizes a variety of funding sources to support the earning asset base as well as to achieve targeted growth objectives 
overall funding is comprised of three primary sources that possess a variety of maturity  stability  and price characteristics deposits of individuals  partnerships and corporations ipc deposits  collateralized municipal deposits public funds  and external borrowings 
the average daily amount of deposits and the average rate paid on each of the following deposit categories are summarized below for the years indicated table average deposits s omitted  except rates average balance average rate paid average balance average rate paid average balance average rate paid noninterest checking deposits interest checking deposits regular savings deposits money market deposits time deposits total deposits as displayed in table above  total average deposits for equaled billion  up million or from the prior year 
excluding the average deposits acquired from tlnb  onb and elmira  average deposits increased million or 
average deposits in were up million or from the majority of the increase was the result of deposits obtained through the elmira and onb acquisitions in the second and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the company s funding composition continues to benefit from a high level of ipc deposits  which reached an all time high in with an average balance of billion  an increase of million or over the comparable period 
this increase was comprised of million from the acquisitions of tlnb  onb and elmira  with the remaining increase derived from organic growth 
ipc deposits are frequently considered to be a bank s most attractive source of funding because they are generally stable  do not need to be collateralized  have a relatively low cost  and provide a strong customer base for which a variety of loan  deposit and other financial service related products can be sold 
full year average deposits of local municipalities declined million or during  with the tlnb  onb and elmira acquisitions accounting for million of additional municipal deposits 
municipal deposit balances tend to be more volatile than ipc deposits because they are heavily impacted by the seasonality of tax collection and fiscal spending patterns  as well as the longer term financial position of the government entities  which can change significantly from year to year 
the company is required to collateralize all local government deposits with marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of this stipulation  as well as the competitive bidding nature of this product  management considers municipal time deposit funding to be similar to external borrowings and thus prices these products on a consistent basis 
the mix of average deposits in changed slightly in comparison to the weightings of interest checking and time deposits increased from their levels  while noninterest checking deposits  savings  and money market weightings decreased 
this change in deposit mix reflects new product introductions  proactive marketing and increasing yields on time deposit accounts throughout the year 
the average balance for time deposit accounts increased from of the total deposits in to of total deposits this year 
the average balance for interest checking accounts increased from of the total deposits in to of total deposits this year 
this shift in mix  combined with higher average interest rates in all interest bearing deposit product categories caused the cost of interest bearing deposits to rise to in  as compared to in and in the remaining maturities of time deposits in amounts of  or more outstanding as of december are as follows table time deposit  maturities s omitted less than three months three months to six months six months to one year over one year total external borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowing sources for the company include the federal home loan bank of new york and federal reserve bank of new york  as well as access to the repurchase market through established relationships with primary market security dealers 
the company also had approximately million in fixed and floating rate subordinated debt outstanding at the end of that is held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts 
in the first quarter of  the company elected to redeem early million of variable rate trust preferred securities 
the company also elected to redeem early million of fixed rate trust preferred securities in january in december  the company completed a sale of million of trust preferred securities 
the securities mature on december  at an annual rate equal to the three month libor rate plus 
the company used the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes including the early call of the million of fixed rate trust preferred securities 
at the time of the offering  the company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert the variable rate trust preferred securities into a fixed rate obligation for a term of five years at a fixed rate of 
external borrowings averaged million or of total funding sources for all of as compared to million or of total funding sources for the increase in this ratio was primarily attributable to both investment leveraging activities and the funding of acquisitions with cash over the past two years 
as shown in table on page  at year end  million or of external borrowings had remaining terms of one year or less  up considerably from million or at december  and million or at the end of this change in external funding mix is the result of a million short term leverage strategy entered into in the third quarter of funded with certain callable debt obligations classified as short term 
as displayed in table on page  the overall mix of funding has shifted in the percentage of funding derived from deposits decreased to in from in and in fhlb borrowings increased during as the company took advantage of improving spreads between short term convertible advances and certain short term investment opportunities 
this strategy not only produced positive net interest income  but it also served to demonstrate the company s ability to freely access liquidity sources despite tightened credit market conditions

these financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers  generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee 
these commitments consist principally of unused commercial and consumer credit lines 
standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of an underlying contract with a third party 
the credit risks associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to customers and are subject to normal credit policies 
collateral may be obtained based on management s assessment of the customer s creditworthiness 
the fair value of these commitments is immaterial for disclosure in accordance with fasb interpretation no

the contract amount of these off balance sheet financial instruments as of december is as follows table off balance sheet financial instruments s omitted commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit total investments the objective of the company s investment portfolio is to hold low risk  high quality earning assets that provide favorable returns and provide another effective tool to actively manage its asset liability position to maximize future net interest income opportunities 
this must be accomplished within the following constraints a implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income  b providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day to day business activities  c considering investment risk weights as determined by the regulatory risk based capital guidelines  and d generating a favorable return without undue compromise of the other requirements 
as displayed in table below  the book value of the company s investment portfolio increased million or during the year to billion 
in the second half of  the company took advantage of certain investment opportunities to increase the portfolio through a short term leverage strategy 
this strategy produced positive net interest income and served to demonstrate the company s ability to freely access liquidity sources despite tightened credit market conditions 
as of december   the expected life to maturity of the portfolio was years versus years as of december  average investment balances book value basis for increased million or versus the prior year 
investment interest income in was million or higher than the prior year as a result of the higher average balances in the portfolio  partially offset by a six basis point decrease in the average investment yield from to due in part to having a higher proportion of cash equivalent securities that carried a comparatively lower yield than the overall investment portfolio 
the company executed a number of sales strategies during with a focus on maximizing the total return performance of the portfolio

the corresponding pre tax gains on investment securities recognized on these sales were million  million and million  respectively 
all proceeds from these sales were used to repay short term borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york 
during  the investment portfolio continued to decline due to the contractual runoff of securities 
cash flows from the maturing securities were used to pay down short term borrowings and the excess were invested in short term interest bearing cash equivalents  as the long term investments alternatives were not attractive in the then flat yield curve environment 
the investment portfolio has limited credit risk due to the composition continuing to heavily favor us agency debentures  us agency mortgage backed pass throughs  us agency cmos and municipal bonds

mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are listed based on the contractual maturity 
actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations with or without penalties 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates  prices or credit risk 
credit risk associated with the company s loan portfolio has been previously discussed in the asset quality section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations starting on page although more than a third of the securities portfolio at year end was invested in municipal bonds  management believes that the tax risk of the company s municipal investments associated with potential future changes in statutory  judicial and regulatory actions is minimal 
the company also believes that it has an insignificant amount of credit risk in its investment portfolio because essentially all of the fixed income securities in the portfolio are aaa rated highest possible rating 
the company does not have any material foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure 
therefore  almost all the market risk in the investment portfolio is related to interest rates 
the ongoing monitoring and management of both interest rate risk and liquidity  in the short and long term time horizons is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by limits established in the policies reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the policies to the asset liability committee alco  which meets each month 
the committee is made up of the company s senior management as well as regional and line of business managers who oversee specific earning asset classes and various funding sources 
asset liability management the primary objective of the company s asset liability management process is to maximize earnings and return on capital within acceptable levels of risk 
as the company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements  it has maintained an appropriate process and set of measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk in varying rate environments 
the primary tools used by the company in managing interest rate risk are the income simulation model and economic value of equity modeling 
interest rate risk interest rate risk irr can result from the timing differences in the maturity repricing of an institution s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts  the effect of embedded options  such as loan prepayments  interest rate caps floors  and deposit withdrawals  and differences in the behavior of lending and funding rates  sometimes referred to as basis risk 
an example of basis risk would occur if floating rate assets and liabilities  with otherwise identical repricing characteristics  were based on market indexes that were imperfectly correlated 
given the potential types and differing related characteristics of irr  it is important that the company maintain an appropriate process and set of measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify its primary sources of irr 
the company also recognizes that effective management of irr includes an understanding of when potential adverse changes in interest rates will flow through the income statement 
accordingly  the company will manage its position so that it monitors its exposure to net interest income over both a one year planning horizon and a longer term strategic horizon 
it is the company s objective to manage its exposure to interest rate risk  bearing in mind that it will always be in the business of taking on rate risk and that rate risk immunization is not possible 
also  it is recognized that as exposure to interest rate risk is reduced  so too may net interest margin be reduced 
income simulation income simulation is tested on a wide variety of balance sheet and treasury yield curve scenarios 
the simulation projects changes in net interest income caused by the effect of changes in interest rates 
the model requires management to make assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from management s outlook  as are the assumptions used for new loan yields and deposit rates 
loan prepayment speeds are based on a combination of current industry averages and internal historical prepayments 
balance sheet and yield curve assumptions are analyzed and reviewed by the alco committee regularly 
the following table reflects the company s one year net interest income sensitivity  using december  asset and liability levels as a starting point 
the prime rate and federal funds rates are assumed to move up basis points and down basis points over a month period while the treasury curve shifts to spreads over federal funds that are more consistent with historical norms 
deposit rates are assumed to move in a manner that reflects the historical relationship between deposit rate movement and changes in the federal funds rate  generally reflecting of the movement of the federal funds rate 
cash flows are based on contractual maturity  optionality and amortization schedules along with applicable prepayments derived from internal historical data and external sources 
net interest income sensitivity model calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income at december changes in interest rates basis points basis points in the model  the rising rate environment reflects an increase in net interest income nii from a flat rate environment while nii decreases if rates were to fall 
the change in nii in both environments is largely due to assets repricing faster than corresponding liabilities 
over a longer time period the growth in nii improves significantly in a rising rate environment as lower yielding assets mature and are replaced at higher rates 
in the model  both the rising and falling rate environments reflect a reduction in nii from a flat rate environment 
initially  the rising rate environment reflects a decrease in nii from a flat rate environment largely due to short term capital market borrowings repricing as rates rise 
over a longer time period the growth in nii improves significantly in a rising rate environment as lower yielding assets mature and are replaced at higher rates 
in a falling rate environment  nii decreases as a result of assets repricing faster than liabilities 
the analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and other factors 
while the assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above 
those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and off balance sheet financial instruments 
such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and shifts in the maturity curve of interest rates and provide management with a long term interest rate risk metric
