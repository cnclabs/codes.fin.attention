see discussion of our business and the operations within our helicopter services segment under part i 
item business overview included elsewhere in this annual report 
our strategy our goal is to advance our position as the leading helicopter services provider to the offshore energy industry 
we intend to employ the following strategies to achieve this goal grow our business 
we plan to grow our business in most of the markets in which we operate and increase our revenue  profitability and fleet capacity 
we have a footprint in most major oil and gas producing regions of the world  and we have the opportunity to expand and deepen our presence in many of these markets 
we anticipate this growth will result primarily from the deployment of new aircraft into markets where we expect they will be most profitably employed  as well as by executing opportunistic acquisitions 
through our relationships with our existing customers  we are aware of future business opportunities in a broad range of the markets we currently serve that would require substantial capital expenditures relative to our current capital expenditure commitments 
our acquisition related growth may include increasing our role and participation with existing unconsolidated affiliates and may include increasing our position in existing markets or expanding into new markets 
strategically position our company as the preferred provider of helicopter services 
we position our company as the preferred provider of helicopter services by maintaining strong relationships with our customers and providing safe and high quality service 
we focus on maintaining relationships with our customers field operations and corporate management 
we believe that this focus helps us better anticipate customer needs and provide our customers with the right aircraft in the right place at the right time  which in turn allows us to better manage our existing fleet and capital investment program 
we also leverage our close relationships with our customers to establish mutually beneficial operating practices and safety standards worldwide 
by applying standard operating and safety practices across our global operations  we are able to provide our customers with consistent  high quality service in each of their areas of operation 
by better understanding our customers needs and by virtue of our global operations and safety standards  we have effectively competed against other helicopter service providers based on aircraft availability  customer service  safety and reliability  and not just price 
integrate our global operations 
we are an integrated global operator  and we intend to continue to identify and implement further opportunities to integrate our global organization 
in the past several years  we have changed our senior management team  integrated our operations among previously independently managed businesses  created a global flight and maintenance standards group  improved our global asset allocation and made other changes in our corporate operations 
we anticipate that these improvements and further integration opportunities will result in revenue growth  and may also generate cost savings 
consistent with our desire to maintain a conservative use of leverage to fund growth  we raised million of capital through the sale of preferred stock completed in september and october additionally  we raised million through the sale of senior notes completed in june and november as of march   we had commitments to purchase large  medium and training aircraft and options to purchase an additional large and medium aircraft 
depending on market conditions  we expect to exercise some or all of these options to purchase aircraft and may elect to expand our business through the purchase of other aircraft not currently under option and acquisition or investment in other helicopter operations  including acquisitions currently under consideration 
as part of our global fleet management program  prior to an aircraft coming off of a customer contract we evaluate our alternatives for use of the aircraft  including factors such as the cost and timing of future major maintenance  potential contracts in existing or other markets and potential sale of the aircraft 
market outlook we are currently experiencing significant demand for our helicopter services 
based on our current contract level and discussions with our customers about their needs for aircraft related to their oil and gas production and exploration plans  we anticipate the demand for helicopter services will continue at a very high level for the near term 
in addition  this high level of demand has allowed us to increase the rates we charge for our services over the past several years 
we expect to see growth in demand for additional helicopter services  particularly in north and south america  west africa and southeast asia 
we also expect that the relative importance of our other business units will continue to increase as oil and gas producers increasingly focus on prospects outside of north america and the north sea 
this growth will provide us with opportunities to add new aircraft to our fleet  as well as opportunities to redeploy aircraft into markets that will sustain higher rates for our services 
currently  helicopter manufacturers are indicating very limited supply availability for medium and large aircraft during the next two to three years 
we expect that this tightness in aircraft availability from the manufacturers and the lack of suitable aircraft in the secondary market  coupled with the increase in demand for helicopter services  will result in upward pressure on the rates we charge for our services 
we believe that our recent aircraft acquisitions and commitments position us to benefit from the current market conditions and to deploy new aircraft on order or under option at these favorable rates and contract terms

the increase in gross revenue is due primarily to improvements in our europe  west africa  southeast asia and south and central america business units as a result of increases in rates for helicopter services  increased demand for helicopter services from our existing customers and the addition of new aircraft  as well as the impact of the acquisitions of the bristow academy entities which generated million in revenue in fiscal year our operating expense increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase primarily resulted from higher costs associated with higher activity levels  maintenance costs  and salaries and benefits associated with the addition of personnel and salary increases  across a majority of our business units  as well as the impact of the acquisitions of the bristow academy entities which incurred million in expense in fiscal year primarily as a result of the improvement in rates  our operating income and operating margin for fiscal year increased to million and  respectively  compared to million and  respectively  for fiscal year fiscal year included the following significant items costs in our other international business unit related to a claim by a former agent whom we terminated in connection with the internal review  that decreased operating income by million  income from continuing operations by million and diluted earnings per share by 
retirement related expenses for two of our corporate officers that decreased operating income by million million recorded in our north america business unit  million in our south and central america business unit and million in our corporate results  income from continuing operations by million and diluted earnings per share by 
tax items that increased operating income by million  income from continuing operations by million and diluted earnings per share by 
these tax items included a reversal of accruals for sales tax contingency and employee taxes in west africa of million and million  respectively  and a reversal of accruals for employee taxes in europe of million  which are included in direct cost in our consolidated statement of income 
a million reduction in our provision for income taxes resulting from a benefit of million associated with the reduction in the corporate income tax rate in the uk and a benefit of million associated with an internal reorganization completed during fiscal year for further discussion of these items  see discussion of our business units under business unit operating results fiscal year compared to fiscal year included elsewhere in this annual report 
income from continuing operations for fiscal year of million represents a million increase from fiscal year this increase was driven by the improvement in operating income discussed above and foreign currency exchange gains of million in fiscal year compared to foreign currency exchange losses of million in fiscal year  partially offset by an increase in interest expense and our provision for income taxes which resulted from an increase in pre tax earnings  partially offset by the tax items discussed above 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year our gross revenue increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase in gross revenue relates to an increase in gross revenue across all of our business units  most significantly for north america primarily resulting from increases in rates for certain contracts and an increase in utilization of our small aircraft in this market  europe primarily resulting from new aircraft added to the market during fiscal year and west africa primarily resulting from an increase in rates under certain contracts and three new contracts 
the increase in gross revenue was also attributable to an increase in out of pocket expenses rebilled to our customers reimbursable revenue of million 
our operating expense increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  an increase of 
operating expense increased as a result of the increase in operating activity and the increase in out of pocket expense associated with reimbursable revenue  but also as a result of a higher level of maintenance activity on our aircraft and compensation costs driven by higher labor rates and additional personnel 
these additional operating expense items resulted in a decline in operating income for our north america business unit and a decline in operating margin for our north america and europe business units 
however  improved margins for most of our other business units and significant gains on asset dispositions in fiscal year compared to only a small gain on asset dispositions in fiscal year resulted in increases in our operating income and operating margin to million and  respectively  for fiscal year from million and  respectively  for fiscal year income from continuing operations for fiscal year of million represents a million increase from fiscal year this increase in income was driven by the increase in operating income discussed above  increased earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  an increase in interest income and a decrease in interest expense  which was partially offset by foreign exchange losses of million in fiscal year compared to foreign exchange gains of million in fiscal year  and an increase in the provision for income taxes due to the additional tax expense related to the turbo asset sale see business unit operating results fiscal year compared to fiscal year north america below  the increase in income during fiscal year and from an increase in the overall effective tax rate

fiscal year compared to fiscal year set forth below is a discussion of the results of operations of our business units 
our consolidated results are discussed under executive overview overview of operating results above 
north america gross revenue for north america decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  and flight activity decreased by 
the decrease in gross revenue is due to a reduction in technical services revenue of million resulting from the sale of turbo  partially offset by a favorable shift in the mix of aircraft type utilized in the us gulf of mexico in fiscal year despite an overall decrease in flight activity in the us gulf of mexico in fiscal year  revenue from flight operations were higher than fiscal year as a result of an increase in the usage of medium and large aircraft which earn higher rates 
as of march   there were small aircraft operating in the us gulf of mexico compared to small aircraft as of march  additionally  a rate increase for certain contracts contributed to the increase in revenue from flight operations in fiscal year operating expense for north america decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the decrease is due to an million reduction in operating expense attributable to the sale of turbo and an increase in maintenance cost allocations to the south and central america business unit  partially offset by higher labor costs associated with increases in salaries 
during fiscal year  wh centralized operations incurred lower maintenance costs than planned  which together with the favorable mix of aircraft utilized and the increase in rates discussed above  resulted in an increase in operating margin to for fiscal year from for fiscal year since fiscal year  we have added four new medium aircraft while disposing of small aircraft including two lease terminations 
we expect to continue disposing of our smaller aircraft in the us gulf of mexico and are currently exploring alternatives for accelerating the disposition of approximately of such aircraft within the next eighteen months 
any such aircraft dispositions will be subject to obtaining terms acceptable to us and other factors which may affect the timing or completion of the disposition 
as medium aircraft earn higher rates  we expect to continue to see the benefit from these improved rates in future years 
operating expense in fiscal year for the north america business unit includes million in retirement related expense for one of our corporate officers 
excluding this item  operating margin for fiscal year would have been 
we completed the sale of certain of the assets of turbo  our aircraft engine overhaul business  to timken alcor aerospace technologies  inc timken on november  for approximately million million of which was received in fiscal year and million of which was received in fiscal year  including post closing adjustments 
turbo represented of our consolidated gross revenue for fiscal year see discussion of this sale in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
south and central america gross revenue for south and central america increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to a increase in flight activity in trinidad resulting from the addition of aircraft in this market since fiscal year additionally  flight hours and gross revenue in mexico also increased by and  respectively 
the increases in revenue in trinidad and mexico for fiscal year was partially offset by a decrease in flight activity in brazil as six aircraft were sold during fiscal year as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  we recognize revenue on a cash basis from our owned unconsolidated affiliates in mexico  hc 
as of march   million of amounts billed but not collected from hc have not been recognized in our results  and our share of the equity in earnings of rlr has been reduced by million for amounts billed but not collected from hc 
during fiscal year  we recognized revenue of million upon receipt of payment from hc for amounts billed in fiscal year and recorded equity earnings from rlr of million related to receipt of payment by rlr from hc for amounts billed in fiscal year we have taken several actions which have improved the financial condition and profitability of hc  and we will continue to evaluate the improving results for hc to determine if and when we will change our accounting for this joint venture from the cash to accrual basis 
in march  hc was awarded a five year contract for five medium and two small helicopters by a major customer in mexico 
additionally  hc signed a three year contract to lease and operate eight medium helicopters for the comision federal de electricidad  the national power supplier of mexico 
operating expense for south and central america increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to increased expenses in trinidad and mexico resulting from the increase in flight activity in those markets 
operating expense for the south and central america business unit includes million in allocation of retirement related expense for one of our corporate officers 
operating margin for this business unit decreased to for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year  primarily resulting from fixed costs in brazil 
in march  we sold our ownership interest in a brazilian joint venture  while we continued to lease aircraft to this entity until the agreements expired in late fiscal year as discussed above  we sold six of our owned aircraft in brazil in fiscal year however  we have contracted to provide two new medium aircraft to another customer in brazil commencing in june and september  which should partially offset the reduction in business related to the sale of the prior partnership and older aircraft 
as previously discussed  hla leases two aircraft from a third party  which it leases to the former joint venture of ours in brazil 
europe gross revenue for europe increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the million increase in gross revenue for europe includes a million increase relating to foreign exchange effects for fiscal year excluding this effect  the increase in gross revenue primarily relates to a increase in flight activity which is in large part due to new aircraft added in the north sea since fiscal year additionally  revenue improved as a result of increases in monthly standing charge rates and annual rate escalations under certain of our contracts 
operating expense for europe increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year this million increase in operating expense includes a million increase relating to foreign exchange effects for fiscal year the remaining increase in operating expense is primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits resulting from the increase in activity  additions in personnel and salary increases  increases in maintenance expense resulting from the increase in activity and an increase in allocations of maintenance from eh centralized operations  other expense including third party lease costs and in reimbursable expense 
operating expense included a favorable impact from the resolution of an employee tax item resulting in a million benefit for fiscal year as a result of new aircraft added to this market at higher margins and increased rates on other contracts  our operating margin for europe increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year excluding the impact of the resolution of the employee tax item  operating margin for europe would have been in fiscal year in october  we were awarded an amendment and extension of our existing contract in the north sea with integrated aviation consortium for the provision of helicopter transportation services to offshore facilities both east and west of the shetland islands 
the amendment extended the contract until june and called for the provision of five new sikorsky s helicopters to replace six asl super puma helicopters 
in december  the provision for a sixth sikorsky s was confirmed and a related aircraft option was exercised 
the first aircraft was delivered and went into service in the second quarter of fiscal year additionally  two aircraft were delivered in the third quarter of fiscal year with the final three aircraft delivered in the fourth quarter of fiscal year of the six asl super puma helicopters displaced  four are being re deployed to southeast asia and one is being re deployed to west africa 
one support aircraft remains in aberdeen 
we previously provided search and rescue services for the mca 
the four bases under the contract were transitioned to another operator during the period from july  until april  we expect that we will either be able to employ these aircraft for other customers  trade the aircraft in as partial consideration towards the purchase of new aircraft or sell the aircraft 
we sold one of these aircraft in january in fiscal year and  we had million and million  respectively  in operating revenue associated with this contract 
west africa gross revenue for west africa increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily as a result of an increase in rates under our contracts with customers and the addition of new aircraft in nigeria 
in september  we renegotiated two different contracts with one of these customers that increased the rates and extended the terms 
one of the contracts is for helicopters and the other contract for fixed wing aircraft 
the extension period for the helicopter contract is from october through september and calls for rate increases retroactive to april  this agreement also includes an additional rate escalation effective october the agreement for the fixed wing aircraft extends from august through december and includes rate increases effective august and january in addition  a second major customer in nigeria extended its contract for helicopter services at higher rates from october through september this contract calls for a rate increase effective april for most of the equipment involved 
in november  we renegotiated a helicopter services contract with a third major customer  which expires in february and includes a rate increase retroactive to july  and rate escalations effective july and july in december  a major customer in nigeria notified us of termination of a contract effective march  under which we operated and maintained fixed wing aircraft owned by the customer 
in march  we negotiated a two year contract extension with a major customer in nigeria for two large and one medium aircraft  which is effective april  and includes a rate increase in the first year and an additional rate escalation in the second year 
operating expense for west africa increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase was primarily a result of safety and compensation related increases  including severance accruals  wage increases and additional end of service costs  increases in maintenance expense resulting from the increase in activity and an increase in allocations of maintenance from eh centralized operations  and additional costs related to training of local nigerian personnel  which were partially offset by the reversals of million in accruals for tax contingency items in fiscal year and decreases in other expenses  including freight charges and travel costs 
million of the accruals for tax contingency items reversed in fiscal year were originally accrued in fiscal year compensation related increases in fiscal year included approximately million in costs incurred to make employees of ours in nigeria redundant 
the tax contingency items reversed included million associated with sales taxes and million associated with employee taxes 
operating margin for west africa increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year  primarily as a result of the increases in rates and reversal of the accruals for tax contingency items 
excluding the reversal of the accruals for tax contingency items and the employee redundancy costs  our operating margin for fiscal year would have been 
in fiscal year  we reorganized our nigerian operations  which included increased security  consolidation of management of two operating businesses  expansion of several hangar facilities  integration of finance and administrative functions  and repositioning of major maintenance operations into our two largest operating facilities 
in fiscal year  we completed negotiations with the unions in nigeria  which resulted in a portion of the increase in salaries and benefits discussed above 
we also experience periodic disruption to our operations related to civil unrest and violence 
these factors have made and are expected to continue to make our operating results from nigeria unpredictable 
southeast asia gross revenue for southeast asia increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to higher revenue in australia and malaysia 
australia s flight activity and revenue increased and  respectively  from fiscal year  primarily due to the addition of aircraft to this market and rate increases 
malaysia s revenue increased by over as a result of the addition of four medium aircraft during fiscal year operating expense increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year as a result of an increase in salary  maintenance and fuel costs primarily driven by the increase in activity compared to fiscal year as a result of new aircraft added at higher margins and increased rates on other contracts in australia and the addition of aircraft in malaysia in fiscal year  operating margin increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year in april  we completed negotiations on the collective bargaining agreement with the pilot s union in australia  which resulted in a portion of the increase in salary cost discussed above 
other international gross revenue for other international increased marginally to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year fiscal year included increases in flight activity in egypt and india which resulted from an aircraft that was offline for maintenance for a portion of fiscal year and an additional aircraft operating in fiscal year  rate increases for our operations in russia  the operation of new aircraft in kazakhstan at higher rates than aircraft previously operating in this market and a short term contract in libya in fiscal year  while fiscal year included the billing of an escalation charge in fiscal year on contracts in both russia million in gross revenue and mauritania million in gross revenue and revenue earned under a short term contract in kenya million in gross revenue 
our most significant contract in russia expires at the end of may  and if not renewed  there could be a significant reduction in our revenue and operating income for our other international business unit in future periods 
operating expense increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in operating expense is primarily due to increased operational costs associated with the increases in flight activity in egypt and india  the performance of a short term contract in libya  increases in operating costs associated with new aircraft operating in kazakhstan  increased employee costs in russia and increased allocations of maintenance costs from eh centralized operations 
additionally  our results include million in costs related to a claim by a former agent who we terminated in connection with the internal review and million in additional expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal year related to the price paid for an acquisition in russia in a prior period classified as a intangible asset and amortized to expense 
as a result of increased costs in a number of markets  including for the former agent s claim and additional amortization costs  operating margin for other international decreased to a negative for fiscal year from a positive for fiscal year excluding the costs associated with the former agent s claim and the additional amortization costs recorded in russia  our operating margin would have been 
eh centralized operations our eh centralized operations business unit is comprised of our technical services business  other non flight services business in the eastern hemisphere eg  provision of maintenance and supply chain parts and services to other eastern hemisphere business units and division level expenses for our eastern hemisphere businesses 
gross revenue for eh centralized operations increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year as a result of increases in charges to other business units for cost allocations and part sales  partially offset by a decrease in third party technical services revenue 
operating expense increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits resulting from additional personnel  increases in costs associated with the increase in technical service operations including the costs of parts sold and a million impairment charge related to inventory utilized on s search and rescue configured aircraft 
bristow academy as discussed in part i 
item business bristow academy included elsewhere in this annual report  on april  we acquired bristow academy and formed our global training division 
in november  we expanded bristow academy through the acquisition of vortex 
for further discussion of these acquisitions  see executive overview included elsewhere in this annual report 
gross revenue and operating expense for bristow academy were million and million for fiscal year  respectively  resulting in a million loss for the fiscal year 
the results for fiscal year were impacted by depreciation on the stepped up cost basis of assets resulting from purchase price accounting for this acquisition 
we expect bristow academy to be profitable in future periods  although the primary strategic value to the company from this business is the supply of pilots for use in our global operations 
during fiscal year  approximately pilots graduated from bristow academy  and we hired pilots into our other business units who are recent graduates of bristow academy 
corporate corporate operating expense primarily represents costs of our corporate office and other general and administrative costs not allocated to our business units 
corporate operating expense increased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the increase is primarily due to a million increase in salaries and benefits associated with the addition of personnel and an overall increase in salaries and a million increase in other general and administrative costs  partially offset by a million decrease in professional fees  primarily resulting from lower costs associated with the internal review 
salaries and benefits in fiscal year include million in expenses related to a retirement agreement executed between the company and one of our corporate officers 
we incurred million in legal and professional fees related to the internal review in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year professional fees for fiscal year were further reduced by a million reversal of previously accrued settlement costs in connection with our settlement of the sec investigation see further discussion of the internal review and sec investigation in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in equity earnings from fbh of million primarily resulting from a gain recorded in the fiscal year by fbh upon loss of a medium aircraft in an accident and reduced interest expense  partially offset by a decrease in equity earnings from norsk of million primarily resulting from changes in estimates in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
we are in the process of completing a restructuring of norsk 
as discussed previously  in march  fbh was awarded a million approximately million extension to its contract to provide helicopters and support to british forces cyprus and the sovereign base areas administration until march  interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  increased to million during fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year  primarily due to additional interest expense of million associated with the senior notes issued in june and november  partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year and a million increase in interest income 
more interest was capitalized in fiscal year as a result of the increase in the amount of construction in progress related to helicopters being manufactured as discussed under liquidity and capital resources cash flows investing activities and in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the increase in interest income primarily resulted from an increase in cash on hand during fiscal year as a result of the issuance of the senior notes 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  for fiscal year was income of million compared to expense of million for fiscal year the gains in fiscal year primarily consist of million in foreign currency transaction gains  which resulted from revaluation of intercompany balances between entities whose functional currencies are the us dollar and nigerian naira and entities whose functional currency is the british pound sterling 
the expense for fiscal year primarily consists of million in foreign currency transaction losses  which primarily arose from operations performed by entities whose functional currency is the british pound sterling that were denominated in us dollars as a result of the weakening of the us dollar in that period see a discussion of foreign currency transactions in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk included elsewhere in this annual report for a discussion of how we manage these risks 
additionally  fiscal year included a million gain resulting from the sale of our investment in a brazilian joint venture in march and a charge of million for acquisition costs previously deferred in connection with an acquisition we were evaluating but determined was no longer probable 
taxes our effective income tax rates from continuing operations were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year was impacted by the reduction in the uk corporate tax rate which resulted in a million decrease in our provision for income taxes and a benefit of million associated with transactions completed during fiscal year in connection with an internal reorganization completed on march  see discussion of these items in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
additional transactions related to the reorganization completed on april  are expected to result in a charge to other comprehensive income in the first quarter of fiscal year as a result of a reduction of approximately million in deferred tax assets associated with our net pension liability  however  we do not expect these transactions to result in a material impact on net income 
excluding these items  our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year was impacted by additional tax expense of million recorded as a result of the sale of certain of the assets of turbo as discussed above 
excluding the tax recorded as a result of the turbo asset sale  our effective tax rate for fiscal year was 
during fiscal years and  we benefited from the resolution of tax contingencies of million and million  respectively 
our effective tax rate was also reduced by the permanent reinvestment outside the us of foreign earnings  upon which no us tax has been provided  and by the amount of our foreign source income and our ability to realize foreign tax credits 
discontinued operations discontinued operations for fiscal year incurred a million after tax loss compared to million income in fiscal year the loss for fiscal year is due to taxes associated with non deductible goodwill of million recorded in the provision for income taxes on discontinued operations in our consolidated income statement  as well as million in transaction expenses partially offset by the million gain on sale and million pre sale operating income 
additional details regarding discontinued operations are provided in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year set forth below is a discussion of the results of operations of our business units 
our consolidated results are discussed under executive overview overview of operating results above 
north america gross revenue for north america increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  and flight activity increased by 
this increase in gross revenue is due to a rate increase in may of which was phased in during fiscal year  an additional rate increase for certain contracts which was phased in beginning in march  and an increase in the number of aircraft on month to month contracts in fiscal year although less of an impact in fiscal year  another increase became effective in march  which was phased in during fiscal year operating expense for north america increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to increased maintenance expense largely associated with the complete refurbishment of several aircraft in fiscal year  higher labor costs associated with the increase in flight activity and from the adoption of the new equity compensation accounting standard in fiscal year  and higher fuel costs associated with both the increase in flight activity and a higher average cost per gallon which we are generally able to recover from our customers 
our operating margin for north america decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to the increase in maintenance and labor costs  and a high level of utilization of aircraft under contracts as opposed to ad hoc work which earns higher margins 
south and central america gross revenue for south and central america increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to higher revenue recognized in fiscal year upon receipt of cash from our joint venture in mexico and an increase in the number of aircraft operating in trinidad compared to fiscal year as discussed in fiscal year compared to fiscal year south and central america included elsewhere in this annual report  lease revenue from hc is recognized as collected 
as of march   million of revenue billed but not collected from hc had not been recognized in our results  and our share of the equity in earnings of rlr had been reduced by million for revenue billed but not collected from hc 
during fiscal year  we recognized revenue of million upon receipt of payment from hc for amounts billed in fiscal year and recorded equity earnings from rlr of million related to the receipt of payment by rlr from hc for amounts billed in fiscal year operating expense for south and central america increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to operating expense increases in trinidad as a result of additional aircraft in that market  which was almost fully offset by lower operating expense in other markets 
the largest of these decreases was noted in mexico  where overall flight activity had declined due to the conclusion of the pemex contract in february as a result of the increase in gross revenue while operating expense was substantially unchanged  the operating margin for this business unit increased significantly to for fiscal year from for fiscal year europe gross revenue for europe increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the million increase in gross revenue for europe includes a million increase relating to foreign exchange effects for fiscal year excluding this effect  the increase in gross revenue primarily relates to a increase in flight activity and an million increase in out of pocket expenses rebilled to our customers 
the majority of the increase in flight hours related to new contracts within the north sea and an increase in our utilization per airframe 
operating expense for europe increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the million increase in operating expense for europe includes a million increase relating to foreign exchange effects for fiscal year excluding this effect  the increase in operating expense primarily relates to an increase in activity in the north sea  increased maintenance costs  higher fuel rates  the impact of additions in personnel and salary increases  and the increase in out of pocket expenses rebilled to our customers in fiscal year compared to fiscal year as a result of the increases in maintenance costs and salaries and a higher level of utilization of aircraft under contracts as opposed to ad hoc work which earns higher margins  operating margin for europe decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year in connection with the contract with the mca  we had million and million  respectively  in operating revenue for fiscal years and for additional information relating to the contract with mca  see fiscal year compared to fiscal year europe included elsewhere in this annual report 
west africa gross revenue for west africa increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily as a result of a increase in flight activity in nigeria from fiscal year resulting from the addition of three new contracts in fiscal year  an increase in rates under our contract with a major customer in nigeria beginning october   increases in certain of our standard monthly rates for other contracts  and a million increase in out of pocket expenses rebilled to our customers 
operating expense for west africa increased to million for fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily a result of higher salary expense and maintenance costs associated with the increase in activity  increases in freight charges on spare parts  higher travel and security costs and the increase in out of pocket expenses rebilled to our customers 
operating margin for west africa increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year as a result of the increase in gross revenue 
southeast asia gross revenue for southeast asia increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to higher revenue in australia 
australia s flight activity and revenue increased and  respectively  from fiscal year  primarily due to the utilization of an additional large aircraft  increases in certain rates and the billing of contract escalations 
operating expense increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year primarily as a result of an increase in salary  maintenance and fuel costs related to the increase in activity compared to fiscal year as a result of higher gross revenue during fiscal year  operating margin increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year other international gross revenue for other international increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in flight activity in russia  the billing of escalation charges on contracts in both russia million in gross revenue and mauritania million in gross revenue  the commencement of flight operations in kenya  and additional revenue in egypt resulting from an additional large aircraft leased to our unconsolidated affiliate in that country  which commenced in december operating expense increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in operating expense is primarily due to increased operational costs associated with the increases in flight activity discussed above and increased general and administrative costs associated with higher salaries  travel expenses  and overhead cost allocations 
as a result of the increase in general and administrative costs discussed above  our operating margin for other international decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year eh centralized operations gross revenue for eh centralized operations increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year as a result of increased parts sales  increased intercompany charges to other business units for overhead costs and increased out of pocket costs rebilled to our customers in fiscal year compared to fiscal year operating expense decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to lower unrecovered maintenance costs  higher maintenance costs in fiscal year for a large aircraft that was being prepared for deployment to malaysia and lower professional fees incurred in fiscal year  partially offset by increased salaries for additional personnel and increased costs of materials 
corporate corporate operating expense increased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the increase is primarily due a million increase in salaries and benefits associated with the addition of personnel  an overall increase in salaries and the adoption of the new stock based compensation standard on april   and a million increase in other general and administrative costs associated with an increase in travel and other general office costs 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in professional fees  primarily resulting from lower costs associated with the internal review 
we incurred million in legal and professional fees related to the internal review in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year see further discussion of the internal review in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  primarily due to higher equity earnings from fbs and rlr 
the fbs improvement of million primarily resulted from lower interest charges  an increase in activity and rates for a manpower services contract  and a decrease in overhead costs compared to fiscal year the rlr improvement of million resulted from an increase in the amount of cash received from hc during fiscal year compared to fiscal year  as hc s results have improved as work lost upon completion of the pemex contract has gradually been replaced 
the increase was partially offset by a million decrease in equity earnings from norsk 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  totaled million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in interest expense  net  primarily resulted from higher interest income earned in fiscal year relative to fiscal year due to higher short term cash investment balances and returns primarily driven by the cash on hand as a result of the preferred stock offering completed in september and october 
additionally  interest expense for fiscal years and was reduced by approximately million and million  respectively  of capitalized interest 
more interest was capitalized in fiscal year as a result of the increase in the amount of construction in progress related to helicopters being manufactured as discussed under liquidity and capital resources cash flows investing activities and in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  for fiscal year was expense of million compared to income of million for fiscal year  and primarily represents foreign currency transaction losses and gains  respectively 
these gains and losses arose primarily from us dollar denominated transactions entered into by bristow aviation whose functional currency is the british pound sterling 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk included elsewhere in this annual report for a discussion of how we manage these risks 
additionally  fiscal year included a million gain resulting from the sale of our investment in a brazilian joint venture in march and a charge of million for acquisition costs previously deferred in connection with an acquisition we were evaluating as we determined that the acquisition was no longer probable 
taxes our effective income tax rates from continuing operations were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year was impacted by additional tax expense of million recorded as a result of the sale of certain of the assets of turbo as discussed above 
excluding the tax recorded as a result of the turbo asset sale  our effective tax rate for fiscal year was 
during fiscal year  we benefited from the resolution of tax contingencies of million 
our effective tax rate was also reduced by the permanent reinvestment outside the us of foreign earnings  upon which no us tax has been provided  and by the amount of our foreign source income and our ability to realize foreign tax credits 
the significant variance between the us federal statutory rate and the effective rate for fiscal year was due primarily to the resolution of tax contingencies of million during that period  as a result of our evaluation of the need for such reserves in light of the expiration of the related statutes of limitations 
discontinued operations discontinued operations for fiscal year generated million income compared to million income in fiscal year the decrease in income was the result of a significant customer of the production management services substantially reducing the scope of work under our services contract beginning in october additional details regarding discontinued operations are provided in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million  million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively 
non cash working capital used million  million and million in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by operations between fiscal years and was primarily due to cash used to fund working capital requirements in fiscal year resulting from the expansion of our business through purchases of additional aircraft and increases in flight hours from our existing aircraft fleet 
cash flows from operating activities improved during fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to the favorable change in non cash working capital  changes in deferred income taxes and the improvement in net income during fiscal year versus fiscal year investing activities cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively  primarily for capital expenditures as follows fiscal year ended march  number of aircraft delivered small medium large fixed wing training total aircraft capital expenditures in thousands aircraft and related equipment other total capital expenditures includes one aircraft in fiscal year and two aircraft in fiscal year that were not acquired through orders 
includes expenditures financed with million of short term notes during fiscal year fiscal year during fiscal year  we made final payments in connection with the delivery of aircraft  progress payments on the construction of new aircraft to be delivered in future periods in conjunction with our aircraft commitments  and purchased one fixed wing aircraft  for a total of million 
also during fiscal year  we spent an additional million to upgrade aircraft within our existing aircraft fleet and to customize new aircraft delivered for our operations 
during fiscal year  we received proceeds of million from the disposal of aircraft and certain other equipment  resulting in a gain of million 
included in the million gain is a total loss on one medium aircraft from a crash in nigeria  a total loss on two small aircraft in the gulf of mexico in flight accidents and a total loss from storm damage to one medium aircraft  resulting in a net loss on asset disposals of million 
all of these losses were insured 
additionally  in fiscal year  we settled an insurance claim on an aircraft that was damaged in the north sea in november  which resulted in a gain of million 
the proceeds from this claim totaling million were received in may the proceeds are presented in non cash investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal year as discussed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  during fiscal year we acquired all of the common equity of hai for million in cash 
we also assumed million in debt as part of this transaction which was repaid during fiscal year additionally  we acquired vortex for million in november we contributed capital of approximately million to rlr  and we loaned rlr million under a three year term loan arrangement  the funds of which were used by rlr towards the purchase of a medium sized aircraft 
as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  on november   we sold grasso for approximately million  subject to post closing adjustments  including million received in fiscal year due to the significant investment in aircraft made in fiscal years  and  net capital expenditures exceeded cash flow from operations  and we expect this will continue to be the case in fiscal year also  in fiscal year  we expect to invest approximately million in various infrastructure enhancements  including aircraft facilities  training centers and technology 
fiscal year during fiscal year  we made final payments in connection with the delivery of aircraft and progress payments on the construction of new aircraft to be delivered in future periods in conjunction with our aircraft commitments totaling million 
also during fiscal year  we spent an additional million to upgrade aircraft within our existing aircraft fleet and to customize new aircraft delivered for our operations 
as discussed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  during fiscal year  we received proceeds of million out of a total sales price of million for the sale of certain of the assets of turbo to timken  which closed on november  and resulted in a small gain for book purposes 
we received the remaining million due to us late in fiscal year additionally  we received proceeds of million  primarily from the disposal of aircraft and certain other equipment  which together resulted in a net gain of million 
fiscal year during fiscal year  we received proceeds of million primarily from the disposal of one aircraft and certain equipment  and from insurance recoveries associated with hurricane katrina damage  which together resulted in a net gain of million 
additionally  on december   we sold nine aircraft for million in aggregate to a subsidiary of general electric capital corporation  and then leased back each of the nine aircraft under separate operating leases with terms of ten years expiring in january see discussion of this arrangement in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
financing activities cash flows used by financing activities were million in fiscal year while cash flows provided by financing activities were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
during fiscal year  cash was provided by issuance of senior notes completed in june and november resulting in net proceeds of million and by our receipt of proceeds of million from the exercise of options to acquire shares of our common stock primarily by our employees 
cash was used for the payment of preferred stock dividends of million and the repayment of debt totaling million 
during fiscal year  cash was provided by the issuance of preferred stock in september and october resulting in net proceeds of million and by our receipt of proceeds of million from the exercise of options to acquire shares of our common stock by our employees and former directors 
cash was used for the payment of preferred stock dividends of million and the repayment of debt totaling million 
during fiscal year  cash was used for the repayment of debt totaling million and was partially provided by our receipt of proceeds of million from the exercise of options to acquire shares of our common stock by our employees 
see further discussion of outstanding debt as of march  and our debt issuances and redemptions in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
preferred stock annual cumulative cash dividends of per share of preferred stock are payable quarterly on the fifteenth day of each march  june  september and december 
if declared  dividends on the  shares of preferred stock would be million on each quarterly payment date through the conversion date on september  for further discussion of the terms and conditions of the preferred stock  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
future cash requirements debt obligations total debt as of march  was million  of which million was classified as current 
our significant debt maturities relate to our million of senior notes and million of senior notes  which mature in and  respectively 
see further discussion of outstanding debt as of march  and our debt issuances and our debt redemptions in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
other obligations pension plan as of march   we had recorded on our balance sheet a million pension liability related to the bristow helicopters group limited bristow helicopters  a wholly owned subsidiary of bristow aviation pension plan 
the liability represents the excess of the present value of the defined benefit pension plan liabilities over the fair value of plan assets that existed at that date 
the minimum funding rules of the uk require us to make scheduled contributions in amounts sufficient to bring the plan up to funded as defined by uk legislation within three years and funded within years 
in order to meet our funding requirements  we increased the contributions to the schemes to million million per year beginning in fiscal year and continuing in fiscal year nevertheless  regulatory agencies in the uk may require us to further increase the contributions 
contractual obligations  commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments  interest payments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the table below 
for example  we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 
the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments on an undiscounted basis as of march  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report payments due by period fiscal year ending march  total and beyond other in thousands contractual obligations long term debt and short term borrowings principal interest aircraft operating leases other operating leases pension obligations aircraft purchase obligations other purchase obligations tax reserves total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments debt guarantees other guarantees letters of credit total commercial commitments excludes unamortized premium on the senior notes of million 
represents primarily separate operating leases for nine aircraft with a subsidiary of general electric capital corporation with terms of ten years expiring in january represents minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year 
represents expected funding for pension benefits in future periods 
these amounts are undiscounted and are based on the expectation that the pension will be fully funded in approximately years 
as of march   we had recorded on our balance sheet a million pension liability associated with this obligation 
also  the timing of the funding is dependent on actuarial valuations and resulting negotiations with the plan trustees 
for further details on our aircraft purchase obligations  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
other purchase obligations primarily represent unfilled purchase orders for aircraft parts  commitments associated with upgrading facilities at our bases and amounts committed under a supply agreement see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
represents gross unrecognized benefits in connection with the adoption of fin see discussion under exposure to currency fluctuations critical accounting policies and estimates taxes included elsewhere in this annual report that may result in cash payments being made to certain tax authorities 
we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods this amount will ultimately be settled and paid 
we have guaranteed the repayment of up to million million of the debt of fbs and million of the debt of rlr  both unconsolidated affiliates 
additionally  the lender has an option to put to us the remaining amount of the rlr debt of million  which we have guaranteed in the event of default of the other rlr shareholder 
this amount is not included in the table above 
relates to an indemnity agreement between us and afianzadora sofimex  sa to support issuance of surety bonds on behalf of hc from time to time 
as of march   surety bonds denominated in mexican pesos with an aggregate value of million mexican pesos million and a surety bond denominated in us dollars with a value of million were outstanding 
we do not expect the guarantees shown in the table above to become obligations that we will have to fund 
financial condition and sources of liquidity our future cash requirements include the contractual obligations discussed in the previous section and our normal operations 
normally our operating cash flows are sufficient to fund our cash needs 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that our existing cash  future cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under the million revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future based on existing commitments 
however  the expansion of our business through purchases of additional aircraft and increases in flight hours from our existing aircraft fleet may require additional cash in the future to fund new aircraft purchases and working capital requirements 
consistent with our desire to maintain a conservative use of leverage to fund growth  we raised capital through the sale of the preferred stock in september and october additionally  we raised million through the sale of the senior notes completed in june and november as of march   we had options to acquire an additional large aircraft and an additional medium aircraft 
depending on market conditions  we expect to exercise some or all of these additional options to acquire aircraft and purchase other aircraft  and we may elect to expand our business through acquisition  including acquisitions under consideration or negotiation 
cash on hand  cash flow from operations and available capacity under the revolving credit facility are estimated to provide sufficient capital to exercise a portion of the aircraft purchase options or allow us to complete several small acquisitions under million over the next five years 
however  our ability to exercise the remainder of our aircraft purchase options  make a major acquisition or purchase substantially more aircraft would likely require us to raise additional capital 
see item a 
risk factors in order to grow our business  we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available to us included elsewhere in this annual report 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million  as of march  and  respectively 
working capital as of march  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital during fiscal year was primarily a result of the million increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the sale of the senior notes completed in june and november and cash generated from operations  partially offset by capital expenditures primarily for aircraft 
exposure to currency fluctuations see our discussion of the impact of market risk  including our exposure to currency fluctuations  on our financial position and results of operations discussed under item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  professional advice and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure 
taxes our annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the determination and evaluation of our annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements  and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction would impact our tax liability in any given year 
we also operate in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the offshore oilfield service industry are not well developed 
while our annual tax provision is based on the best information available at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions are determined 
we recognize foreign tax credits available to us to offset the us income taxes due on income earned from foreign sources 
these credits are limited by the total income tax on the us income tax return as well as by the ratio of foreign source income in each statutory category to total income 
in estimating the amount of foreign tax credits that are realizable  we estimate future taxable income in each statutory category 
these estimates are subject to change based on changes in the market conditions in each statutory category and the timing of certain deductions available to us in each statutory category 
we periodically reassess these estimates and record changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits based on these revised estimates 
changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits can be significant given any material change to our estimates on which the realizability of foreign tax credits is based 
we maintain reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation  including reserves for income  value added  sales and payroll taxes 
the expenses reported for these taxes  including our annual tax provision  include the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing  disposition transactions and the applicability or rate of various withholding taxes 
these exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause us to conclude that a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
we believe that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures 
however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we review these liabilities quarterly 
during fiscal years  and  we had net reversals of reserves for estimated income tax exposures of million  million and million  respectively 
these reversals were made in the periods in which the statute of limitations for the related exposures expired 
we do not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential effect of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide and the potential exists that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amounts accrued 
judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is estimated to be more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carry forwards  will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are estimated to not be realizable 
as of march   our valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets  primarily us foreign tax credit carry forwards was million 
we decreased the valuation allowance as of march  to million 
if our facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine changes to the amount of the valuation allowance in any given period 
such changes could result in either a decrease or an increase in our provision for income taxes  depending on whether the change in judgment resulted in an increase or a decrease to the valuation allowance 
we continually evaluate strategies that could allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets 
we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as of march  that are indefinitely reinvested abroad of million 
should we make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
at the current time  a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practical 
as discussed in notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  in april we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
fin requires a new evaluation process for all tax positions taken  recognizing tax benefits when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the authorities 
the benefit from a position that has surpassed the more likely than not threshold is the largest amount of benefit that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
as of the april  date of adoption of fin and march   we had million and million  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits  all of which would have an impact on our effective tax rate  if recognized 
we have not provided for deferred taxes in circumstances where we expect that  due to the structure of operations and applicable law  the operations in such jurisdictions will not give rise to future tax consequences 
should our expectations change regarding the expected future tax consequences  we may be required to record additional deferred taxes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
property and equipment our net property and equipment represents percent of our total assets as of march  we determine the carrying value of these assets based on our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate our estimates  assumptions  and judgments relative to capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
our property and equipment accounting policies are also designed to depreciate our assets over their estimated useful lives 
the assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives and residual values of our aircraft reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance of our assets 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of property and equipment accounting policies  especially those involving the useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  would likely result in materially different net book values of our assets and results of operations 
useful lives of aircraft and residual values are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including changes in operating conditions or environment  the introduction of technological advances in aviation equipment  changes in market or economic conditions including changes in demand for certain types of aircraft and changes in laws or regulations affecting the aviation or offshore oil and gas industry 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our aircraft when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the aircraft 
we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may be impaired or when reclassifications are made between property and equipment and assets held for sale 
asset impairment evaluations are based on estimated undiscounted cash flows for the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such event  we would then be required to record a corresponding charge  which would reduce our earnings 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and assumptions and believe that our assumptions  which include an estimate of future cash flows based upon the anticipated performance of the underlying business units  are appropriate 
supply and demand are the key drivers of aircraft idle time and our ability to contract our aircraft at economical rates 
during periods of oversupply  it is not uncommon for us to have aircraft idled for extended periods of time  which could be an indication that an asset group may be impaired 
in most instances our aircraft could be used interchangeably 
in addition  our aircraft are generally equipped to operate throughout the world 
because our aircraft are mobile  we may move aircraft from a weak geographic market to a stronger geographic market if an adequate opportunity arises to do so 
as such  our aircraft are considered to be interchangeable within classes or asset groups and accordingly  our impairment evaluation is made by asset group 
additionally  our management periodically makes strategic decisions related to our fleet that involve the possible removal of all or a substantial portion of specific aircraft types from our fleet  at which time these aircraft are reclassified to held for sale and subsequently sold or otherwise disposed of 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount of assets within an asset group is not recoverable 
this requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenue and cost related to the assets subject to review 
in turn  these forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific asset groups and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
revenue recognition in general  we recognize revenue when it is both realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when the following conditions exist the persuasive evidence of an arrangement  generally a customer contract  the services or products have been performed or delivered to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable within the contract  and collection is probable 
more specifically  revenue from helicopter services is recognized based on contractual rates as the related services are performed 
the charges under these contracts are generally based on a two tier rate structure consisting of a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
these contracts are for varying periods and generally permit the customer to cancel the contract before the end of the term 
we also provide services to customers on an ad hoc basis  which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter duration 
our charges for ad hoc services are generally based on an hourly rate or a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
we estimate that our ad hoc services have a higher margin than other helicopter contracts 
in order to offset potential increases in operating costs  our long term contracts may provide for periodic increases in the contractual rates charged for our services 
we recognize the impact of these rate increases when the criteria outlined above have been met 
this generally includes written recognition from our customers that they are in agreement with the amount of the rate escalation 
in addition  our standard rate structure is based on fuel costs remaining at or below a predetermined threshold 
fuel costs in excess of this threshold are generally reimbursed by the customer 
cost reimbursements from customers are recorded as reimbursable revenue in our consolidated statement of income 
pension benefits pension obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates  compensation increases and employee turnover rates 
we evaluate our assumptions periodically and make adjustments to these assumptions and the recorded liabilities as necessary 
three of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the assumed discount rate and the mortality rate 
we evaluate our assumptions regarding the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience and future expectations on investment returns  which are calculated by our third party investment advisor utilizing the asset allocation classes held by the plan s portfolios 
we utilize a british pound sterling denominated aa corporate bond index as a basis for determining the discount rate for our uk plans 
we base mortality rates utilized on actuarial research on these rates  which are adjusted to allow for expected mortality within our industry segment 
changes in these and other assumptions used in the actuarial computations could impact our projected benefit obligations  pension liabilities  pension expense and other comprehensive income 
we base our determination of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets that reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over the average remaining lifetime of the plan members 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish reserves for doubtful accounts on a case by case basis when we believe the payment of amounts owed to us is unlikely to occur 
in establishing these reserves  we consider our historical experience  changes in our customer s financial position  restrictions placed on the conversion of local currency to us dollars  as well as disputes with customers regarding the application of contract provisions to our services 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from services to international oil companies and government owned or government controlled oil companies 
our receivables are concentrated in certain oil producing countries 
we generally do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables 
if the financial condition of our clients was to deteriorate or their access to freely convertible currency was restricted  resulting in impairment of their ability to make the required payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory reserve we maintain inventory that primarily consists of spare parts to service our aircraft 
we periodically review the condition and continuing usefulness of the parts to determine whether the realizable value of this inventory is lower than its book value 
parts related to aircraft types that our management has determined will no longer be included in our fleet or will be substantially reduced in our fleet in future periods are specifically reviewed 
if our valuation of these parts is significantly lower than the book value of the parts  an additional provision may be required 
insurance we are self insured for our group medical insurance plans in the us in addition  we have several medical plans covering certain non us employee groups 
we must make estimates to record the expenses related to these plans 
we also have workers compensation programs in the us for work related injuries 
in addition  we have insurance for work related injuries covering certain non us employee groups 
we estimate the expenses related to the retained portion of that risk 
if actual experience under any of our insurance plans is greater than our original estimates  we may have to record charges to income when we identify the risk of additional loss 
conversely  if actual costs are lower than our estimates or return premiums are larger than originally projected  we may have to record credits to income 
contingent liabilities we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to potential tax assessments  litigation  personal injury claims and environmental liabilities 
income for each reporting period includes revisions to contingent liability reserves resulting from different facts or information which becomes known or circumstances which change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
such revisions are based on information which becomes known after the reporting date for the previous period through the reporting date of the current period 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated reserves  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required to be recognized 
goodwill impairment we perform a test for impairment of our goodwill annually as of march because our business is cyclical in nature  goodwill could be significantly impaired depending on when the assessment is performed in the business cycle 
the fair value of our reporting units is based on a blend of estimated discounted cash flows  publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples 
estimated discounted cash flows are based on projected flight hours and rates 
publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples are derived from information on traded shares and analysis of recent acquisitions in the marketplace  respectively  for companies with operations similar to ours 
changes in the assumptions used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value  which may give rise to an impairment of goodwill 
in addition to the annual review  we also test for impairment should an event occur or circumstances change that may indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
stock based compensation we have historically compensated our directors  executives and certain employees by awarding stock based compensation  including stock options and restricted stock units 
we use a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based awards 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions  including the risk free interest rate  volatility  dividend yield and the expected term of the options  in order to determine the fair value of the options on the date of grant 
judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
additionally  the service period over which compensation expense associated with awards of restricted stock units are recorded in our consolidated statements of income involve certain assumptions as to the expected vesting of the restricted stock units  which is based on factors relating to the future performance of our stock 
as the determination of these various assumptions is subject to significant management judgment and different assumptions could result in material differences in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements  management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of stock options and the service period for restricted stock units are critical estimates 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period equal to the expected term of the option 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of shares of our common stock  which has not been adjusted for any expectation of future volatility given uncertainty related to the future performance of our common stock at this time 
we also use historical data to estimate the expected term of the options within the option pricing model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the expected term of the options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
this risk arises primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  credit risk  and interest rates as discussed below 
foreign currency risk through our foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks 
the majority of our revenue and expense from our north sea operations are in british pound sterling 
approximately of our gross revenue for fiscal year was translated for financial reporting purposes from british pound sterling into us dollars 
in addition  some of our contracts to provide services internationally provide for payment in foreign currencies  such as australian dollars  euros  nigerian naira  and trinidad and tobago dollars 
our foreign exchange rate risk is even greater when our revenue is denominated in a currency different from the associated costs 
we attempt to minimize our foreign exchange rate exposure by contracting the majority of our services other than our north sea operations in us dollars 
as a result  a strong us dollar may increase the local cost of our services that are provided under us dollar denominated contracts  which may reduce the demand for our services in foreign countries 
except as described below  we do not enter into hedging transactions to protect against foreign exchange risks related to our gross revenue 
we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the us dollar and between other foreign currencies and the us dollar because we maintain our financial statements in us dollars 
in preparing our financial statements  we must convert all non us dollar currencies to non us dollars 
balance sheet information is presented based on the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date  and income statement information is presented based on the average conversion rate for the period 
the various components of stockholders investment are presented at their historical average exchange rates 
the resulting difference after applying the different exchange rates is the cumulative translation adjustment 
foreign currency translation gains and losses result from the effect of changes in exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than a company s functional currency  including transactions between consolidated companies 
an exception is made where an intercompany loan or advance is deemed to be of a long term investment nature  in which instance foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included with cumulative translation gains and losses and are reported in stockholders investment as accumulated other comprehensive gains or losses 
in the past three fiscal years our stockholders investment has increased by million as a result of translation adjustments 
changes in exchange rates could cause significant changes in our financial position and results of operations in the future 
as a result of the changes in exchange rates during fiscal years and  we recorded foreign currency transaction gains of approximately million and million  respectively  primarily related to the british pound sterling  compared to foreign currency transaction losses of approximately million during fiscal year the significant gains and losses in fiscal years and arose primarily from the following us dollar denominated transactions entered into by bristow aviation whose functional currency is the british pound sterling cash and cash equivalents held in us dollar denominated accounts 
beginning in july  we reduced a portion of bristow aviation s us dollar denominated cash balances 
us dollar denominated intercompany loans and us dollar denominated receivables 
on august   we entered into a derivative contract to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on our us dollar denominated intercompany loans 
this derivative contract provided us with a call option on million and a put option on million  with a strike price of us dollars per british pound sterling  and was exercised by us prior to the scheduled expiration on november   resulting in a net loss of million 
on november   we entered into another derivative contract for the same amount and strike price that expired on may   resulting in a cumulative gain of million  of which million related to fiscal year and is included in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of income 
on april   primarily as a result of changes in the manner in which certain of our consolidated subsidiaries create and manage intercompany balances  we changed the functional currency of two of our consolidated subsidiaries  bristow helicopters international ltd 
and caledonia helicopters ltd  from the british pound sterling to the us dollar  which reduced our exposure to us dollar denominated intercompany loans and advances 
the changes we made to the manner in which we manage intercompany balances for these two entities has simplified our business as it allows for a clearer view of sales and purchases required to run these businesses and assists in resource management 
euro and nigerian naira denominated intercompany loans 
the economic effect of the foreign currency transaction losses during fiscal year was offset by a corresponding benefit during those periods reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment in stockholders investment on our consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  in april we significantly reduced our euro denominated intercompany loans  thereby reducing our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates for this foreign currency 
the following table presents the applicable exchange rates of one british pound sterling into us dollars for the indicated periods fiscal year ended march  high average low as of march   and the exchange rate was  and  respectively 
in addition  certain of our contractual commitments  including aircraft purchase commitments  are payable in currencies other than the us dollar  which exposes us to cash flow risk during periods when the us dollar weakens against those currencies 
during fiscal year  the us dollar has weakened substantially against the euro exposing us to significant cash flow risk related to euro denominated aircraft purchase commitments 
the exchange rate of one euro into us dollars as of march  and was and  respectively 
in fiscal year  we entered into forward contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on our euro denominated aircraft purchase commitments  which have been designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
as of march   the fair value of the forward contracts was an asset of million 
as of march   an unrecognized gain of million  net of tax  on the open foreign currency forward contracts is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and a derivative asset of million is included in prepaid expenses and other million and other assets million in our consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  we occasionally use off balance sheet hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our operating activities conducted in foreign currencies 
as of march   we did not have any nominal forward exchange contracts outstanding to hedge our operating activities 
a hypothetical decrease in the value of the foreign currencies in which our business is denominated relative to the us dollar as of march  would result in an million decrease in the fair value of our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
credit risk the market for our services and products is primarily the offshore oil and gas industry  and our customers consist primarily of major integrated international oil companies and independent oil and gas producers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and have not historically required material collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses  and such losses have been within management s expectations 
cash equivalents  which consist of funds invested in highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of days or less  are held by major banks or investment firms  and we believe that credit risk in these instruments is minimal 
we also manage our credit risk by not entering into complex financial transactions or those with a perceived high level of credit risk 
interest rate risk as of march   we have million of debt outstanding  million of which carries a variable rate of interest 
however  the market value of our fixed rate debt fluctuates with changes in interest rates 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices or prices quoted from third party financial institutions 
the estimated fair value of our total debt as of march  and was million and million  respectively  based on quoted market prices for the publicly listed senior notes  senior notes and the carrying value for all of our other debt  which approximates fair value 
if prevailing market interest rates had been higher as of march   and all other factors effecting our debt remained the same  the fair value of the senior notes and the senior notes would have decreased by million or 
under comparable sensitivity analysis as of march   the fair value of the senior notes would have decreased by million or
