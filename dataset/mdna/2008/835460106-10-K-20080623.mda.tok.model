item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k  we recently performed a voluntary review of our historical stock option grant practices and related accounting 
based on the results of the review  we restated our historical financial statements 
as discussed in note contingencies  commitments and credit facilities litigation matters to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  various shareholder derivative lawsuits and putative class actions have been filed against us  our current directors and officers and certain of our former directors and officers relating to our historical stock option practices and related accounting 
we may become the subject of additional private or government actions regarding these matters in the future 
these actions are in the preliminary stages  and their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and the price for our common stock 
litigation may be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to normal business operations  and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict 
the defense of these lawsuits will result in significant expenditures and the continued diversion of our management s time and attention from the operation of our business  which could impede our business 
all or a portion of any amount we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment or settlement of any or all of these claims may also not be covered by insurance 
as a result of review of our historical stock option granting practices and related restatements  we could be investigated by the sec  the department of justice  the irs or other governmental authority 
it is possible that the sec  department of justice doj  the irs or other governmental authority could initiate an investigation in connection with our historical stock option practices and related accounting 
the period of time necessary to resolve any governmental investigations would be uncertain  and could require significant management and financial resources that could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business  as well as considerable legal and accounting expenses 
if any governmental investigation resulted in an adverse finding against us or any of our current or former officers or directors  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us that could adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial position  cash flows and the market price of our common stock 
we may experience potential fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  face unpredictability of future revenue and incur losses in the future 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid changes in technology 
we may not accurately predict customer or business partner behavior and may not recognize or respond to emerging trends  changing 
table of contents preferences or competitive factors  and  therefore  we may fail to make accurate financial forecasts 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include fluctuations in demand for  and sales of  our products and the pcs and ce devices that include our products  introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors  competitive pressures that result in pricing fluctuations  variations in the timing of orders and shipments of our products  changes in the mix of products and services we sell and the impact on our gross margins  delays in our receipt of or cancellation of orders forecasted or placed by customers  our ability to enter into or renew on favorable terms our licensing  distribution and other agreements  costs associated with the defense or prosecution of  or adverse judgment arising from  litigation and intellectual property claims  and economic conditions specific to the audio and video recording market  as well as to the related pc and ce markets 
our operating expenses are based on our current expectations of our future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
we tend to generate a significant portion of quarterly revenues in the last month or last weeks of a quarter  and we generally do not know until quite late in a quarter whether we will achieve our sales expectations for the quarter 
for our oem licenses  we recognize revenues upon receipt of a royalty report from those oems 
oem royalty reports are sometimes incomplete  or are received on an unpredictable schedule 
in some cases we determine that we need to perform additional review of reports prior to including the underlying royalties in revenues 
therefore  depending on the timing of receipt of royalty reports relative to quarterly cut offs  our reported revenues may fluctuate and  in some cases  our reported operating results may be negatively impacted 
if we have lower revenues than we expect  we may not be able to quickly reduce our spending in response 
from time to time  we also may make certain pricing  service or marketing decisions that adversely affect our revenues in a given quarterly or annual period 
any shortfall in our revenues would have a direct impact on our operating results for a particular quarter and this could affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
we need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to remain competitive 
the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and relatively short product lives 
the pursuit of necessary technological advances and the development of new products require substantial time and expense 
to compete successfully in the markets in which we operate  we must develop and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability 
for example  our business involves digital audio and video formats  such as dvd video and dvd audio  and  more recently  recordable dvd formats including dvd ram  dvd r rw  and dvd rw 
currently  there is extensive activity in our industry targeting the introduction and adoption of new  high definition  formats  including bd 
to the extent that competing new formats remain incompatible  consumer adoption may be delayed and we may be required to expend additional resources to support multiple formats 
we expend significant time and effort to develop new products in compliance with these new formats 
to the extent there is a delay in the implementation or adoption of these formats  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
as a further example  we have expended significant time and effort to adapt certain of our products to be compatible with microsoft s windows vista operating system 
as new industry standards  technologies and formats are introduced  there may be limited sources for the intellectual property rights and background technologies necessary for implementation  and the initial prices that we may negotiate in an effort to bring our products to market may prove to be higher than those ultimately offered to other licensees  putting us at a competitive disadvantage 
additionally  if new formats and technologies prove to be unsuccessful or are not 
table of contents accepted for any reason  there may be limited demand for our products 
we cannot assure you that the products we are currently developing or intend to develop will achieve feasibility or that even if we are successful  the developed product will be accepted by the market 
we may not be able to recover the costs of existing and future product development and our failure to do so may materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are required to repay our credit facility in full  our liquidity and our ability to capitalize on potential business opportunities could be adversely affected 
our loan and security agreement as amended to date  the amended credit facility with union bank of california uboc expires on june  as of march   the outstanding balance on the amended credit facility was million and was classified as a current liability 
as of june   uboc has not notified us of any intent to take the actions necessary to accelerate the repayment of our obligations under the amended credit facility 
however  uboc has notified us that the terms of a renewal of a credit facility are likely to be more restrictive than our current agreement 
we are currently evaluating our options for either negotiating an additional extension of the term of the current facility or securing a new facility 
if we are unable to secure an extension of the term of the current facility with uboc  we will repay the balance from our existing cash balances and will seek to secure a new facility 
at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
if we use such cash balances to repay the facility  our liquidity may be adversely affected and we may not have sufficient cash available or to capitalize on potential business opportunities  including acquisitions 
we rely on distributors  resellers and retailers to sell our products  and disruptions to these channels would affect adversely our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 
the portion of our revenue derived from sales of software to end users via retail channels through our network of national and international distributors and resellers has increased during recent years  and we anticipate that this trend will continue 
there are currently two distributors that account for a significant portion of sales of our consumer software 
any decrease in revenue from these distributors or the loss of one of these distributors and our inability to find a satisfactory replacement in a timely manner could affect our operating results adversely 
moreover  our failure to maintain favorable arrangements with our distributors and resellers may adversely impact our business 
for example  our distributors and resellers and the retailers who sell our software to the public also sell products offered by our competitors 
if our competitors offer our distributors  resellers or retailers more favorable terms  those distributors  resellers or retailers may de emphasize  fail to recommend or decline to carry our products 
in the future  we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified distributors  resellers or retailers 
if our distributors  resellers or retailers attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand  our sales could be impacted negatively 
further  if we reduce the prices of our products  we may have to compensate our distributors  resellers or retailers for the difference between the higher price they paid to buy their inventory and the new lower prices of our products 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk of product returns from distributors  resellers or retailers through their exercise of contractual return rights 
if direct sales to customers through our own web based channels increase  our distributors  resellers and retailers may suffer decreased sales as a consequence 
these changes may cause our distributors  resellers or retailers to cease distribution of our products or seek more favorable terms  either of which could seriously harm our business 
because our products are designed to comply with industry standards  to the extent that we cannot distinguish our products from those produced by our competitors  our current distributors and customers may choose alternate products or choose to purchase products from multiple vendors 
we may be unable to compete effectively if we cannot produce products more quickly or at lower cost than our competitors 
we cannot provide any assurance that the industry standards on which we develop new products will allow us to compete effectively with companies possessing greater financial and technological resources than we have to market  promote and exploit sales opportunities as they arise in the future 
products that are designed to comply with standards may be viewed as interchangeable commodities by our customers 
additionally  accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require significant expenditures for research and development that could affect adversely our operating results 
further  any new products we 
table of contents develop may not be introduced in a timely manner or in advance of our competitors products and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues 
our business depends increasingly on sales of consumer products  which subject us to risks relating to  among other things  changing consumer demands and increased competition 
we anticipate that our business will depend increasingly on sales of consumer products to generate additional revenue and grow our business  and that we will be subject to risks due to changing consumer demands  extensive competition that may result in price erosion  product liability litigation and or product warranty concerns 
success in our consumer segment depends upon our ability to enhance and distinguish our existing products  introduce new competitive products with features that meet changing consumer requirements  and control our inventory levels  to minimize impact of sudden price decreases 
moreover  our success depends on our ability to effectively sell our products in the consumer market 
we sell our consumer products through bundling arrangements with our oem customers  through direct channels for example  our web store  as well as through retail both physical and web based channels 
we may not have the capital required or the necessary personnel or expertise to develop and enhance these distribution channels 
if we do spend the capital required to develop and maintain these distribution channels  we cannot guarantee that we will be successful or profitable 
additionally  some of our non oem revenue opportunities are fragmented and take more time and effort to establish and maintain 
also  some of our competitors have well established retail distribution capabilities and existing brands with market acceptance that provide them with a significant competitive advantage 
if we are not successful in overcoming these challenges our business and results of operations may be harmed 
because a large portion of our net revenue is from oem customers  the potential success of our products is tied to the success of their product sales 
a substantial portion of our consumer revenue is derived from sales through oem customers who bundle copies of our software with their products 
temporary fluctuations in the pricing and availability of the oem customers products could negatively impact sales of our products  which could in turn harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  increased sales of our consumer products to oems depend in large part on consumer acceptance and purchase of dvd players  dvd recorders and other digital media devices marketed by our oem customers in pcs  ce devices  or on a stand alone basis 
consumer acceptance of these digital media devices depends significantly on the price and ease of use of these devices  among other factors 
if alternative technology emerges or if the demand for moving  managing and storing digital content is less than expected  this market may decline  which may adversely affect sales of our consumer products to our oem customers 
in addition  some of the materials  components and or software included in the end products sold by our oem customers  who also incorporate our products  are obtained from a limited group of suppliers 
supply disruptions  shortages  quality issues or termination of any of these sources could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to the delay or discontinuance of orders for our products by our oem customers until those necessary materials  components or software are available for their own products 
moreover  if oem customers do not ship as many units as forecasted or if there is a general decrease in their unit sales  our net revenue will generally be impacted adversely and we may be less profitable than forecasted 
furthermore  we rely on reports prepared by oem customers to determine the results of our sales of products through these oem customers 
if the oem customers prepare inaccurate or substandard sales reports  we may be required to take corrective actions  including auditing current and prior reports 
the results of any such audits could result in lower reported net revenue and related results than previously reported 
such corrective actions may result in a negative impact on our business or our reported results 
changes in requirements or business models of our oem customers may affect negatively our financial results 
oem customers can be quite demanding with respect to the features they demand in software products they bundle  quality and testing requirements  and economic terms 
because there are a relatively small number of significant oem customers  if they demand reduced prices for our products  we may not be in a 
table of contents position to refuse such demands  which could impact negatively our revenues and results of operations 
if particular oems demand certain products or product features that we are unable to deliver  or if they impose higher quality requirements than we are able to satisfy  we could lose those relationships  which likely would damage our revenues and our results of operations 
also  if our competitors offer our oem customers more favorable terms than we do or if our competitors are able to take advantage of their existing relationships with these oems  then these oems may not include our software with their products 
our oem relationships serve an important role in distributing our software to end users and positioning the market for upgrades to our more fully featured software products 
our business will suffer if we are unable to maintain or expand our relationships with oems 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue  and the loss of one or more of these customers could materially harm our operating results  business and financial condition 
during the fiscal year ended march   approximately and of our revenue was derived from revenue recognized on licensing agreements with dell and hewlett packard  respectively  and approximately and of our revenue for fiscal was derived from revenue recognized on retail agreements from two national and international distributors  ingram and navarre  respectively 
in addition  during our fiscal  approximately of our revenue was derived from revenue recognized on our reseller agreement with digital river 
on various occasions  dell has made changes to its website that have reduced the rates at which dell customers have purchased upgraded versions of our software 
in such instances  we have worked cooperatively with dell to increase our upgrade rates and to compensate us for losses in revenues based on such dell website changes 
while we believe that we have successfully negotiated appropriate terms with dell to address these factors  there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully insulate ourselves from dell corporate website decisions  which could affect adversely sales of our consumer products to dell customers 
we anticipate that the relationships with dell  hewlett packard  ingram  navarre and digital river will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future 
any changes in our relationships with any of these customers  including any actual or alleged breach of the agreements by either party or the early termination of  or any other material change in  any of the agreements could seriously harm our operating results  business  and financial condition 
additionally  a decrease or interruption in any of the above mentioned businesses or their demand for our products or a delay in our development agreements with any one of them could cause a significant decrease in our revenue 
also  we may not succeed in attracting new customers  as many of our potential customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors 
to attract new customers  we may be required to engage in intense price competition  which may affect our gross margins 
our web store makes us vulnerable to third party operational problems and other risks 
we currently make our products available through web based retail sites in north america  europe  and japan 
these web based retail sites are operated by third party resellers 
under these arrangements  our reseller partners typically utilize co branded sites  provide the infrastructure to handle purchase transactions through their secure web sites  and deliver the product whether via web download or physical fulfillment 
we sometimes refer to such organizations as outsourcers 
our web store operations are subject to numerous risks  including unanticipated operating problems  reliance on third party computer hardware and software providers  system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems  diversion of sales from other channels  rapid technological change  liability for online content  credit card fraud  and issues relating to the use and protection of customer information 
we rely on our outsourcers for smooth operation of our web store 
since our web store sales constituted approximately of our revenue in fiscal year  any interruption of an outsourcer s service to us could have a negative effect on our business 
if our outsourcers were to withdraw from this business or change their terms of service in ways that were unfavorable to us  there might not be a ready alternative outsourcing organization available to us  and we might be unprepared to assume operation of the web store ourselves 
if any of these events occurs  our results of operations would be harmed 

table of contents changes in our product and service offerings could cause us to defer the recognition of revenue  which could harm our operating results and adversely impact our ability to forecast revenue 
our products contain advanced features and functionality that may require us to provide increased levels of end user support 
as our products and services become more complex  we may also be obligated to provide additional support to our customers  which could require us to defer certain revenues to future periods  harm our short term operating results and adversely impact our ability to accurately forecast revenue 
our reliance on a limited number of suppliers for our manufacturing makes us vulnerable to supplier operational problems 
manufacturing for our consumer software products is outsourced using hp software publishing as our primary supplier 
hp software publishing provides services such as parts procurement  parts warehousing  product assembly and supply chain services 
these services are provided to us from two primary hp locations nashua  new hampshire  servicing north america  and galway  ireland  servicing europe 
production services and supply chain logistics for asia and the pacific rim are serviced by moduslink  taipei 
hp and moduslink are non exclusive suppliers to us 
any disruption in the operations of these suppliers  or any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacturing and distributing our products and may adversely impact our operating results 
moreover  if these suppliers cease to perform or fail to perform as we expect  there is no guarantee that we would be able to engage a substitute supplier in a timely manner or at all or under terms and conditions acceptable to us 
our product prices may decline  which could harm our operating results 
the market for our software is intensely competitive 
it is likely that prices for our oem products will decline due to competitive pricing pressures from other software providers  competition in the pc and ce industries and concentration among oem customers resulting in their having strong negotiating positions relative to us 
in addition  we now derive a substantial portion of our revenue from retail sales  which also are subject to significant competitive pricing pressures 
we may experience additional pricing pressures in other parts of our business 
these trends could make it more difficult for us to increase or maintain our revenue and may cause a decline in our gross and or operating profits 
qualifying and supporting our products on multiple computer platforms is time consuming and expensive 
we devote significant time and resources to qualify and support our software products on various computer platforms  including microsoft and apple operating systems 
to the extent that any qualified and supported platform is modified or upgraded  or we need to qualify and support a new platform  we could be required to expend additional engineering time and resources  which may add significantly to our development expenses and adversely affect our operating results 
we may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute our existing shareholders ownership and harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as part of our efforts to enhance our existing products and services  introduce new products and services  grow our business and remain competitive  we have pursued  and we may continue to pursue acquisitions of companies  products and technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired businesses into our current operations  or expand into new markets 
future acquisitions by us could result in the following  any of which could seriously harm our results of operations  business  financial condition and or the price of our stock difficulties and delays in the assimilation and integration of operations  personnel  technologies  products  services  business relationships and information and other systems of the acquired businesses  the diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  issuance of equity securities that would dilute our current shareholders percentages of ownership  
table of contents large one time write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  contractual and or intellectual property disputes  difficulties caused by entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or only limited prior experience  potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses  acquired company not achieving anticipated levels of revenue  profitability or productivity  and poor acceptance by the investment community 
failure to successfully integrate any business we have acquired or may acquire in the future could negatively impact our results of operations  financial condition and business 
the integration of a new business into our existing business is a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
for example  our november acquisition of systemok  a software company based in gotenburg  sweden  entailed the integration of operations and the implementation of additional procedures and policies to comply with swedish legal requirements and our february acquisition of umedia  a chinese software development company  entails the integration of operations and the implementation of procedures and policies to consolidate this entity with our existing china entity and facilities 
additionally  our april acquisition of simple star entails the integration of operations and the implementation of systems  procedures and policies to comply with existing us requirements 
if our management is unable to minimize the potential disruption to our business during the integration process  the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized 
realizing the benefits of an acquisition will depend in part on the integration of technology  operations and personnel while maintaining adequate focus on our core businesses 
we may encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays in integrating various acquisitions  including but not limited to the following potential conflicts between business cultures  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse changes in business focus perceived by third parties such as customers  business partners and investors  potential conflicts in distribution  marketing or other important relationships  inability to implement uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  inability to integrate our research and development and product development efforts  loss or termination of key employees  including costly litigation or settlements resulting from the termination of those employees  disruptions among employees that may erode employee morale  undiscovered and unknown problems  defects or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only after the acquisition  and negative reactions from our resellers and customers to an acquisition 
our operating expenses may increase significantly over the near term due to the increased headcount  expanded operations and expense or changes related to an acquisition 
to the extent that our expenses associated with an acquisition increase but our revenues do not  there are unanticipated expenses related to the integration process  or there are significant costs associated with presently unknown liabilities or other problems  our business  operating results and financial condition will be affected adversely 
failure to minimize the numerous risks associated with post acquisition integration activities also may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

table of contents our failure to manage our expansion may adversely affect us 
our business has expanded significantly since fiscal  including our recent acquisitions of simple star  umedia and systemok 
in general  the scope of our business has expanded both domestically and internationally  including the establishment of foreign subsidiaries and offices 
our success depends on our ability to effectively manage our global operations 
our management team faces challenges inherent in efficiently managing employees over large geographic distances  including the need to implement appropriate systems  controls  policies  benefits and compliance programs 
our inability to successfully manage the geographically more diverse and expanded organization  or any significant delay in implementing appropriate systems  controls  policies  benefits and compliance programs  could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and  as a result  on the market price of our common stock 
we are subject to risks associated with international operations that may harm our business 
we depend on sales to customers outside the united states  in particular in europe and japan 
revenue derived from international customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  the occurrence of any adverse international political  economic or geographic events could result in significant revenue shortfalls  which could cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to be harmed 
as of march   we have eight major locations defined as location with more than employees and employ approximately employees outside the united states 
our management team faces the challenge of efficiently managing and integrating our international operations 
our increased international operations and dependence on foreign customers expose us to additional risks  including  but not limited to import and export restrictions and duties  including tariffs  quotas  and other barriers  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  foreign regulatory requirements  such as safety or radio frequency emissions regulations  liquidity problems in various foreign markets  uncertainties and liabilities associated with foreign tax laws  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  including more stringent consumer and data protection laws  unexpected changes in  or impositions of  foreign legislative or regulatory requirements  difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations  difficulties in staffing  managing  and operating our international operations  potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us law  political and economic instability  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and other factors beyond our control including terrorism  war  natural disasters and diseases  particularly in areas in which we have facilities 
revenue derived from our professional dvd products and services has declined in recent years and may continue to decline 
we have experienced revenue declines in the professional segment and  absent the introduction and market acceptance of new formats such as bd  and we expect such declines to continue 
professional dvd facilities began equipping to prepare dvd titles as early as  and significant expansion of dvd creation capacity occurred from to although the number of dvd discs replicated will continue to grow in future years  we do not expect that the number of titles published will expand as dramatically  hence we do 
table of contents not expect that dvd production facilities will increase the rate of their capacity expansion 
instead  they may decrease the rate of their expansion resulting in a lower level of sales for us 
our executive officers and other key personnel are critical to our business  and because there is significant competition for personnel in our industry  we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our success depends on the continued contributions of our executive management team  our technical  marketing  sales  customer support and product development personnel 
however  the competition for personnel is intense and we may have difficulty attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of key individuals or significant numbers of such personnel could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not have any life insurance or other insurance covering the loss of any of our key employees 
some of our competitors possess greater technological and financial resources than we do  may produce better or more cost effective products than ours and may be more effective than we are in marketing and promoting their products 
there is a substantial risk that competing companies will produce better or more cost effective products  or will be better equipped than we are to promote products in the marketplace 
a number of companies have announced or are delivering products that compete with our products 
these companies include adobe systems incorporated  apple computer inc  arcsoft inc  bha group  inc  corel corporation s subsidiary  cyberlink corp  nero  ag  network technologies incorporated  or nti  avid technology s pinnacle systems subsidiary 
many of these companies have greater financial and technological resources than we do 
with the growth in the internet as a medium to download and purchase software  we expect to face increasing competition from smaller software providers 
the increasing popularity of the internet as a medium to purchase software is enabling smaller software providers to distribute products with minimal upfront costs or resources 
in the past  a substantial barrier to entry into the packaged software market for small scale providers has been the need to manufacture  package and distribute software through a retail or commercial distribution chain 
to the extent consumers increasingly purchase software over the internet  we expect to face increased competition from small software development companies and programmers worldwide 
online software distribution has certain inherent advantages over physically packaged software  such as the reduction or elimination of manufacturing  packaging  shipping and inventory costs 
new entrants that have business models focused on internet distribution may have more favorable cost structures than companies such as ours that employ a multi channel distribution network  which could give those competitors cost savings  pricing and profitability advantages 
undetected errors or failures found in our products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could seriously harm our reputation and business 
our products may contain undetected software errors or failures  especially when first introduced or as new versions are released  and we may need to modify significantly our products to correct these errors 
failure to achieve acceptance could result in a delay in  or inability to  receive payment 
our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun  which could result in the rejection of our products and damage to our reputation  as well as lost revenues  diverted development resources  increased service and warranty costs and related litigation expenses and potential liability to third parties  any of which could harm our business 
we are vulnerable to earthquakes  labor issues and other unexpected events 
our corporate headquarters  as well as the majority of our research and development activities  are located in california and china  both of which are areas known for seismic activity 
an earthquake or other disaster could result in an interruption in our business 
our business also may be impacted by labor issues related to our operations and or those of our suppliers  distributors or customers 
such an interruption could harm our operating results 
we are not likely to have sufficient insurance to compensate adequately for losses that we may sustain as a result of any natural disasters or other unexpected events 

table of contents if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights we may not be able to market our products successfully 
unlicensed copying and use of our intellectual property or illegal infringements of our intellectual property rights represent losses of revenue to our company 
our products are based in large part on proprietary technology which we have sought to protect with patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets 
for example  we have many patents and pending applications for additional patents in the united states and in foreign countries 
we also make significant efforts to acquire trademark protection for the names and brands of our software products  services and unique product features 
in addition  we make extensive use of trade secrets  which we may not be able to protect adequately 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products may be manufactured  marketed  distributed  sold or used 
moreover  despite our efforts  these measures only provide limited protection 
third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization 
to the extent that we use patents to protect our proprietary rights  we may not be able to obtain needed patents or  if granted  the patents may be held invalid or otherwise unenforceable 
patent protection throughout the world is generally established on a country by country basis 
failure to obtain patents or failure to enforce those patents that are obtained may result in a loss of revenue to us 
we cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not develop independently similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any of our patents or other intellectual property rights 
our business could be harmed seriously if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology adequately  if there are changes in applicable laws that are adverse to our interests  or if we become involved in legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology or relating to the intellectual property rights of others 
to the extent we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  competitors also may enter the market offering products substantially similar or identical to ours  which likely would have a negative impact on sales of our products 
other companies intellectual property rights may interfere with our current or future product development and sales 
we have never conducted a comprehensive patent search relating to our business models or the technology we use in our products or services 
there may be issued or pending patents owned by third parties that relate to our business models  products or services 
if so  we could incur substantial costs defending against patent infringement claims or we could even be blocked from engaging in certain business endeavors or selling our products or services 
other companies may succeed in obtaining valid patents covering one or more of our business models or key aspects of our products or services 
if so  we may be forced to obtain required licenses or implement alternative non infringing approaches 
our products are designed to comply with industry standards  such as dvd rom  dvd video  dvd audio and mpeg video 
a number of companies and organizations hold various patents that claim to cover various aspects of dvd  mpeg and other relevant technology 
we have entered into license agreements with certain companies and organizations relative to some of these technologies 
for instance  we have entered into license agreements with dolby s licensing affiliate covering dolby digital audio  with mpeg la see we may become involved in costly and time consuming patent litigation below covering various aspects of mpeg video compression technology  and with thomson fraunhofer covering various aspects of mpeg layer mp audio compression technology  among others 
such license agreements may not be sufficient to grant us all of the intellectual property rights necessary to manufacture  market and sell our products 
we may become involved in costly and time consuming patent litigation 
we face risks associated with our patent position  including the potential need to engage in significant legal proceedings to enforce our patents  the possibility that the validity or enforceability of our patents may be denied  the possibility that third parties will be able to compete against us without infringing our patents and the possibility that our products or services may infringe patent rights of third parties 
budgetary concerns may cause us not to file or continue litigation against known infringers of our patent rights 
failure to reliably enforce our patent rights against infringers could make licensing more difficult 

table of contents third parties could pursue us claiming that our business models  products or services infringe various patents 
for example  a group of companies have formed an organization called mpeg la to enforce the rights of holders of patents covering aspects of mpeg technology 
although we have entered into an agreement with mpeg la  that agreement may not prevent third parties not represented by mpeg la from asserting that we infringe a patent covering some aspects of mpeg technology 
in addition  as new standards and technologies evolve and as our relative commercial presence expands  we believe that we may face an increasing number of third party claims relating to patent infringements and potential patent infringements over time 
patent infringement litigation can be time consuming and costly  may divert management resources and could result in the invalidation of our intellectual property rights 
if such litigation resulted in an unfavorable outcome for us  we could be subject to substantial damage claims and or be required to cease production of infringing products  terminate our use of infringing technology  develop non infringing technology and or obtain a license agreement to continue using the technology at issue 
such license agreements might not be available to us on acceptable terms  resulting in serious harm to our business 
our use of technology asserted to be infringing could result in liability that threatens our continuing operations 
we may be liable to some of our customers for damages that they incur in connection with intellectual property claims 
although we attempt to limit our exposure to liability arising from infringement of third party intellectual property rights in our license agreements with customers  we do not always succeed in obtaining the limitations we seek 
if we are required to pay damages to or incur liability on behalf of our customers  our business could be harmed 
moreover  even if a particular claim falls outside of our indemnity or warranty obligations to our customers  our customers may be entitled to additional contractual remedies against us  which could harm our business 
furthermore  even if we are not liable to our customers  our customers may stop buying our products or attempt to pass on to us the cost of any license fees or damages owed to third parties by reducing the amounts they pay for our products 
any of these results could harm our business 
we may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not effectively reduce our exposure 
our operating results are subject to volatility resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  including currency movements in which the us dollar becomes stronger with respect to foreign currencies  thereby reducing relative demand for our products and services outside the united states  and currency movements in which a foreign currency in which we incur expenses becomes stronger in relation to the us dollar  thereby raising our expenses for the same level of operating activity 
our revolving credit facility imposes significant operating and financial restrictions  which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some actions 
our revolving credit facility imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  make investments  sell assets  incur certain liens  or merge or consolidate with other businesses 
in addition  our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
we cannot assure you that these covenants will not hinder our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to pursue available business opportunities 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios could result in a default under the related indebtedness 
we have been in violation of certain covenants set forth in our credit facility in the past and have successfully obtained waivers from the lender 
there can be no assurance that  in the event of future violations  we will continue to be able to obtain such waivers 
if a default occurs  the lender could elect to declare the indebtedness  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness 
currently  the borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
further  we may require additional capital in the future to expand our business operations  acquire businesses or replenish cash expended sooner than anticipated 
our current revolving credit facility may restrict us from obtaining additional capital or such additional capital may not otherwise be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 

table of contents we may be unable to utilize loss carry forwards and tax credits in the future 
we have recorded deferred tax assets  net of valuation reserves  of million related to net operating loss carryforwards  million of which we obtained through our acquisition of interactual technologies  inc in the acquired federal net operating loss carry forwards are subject to annual use limitations under code section the majority of our net operating loss carryforwards expire between and we may not be able to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  we have million of federal research and development credits that will expire from through and million of foreign tax credits that will expire between and if not utilized 
changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices can be expensive to implement  can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
our stock price has been volatile  is likely to continue to be volatile  and could decline substantially 
the price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for any of the following reasons  among others future announcements concerning us or our competitors  earnings announcements  quarterly variations in operating results  including variations due to one time payments and other non recurring revenues that may result from certain customer relationships  as well as variations due to the timing of revenue recognition  including deferrals of revenue  charges  amortization and other financial effects relating to any future acquisitions or divestitures  introduction of new products or services or changes in product or service pricing policies by us or our competitors  or the entry of new competitors into the digital media software markets  acquisition or loss of significant customers  distributors or suppliers  changes in earnings estimates by us or by independent analysts who cover us  issuances of stock under our current or any future shelf registration statement  fluctuations in the us or world economy or general market conditions  as well as those specific to specific to the pc  ce and related industries  delay in delivery to market or acceptance of new products  disclosure of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures or of other corporate governance issues  costs of litigation and intellectual property claims  including the legal costs incurred to protect our intellectual property rights and settlement of claims based upon our violation or alleged violation of others intellectual property rights  and or impact of our stock option review and the related employee share based compensation expense on our earnings per share 
in addition  stock markets in general  and those for technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years  which frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
these broad market fluctuations may impact adversely the market price of our common stock 
these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance 

table of contents in the past  shareholders of various companies often have instituted securities class action litigation after periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
in any such lawsuit  we could incur substantial legal fees and our management s attention and resources could be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 
we have significant amount of assets on our balance sheet for which their realization is dependent on our future profitability 
as of march   we have goodwill and acquired intangibles of million 
although we have tested our goodwill and acquired intangibles for impairment and have concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded carrying value and market capitalization and that our goodwill and acquired intangibles are not impaired  the estimated fair value of our intangibles will be influenced by our future profitability 
if we are unable to return to or sustain adequate levels of profitability  we may need to write off a portion or all of these assets  which could result in a reduction of our assets and shareholders equity

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that make future results difficult to predict  certain items to remember when reading our financial statements our quarterly and annual operating results vary significantly depending on the timing of new product introductions  product enhancements by us and by our competitors  and the finalization of the terms of and deliveries under our larger software license agreements 
our results also depend on the volume and timing of our professional customer orders and on shipments of our oem partners  which are difficult to forecast 
because our professional customers generally order on an as needed basis and we normally ship products within one week after receipt of an order  and because our oem partners report shipments during or at the end of the period  we do not have an order backlog that can assist us in forecasting results 
for these reasons  as well as those described under risk factors  in item a above  our results of operations for any quarter or any year are a poor indicator of the results to be expected in any future quarter or year 
our ongoing operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we plan our expenditures based primarily on sales forecasts 
as a result  operating results can be negatively affected if oem partner shipments do not meet our forecast  if professional revenue generated in the last few weeks of a quarter or year do not meet our forecast  or if large license agreements are not finalized when forecasted 
legal proceedings between march and june  we were notified that a total of five shareholder derivative lawsuits had been filed by persons identifying themselves as our shareholders and purporting to act on our behalf  naming us as a nominal defendant and naming some of our current and former officers and directors as defendants 
four of these actions were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california  and one was filed in the superior court of california for the county of marin 
in these actions  the plaintiffs assert claims against the individual defendants for violations of the exchange act  violations of the california corporations code  breach of fiduciary duty and or aiding and abetting  abuse of control  gross mismanagement  corporate waste  unjust enrichment  rescission  constructive fraud  and an accounting and a constructive trust 
the plaintiffs claims concern the granting of stock options by us and the alleged filing of false and misleading financial statements 
all of these claims are asserted derivatively on our behalf 
the plaintiffs seek  among other relief  an indeterminate amount of damages from the individual defendants and a judgment directing us to reform our corporate governance 
the federal cases were consolidated on august  into one action captioned wilder v 
doris  et al 
c nd nd on september   the court in the state action granted our motion to stay that proceeding in its entirety until final resolution of the consolidated federal action 
the court in the state action is scheduled to review the status of the stay on september  in addition to the derivative actions  two putative shareholder class actions have been filed against us and various of our executive officers and directors 
on october   a putative shareholder class action was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california  against us and various of our executive officers and directors on behalf of a proposed class of plaintiffs comprised of persons that purchased our shares between october  and may  on march   plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint against us and various of our executive officers and directors on behalf of a proposed class of plaintiffs comprised of persons that purchased our shares between october  and may  this action alleges various violations of the exchange act and the rules thereunder  and is based on substantially similar factual allegations and claims as in the derivative actions 
on november   a putative shareholder class action was filed in the superior court of california for the county of marin  against us and various of our executive officers and directors on behalf of a proposed class of plaintiffs comprised of persons that purchased our shares between july  and may  this action alleges breach of fiduciary duties  and is based on substantially similar factual allegations and claims as in the other lawsuits 
the court in the state putative shareholder class action sustained our demurrers to the complaint with leave to amend 
on april   the plaintiffs in that action filed an amended complaint  and on may   we filed additional demurrers to the complaint 

table of contents we may become subject to additional private or government actions 
the expense of defending such litigation may be significant 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial statements 
overview of business we develop and market computer software related to digital media that is  data  photographs  audio  interactive features and video in digital formats 
our products create  design and deliver digital media across a wide variety of playback platforms  including broadband  broadcast  mobile and optical disc formats such as compact audio disc cd audio  digital video disc dvd  blu ray disc bd as well as other emerging formats 
our software is used to accomplish a variety of tasks  including creating digital audio and video titles in the cd audio  dvd  bd and other formats  recording data files on cd  dvd and bd and other recordable disc formats  producing online digital media photo and video shows for sharing via the web  tv  pc and mobile devices  editing digital audio  photos and video  playing dvd  bd and other disc formats  as well as digital content from other storage media and portable devices  transferring digital media and data between computer and portable devices such as mobile phones  portable game players  and personal audio or video players  managing digital media on computers and ce devices  securely burning content scrambling system css encrypted dvds using the qflix standard  and backing up the information contained on hard disks attached to pcs and ce devices 
we sell our products to both consumer and professional end users 
we also license the software technology underlying our products to other companies to incorporate into products they develop 
most of the software we sell is intended for use in the windows and macintosh operating system environments  but some operate in linux environments or on proprietary platforms as well 
we organize our business into two reportable operating segments consumer and professional 
these segments reflect our internal organization and the processes by which our management makes operating decisions  allocates resources and assesses performance 
consumer our consumer segment consists of divisions that share similar technologies  products  services  production processes  customers  and distribution methods the roxio division and the advanced technology group atg 
roxio division the roxio division offers a number of consumer digital media software products under the roxio brand name 
our applications include backontrack tm  backup mypc  cineplayer  crunch tm  just burn tm  mydvd  mytv to go tm  photoshow tm  photosuite  popcorn  recordnow  roxio copy convert tm  roxio easy media creator  toast  videowave  winoncd  and others 
we sell and market these products through four primary channels product bundling arrangements with oem suppliers of related products  volume licensing programs vlp to corporate purchasers  direct to consumer sales on our web store and retail resellers both online and bricks and mortar resellers 
since acquiring the consumer software division csd of roxio in december  we have transitioned all of our consumer applications software products to the roxio brand 
advanced technology group atg develops software components that it supplies to the other two operating units and that it licenses to pc and ce application developers 
we market much of this software under the roxio  authorscript  cineplayer  and qflix tm brand names 
atg customers 
table of contents include oem suppliers who wish to integrate our technology into products similar to the ones we distribute directly to end users through our roxio division 
atg also collaborates with our corporate strategy group in the management of our patent program  under which we develop  acquire  license and sell patents 
we group the roxio division and atg into a single segment since it is difficult to draw a clear distinction between their business activities both sell or license cd dvd burning  cd dvd playback and related digital media products ultimately targeted at consumers  the advanced technology group develops much of the core engine technology behind both its own and roxio products  our engineers  sales staff and other personnel transfer and or share responsibilities between the two units in order to efficiently manage business flow and meet client needs  the two units often share budget and management responsibilities for particular initiatives  and both units engage in similar sales processes targeted at similar potential customers 
for these reasons  our management does not regularly review operating results broken out separately for the roxio division and advanced technology group in deciding how to allocate resources or in assessing performance 
our consumer segment accounted for approximately of our net revenue for fiscal year see note  significant customer information  segment reporting and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of our financial data by business segment 
net revenue for fiscal year decreased to million from million for fiscal year international sales decreased to of net revenue for fiscal year from of net revenue for fiscal year approximately and of our net revenue for fiscal year resulted from sales to dell and hewlett packard  respectively 
sales to our domestic and international distributors  digital river  ingram and navarre  accounted for  and  of our revenues  respectively 
the loss of any of these customers or distributors would have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
on october   we initiated a restructuring plan to reorganize our operations  optimize our engineering and development efforts  and reduce our workforce by closing our office in richmond hill  canada 
in december we implemented this reorganization and closed the richmond hill office by december  we incurred severance and other one time restructuring charges in connection with this closing  and eliminated approximately positions due to the closure 
we also accrued approximately million related to the lease for this office  which expires in december professional our professional segment consists of one division  our professional products group 
the professional products group develops  sells  and provides technical support for a range of comprehensive authoring solutions that enable commercial content owners such as major hollywood motion picture studios to create and distribute high end commercially released packaged media dvd video  bd and titles in other formats to mass consumer markets worldwide 
intended for use by highly skilled content creation customers  high end authoring houses  major motion picture studios and disc replicators  our professional solutions are marketed and sold under the scenarist  cinevision tm  and dvdit product names and sonic and roxio professional tm brands 
we also sell content development technology  products and services under the interactual brand name  enabling professional dvd rom publishers to create advanced interactivity and seamless internet connectivity for dvd video titles 
additionally  we license and or bundle some of our professional authoring products to third party companies 
our interactual enabled software dvd player is licensed to hollywood studios for inclusion on motion picture packaged media releases to consumers who view dvd video discs on pcs 
our professional products and services are offered to our customers through a worldwide sales force augmented with a specialized dealer network 
our professional products and services accounted for approximately of our net revenue for fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that can significantly affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
table of contents under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we regularly evaluate our estimates  judgments  and assumptions and make changes accordingly 
of the significant accounting policies described in note  summary of operations and significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following are the most critical to aid in understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from licenses of our software products  software development agreements and maintenance and support 
we also sell and license patents and patented technology 
we recognize software related revenue in accordance with american institute of certified accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
if we determine that any of the above criteria has not been met  we will defer recognition of the revenue until all the criteria have been met 
we generally consider arrangements with payment terms longer than six months from the time of delivery not to be fixed or determinable and recognize the related revenue as payments become due from the customer  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fees and recognize revenue upon cash receipt  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we follow emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as principal versus net as an agent 
generally  we record revenue at gross and record costs related to a sale in cost of revenue 
in those cases where we are not the primary obligor or merchant of record and or do not bear credit risk  or where we earn a fixed transactional fee  we record revenue under the net method 
when we record revenues at net  revenue is reported at the net amount received and retained by us 
multiple element arrangements in arrangements that include multiple elements eg  software  specified upgrades  support services  installation services  and or training  we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement to the elements based on their relative fair value  as determined by vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 
vsoe is generally the price charged when that element is sold separately or  in the case of support services  annual renewal rates 
in arrangements where vsoe exists only for the undelivered elements  we use the residual method under sop  under which we defer the full fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for undelivered items as revenue 
if vsoe does not exist for all elements but the only undelivered element is maintenance and support  we recognize revenue from the arrangement ratably over the maintenance and support period 
if vsoe does not exist for undelivered elements that are specified products or upgrades  we defer revenue until the earlier of the delivery of all elements or the point at which we determine vsoe for these undelivered elements 
product sales except in the case of consignment arrangements  we recognize revenue from the sale of our packaged software products when title transfers to the distributor or retailer 
when we sell packaged software products to distributors and retailers on a consignment basis  we recognize revenue upon sell through to an end customer 

table of contents our distributor arrangements often provide distributors with certain product rotation rights 
in such situations  we recognize product sales in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
we estimate returns based on our historical return experience and other factors such as channel inventory levels and the introduction of new products 
these allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenues and as an offset to accounts receivable to the extent we have legal right of offset  otherwise they are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
if future return patterns differ from past return patterns  for example due to reduced demand for our product  we may be required to increase these allowances in the future and may be required to reduce future revenues 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s product  we account for cash consideration such as sales incentives that we give to our customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that is separate from the customer s purchase from us and for which we can reasonably estimate the fair value 
software license arrangements provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize revenue from software licensing arrangements upon delivery  or  in the case of per unit royalty arrangements  upon sell through to an end user as evidenced by the receipt of a customer royalty report 
software development arrangements for arrangements that include development or other services that are essential to the functionality of the licensed software  we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  management estimates the number of hours needed to complete a particular project  and revenues are recognized as the contract progresses to completion 
changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are known 
in certain instances  a development agreement may include additional undelivered elements  such as maintenance and support  or a specified upgrade or other deliverable  and vsoe of fair value may not exist for the undelivered elements  or we may not have sufficient experience with either the type of project or the customer involved to be able to make reliable estimates towards completion 
if we cannot reliably estimate total profitability under the agreement but are reasonably assured that no loss will be realized on the agreement  we recognize revenue using the zero gross margin method 
under the zero gross margin method  revenue recognized under the contract equals costs incurred under the contract  and any profit is deferred until development is complete 
we recognize the deferred gross profit over the remaining contractual service period for example  the initial maintenance period 
allowance for product returns and doubtful accounts our distributor and retail arrangements provide for certain product rotation rights and permit certain product returns 
we estimate reserves for these rights of return based on historical return rates  timing of new product releases  and channel inventory levels 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts based on past collection history and specific risks identified in our portfolio of receivables 
if the financial condition of our distributors or other customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if payments from distributors or other customers are significantly delayed  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment at least annually  in our fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant 

table of contents we evaluate goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value including the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment often referred to as a component 
for the purpose of evaluating goodwill  we combine the roxio and atg components of our consumer segment into one reporting unit as they have similar economic characteristics and it is difficult to draw a clear distinction between their operating activities 
to determine the reporting unit s fair value  we use the income approach under which we evaluate estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit 
we base our cash flow assumptions on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs 
we evaluate long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite useful lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives is based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of that asset and its eventual disposition 
as of march   no events occurred that would lead us to believe that there has been any intangible asset impairment 
share based compensation on april   we adopted sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all equity based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including stock options and restricted stock units rsus  based on estimated fair values 
sfas no 
r applies to all outstanding and unvested share based payment awards at adoption 
on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab providing supplemental implementation guidance for sfas no 
r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas no 
r 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and will be recognized over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for share based compensation related to employee share based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 
 and complied with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option shares 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
see note  shareholders equity  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further information regarding these assumptions 
the fair value of rsus is equivalent to the market price of our common stock on the grant date 
if factors change  share based compensation for the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
additionally  the black scholes merton option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  which are characteristics not present in our option grants 
existing assumptions used and valuation modeling may not provide measures of the fair values of our share based compensation that reflect the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
currently  there are only 
table of contents very limited market based mechanisms or other practical applications to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  and there is no means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
the provision for income taxes is calculated using the liability method of accounting 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
when we do not believe realization of a deferred tax asset is likely  we record a valuation allowance 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
effective april   we adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with fas the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions as well as related interest and penalties 
see note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
other disclosures contingencies as described in part i  item  legal proceedings and part ii  item  note  contingencies  commitments and credit facilities  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we are subject to various claims relating to products  technology  patent  shareholder and other matters 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
the amount of loss accrual  if any  is determined after careful analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted

consumer product revenues increased due to higher revenue from new and existing oem partners 
the decrease in our professional products revenue was due to lower sales of standard definition dvd products and the content community s slow adoption of new high definition disc formats as a result of the continued competition between hd dvd and bd 
the decrease in the professional products revenue was also due to a change in revenue recognizable for the sale of software licenses when bundled with maintenance and support agreements 
for the quarter ended december   we determined that we did not have vsoe for certain maintenance and support agreements associated with our professional products 
thus  beginning with the quarter ended december   we defer revenue associated with professional product software licenses when sold with bundled maintenance and support services and recognize the revenue over the maintenance and support period which is generally one year

our options for the rate include a the base rate or b a libor rate plus an applicable margin the libor option 
the base rate is defined as the higher of the federal funds rate as in effect from time to time plus or the rate of interest most recently announced from time to time by uboc as its united states dollar reference rate

most recently  we entered into an amendment on march  that  among other things  waived certain defaults and extended the term of the facility through june  as of march   the outstanding balance on the amended credit facility was million and was classified as a current liability 
as of june   uboc has not notified us of any intent to take the actions necessary to accelerate the repayment of our obligations under the amended credit facility 
we are currently evaluating our options for either negotiating an additional extension of the term of the current facility or securing a new facility 
if we are unable to secure an extension of the term of the current facility with uboc  we will repay the balance from our existing cash balances and will seek to secure a new facility 
as part of our business strategy  we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies 
accordingly  a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses 
such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources  which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our current shareholders will be reduced  shareholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock
