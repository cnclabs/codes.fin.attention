table of contents business segments we operate two nationwide  primarily mall based  chains of retail stores under the names wet seal and arden b 
although the two operating segments are similar in their products  production processes  distribution methods and regulatory environment  they are distinct in their economic characteristics 
as a result  we consider these segments as two distinct reportable segments 
wet seal 
wet seal is the junior apparel brand for teenage girls that seek trend focused and value competitive clothing with a target customer age of to years old 
wet seal seeks to provide its customer base with a balance of affordably priced fashionable apparel and accessories 
arden b 
arden b is a fashion brand for the feminine contemporary woman with sex appeal 
arden b targets customers aged to and seeks to deliver contemporary collections of fashion separates and accessories for various aspects of the customers lifestyles 
we maintain a web based store located at www 
wetseal 
com  offering wet seal merchandise to customers over the internet 
we also maintain a web based store located at www 
ardenb 
com  offering arden b apparel and accessories comparable to those carried in the stores 
our online stores are designed to serve as an extension of the in store experience  and offer a wide selection of merchandise  which helps expand in store sales 
internet operations for both wet seal and arden b are included in their respective operating segments 
in fiscal and  we experienced rapid growth in both visitor traffic and our online sales and we will continue to develop our wet seal and arden b websites to increase their effectiveness in marketing our brands 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding segment reporting  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
our stores wet seal stores average approximately  square feet in size and in fiscal had average sales per square foot of as of february   we operated wet seal stores 
arden b stores average approximately  square feet in size and in fiscal had average sales per square foot of as of february   we operated arden b stores 
in december  we announced the closing of approximately wet seal stores as part of our turnaround strategy 
we completed our inventory liquidation sales and the closing of wet seal stores in march during fiscal  we scaled back plans to open new stores in an effort to limit capital expenditures and concentrate our efforts on restoring the core business 
during fiscal  we opened and closed four wet seal stores and opened four and closed four arden b stores 
during fiscal  we opened and closed ten wet seal stores and opened seven and closed four arden b stores 
we believe future closures for at least the next months following the date of this annual report will primarily result from lease expirations where we decide not to extend  or are unable to extend  a store lease 
we expect our store count to remain relatively flat  or increase nominally  in fiscal to allow time to re assess our real estate strategy  build our backlog of store opening opportunities  and maintain focus on managing our existing store base through a challenging retail environment we expect will persist through fiscal we have approximately existing store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal we expect to negotiate new leases that will allow us to remain in a substantial majority of these locations 
our ability to increase the number of wet seal and arden b stores in the future will depend  in part  on satisfactory cash flows from existing operations  the demand for our merchandise  our ability to find suitable mall or other locations with 
table of contents acceptable sites and satisfactory terms  and general business conditions 
our management does not believe there are significant geographic constraints on the locations of future stores 
competitive strengths experienced management team is in place 
although we have recently had changes among our senior management team  the current members of our senior management have extensive knowledge of our business and operations which will be instrumental in driving our company into the next phase of its growth cycle 
mr 
edmond s 
thomas  our new president and chief executive officer  formerly served as the president and chief operating officer of our company from to our new chief financial officer  steven h 
benrubi  served as our controller for over two years prior to his appointment as chief financial officer 
dyan jozwick has served as chief merchandise officer for our wet seal division for nearly two years 
sharon hughes  the consultant that we have hired to lead the arden b merchandising efforts on an interim basis  was an employee of our company from through during this period ms 
hughes was involved in the formation of the arden b division and held several different merchant roles  including senior vice president of merchandising 
merchandising model at wet seal is focused on fast fashion at affordable prices 
at wet seal  we have developed considerable expertise in identifying  stocking and selling a broad assortment of fresh  fashionable apparel and accessories at competitive prices 
our buyers work closely with senior management to determine the optimal product selection  promotion and pricing strategy 
a significant portion of our merchandise is sourced domestically 
this sourcing strategy enables us to ship new merchandise to the stores with high frequency 
we also take regular markdowns to effect the rapid sale of slow moving inventory 
improved financial condition 
since the completion of a recapitalization of our company in may  our financial condition has improved materially 
during fiscal  and  we experienced positive comparable store sales growth  on a consolidated basis  in eight out of twelve fiscal quarters and had positive cash flow from operations in each of those fiscal years 
due to the improvement in our financial performance since the end of fiscal  we have been able to reduce our outstanding indebtedness 
through fiscal  million in principal amount of our convertible notes had been converted into shares of our class a common stock 
we used the proceeds from a may financing transaction to repay a bridge loan that we received from investors in a january recapitalization of our company 
in addition  in march  we repaid the million outstanding balance of a junior secured term loan under our then existing credit facility  and in fiscal and  we repurchased million shares and million shares  respectively  of our class a common stock for million and million  respectively 
as of february   our total debt  net of discount  is million  stockholders equity is million and cash and cash equivalents is million 
the improvement in our financial condition gives us the ability to invest in opening new wet seal and arden b stores 
strategic review of business operations since his appointment in october  our new chief executive officer has identified areas in which our company s business and operations can be improved 
our chief executive officer has focused on increasing comparable store sales for our retail divisions  improving our company s gross margin  enhancing new store productivity  reviving the arden b business and expanding our online business 
as a result  we have implemented cost cutting initiatives and identified strategic opportunities regarding merchandise margin  store operations  real estate  marketing  information systems  and physical distribution and transportation 
as part of our cost cutting initiatives  in january  we eliminated positions in our corporate offices  and two positions in field operations  across numerous functional areas 

table of contents as part of a strategic review of business operations  we believe we have significant opportunities to improve our business trends and drive sales improvement 
the key elements of our opportunities are to improve merchandise margin in our wet seal division  we have identified opportunities to improve our planning and allocation function  merchandise mix and markdown cadence 
during fiscal  we will complete merchandising profiles of each wet seal store and integrate them into our planning and allocation function 
we plan to improve our assortment planning and size optimization  increase our focus on key merchandise item categories  expand our bottoms offering and add denim brands to the merchandise mix 
in our arden b division  we have identified opportunities to improve inventory management  merchandise mix  and sourcing and to modify price points  where appropriate 
we plan to better align our merchandise mix with customer needs through improving the balance of wear to work  everyday and occasion apparel  and adding fashion basics across key merchandise item categories 
additionally  we will reassess our sourcing process and employ more consistent pricing practices and improved promotional disciplines 
improve store operations our store operation opportunities include an improved alignment of incentive compensation with selling performance  better utilization of customer feedback and improved performance in under producing new stores 
we plan to establish stronger accountability by developing incentive plans aligned with store sales growth and store profitability 
we will evaluate store tasks to determine if excess tasks can be eliminated to facilitate greater focus on sales 
we will realign operations management of both the wet seal and arden b divisions to reduce costs 
finally  we plan to employ more detailed analysis and monitoring of new store performance 
improve real estate we will seek to improve our new store economics and address pressure from rising occupancy and store construction costs 
additionally  we plan to test off mall locations by opening a small number of stores in regional power centers during fiscal we plan to rebuild the pipeline for store growth and rationalize current deals in the pipeline  which we estimate will reduce fiscal store openings to approximately to stores 
improve marketing we believe we have opportunity to improve our marketing planning and alignment of our messages to the divisional merchandising strategies 
we are developing specific plans for each division for fiscal we intend to place more emphasis on visual merchandising  direct marketing and grass roots marketing  while reducing our magazine advertising  as we believe there is a much better return on investment in the grass roots approach 
we also intend to increase emphasis on direct mail and heighten our focus on customer acquisition 
additionally  we intend to increase our use of internet marketing to drive increased store traffic 
improve information systems we believe we have opportunity to reduce costs and improve the efficiency of our information systems 
we will conduct an independent review of our information systems infrastructure to determine immediate cost savings 
additionally  we will develop short term and long term information systems strategies and install improved project management and cost controls 
improve physical distribution and transport our physical distribution and transport opportunities include facilitating more efficient store operations by resuming daily shipping to stores and  eventually  delivering merchandise to stores that is floor ready 
resume our positive comparable store sales trend from fiscal through  we experienced seven out of eight quarters of positive comparable store sales results  on a consolidated basis  versus the negative comparable store sales trends of fiscal these improvements resulted primarily from increased transaction counts and the number of items purchased per customer  partially offset by a decrease in average retail price per item sold due to a change in pricing strategy 
after positive comparable store sales results in the first quarter of fiscal  we have experienced three consecutive quarters of comparable store sales declines  on a consolidated basis  in the low single digits 
in fiscal  we experienced a decrease in comparable store sales principally due to decreases in the number of transactions generated per store and the number of items purchased per customer

for fiscal  we experienced moderate growth in comparable store sales results versus the dramatically improved results we had in fiscal the decrease in growth was principally due to a merchandising misstep and delays in inventory receipts  which caused our wet seal stores to lack fashion tops and dresses in may and june our merchandising team identified the issue and adjusted purchasing levels  thus restoring our positive comparable store sales momentum in each month from july through the end of fiscal in fiscal  we plan on improving comparable store sales with the implementation of identified strategic initiatives noted above  which includes better alignment of our merchandise mix with customer needs  efficiencies in our planning and allocation functions  and the alignment of store incentive compensation with selling performance 
revive arden b in february  we engaged sharon hughes as a consultant to serve as the chief merchandise officer for arden b under the direction and supervision of mr 
thomas 
we believe our primary opportunity for the arden b division is in the adjustment of our merchandise mix 
we are adjusting our assortments at arden b to include more fashion basic and wear to work merchandise 
we believe arden b has yet to achieve its full potential with its core young contemporary customer 
we aim to drive sales and profitability at arden b through distinctive  quality merchandise  unified apparel and accessory assortments and an improved in store customer experience 
expand our online business we plan to continue to grow our internet business through several initiatives  including a focus on integrated branding  targeted marketing programs utilizing our customer database and our customer loyalty programs 
although our internet sales are modest compared to consolidated net sales  we are experiencing substantial growth 
a combination of several changes contributed to the improvement  including hiring the right staff with internet marketing experience  changing processes to make them scalable  aligning the 
table of contents online sites to the look of the stores and implementing appropriate targeted marketing 
we are optimizing inventory allocated to the internet business to better meet demand and have strengthened our buying and planning staff to meet the anticipated sales growth in this area 
we plan to continue to grow our internet business through continued improvements to inventory planning  fulfillment  and customer service 
the growth in website traffic continues to be substantial and the internet is a key component for driving store traffic 
prior to the holiday season  we launched a new website platform for both divisions 
the new websites support advanced merchandising capabilities  personalization based on browsing behavior and past purchase history  and testing tools to measure and determine the most effective content and promotion strategies 
design  buying and product development our design and buying teams are responsible for identifying evolving fashion trends and developing themes to guide our merchandising strategy 
each retail division has a separate buying team 
the merchandising teams for each retail division develop fashion themes and strategies through assessing customer responses to current trends  shopping international and appropriate domestic markets  and using fashion services and gathering references from industry publications 
after selecting fashion themes  the design and buying teams work closely with vendors to use colors  materials and designs that create images consistent with the themes for our product offerings 
since fiscal for our wet seal division  and beginning in fiscal for our arden b division  we have decreased our dependency on internally designed merchandise 
this allows us more flexibility to respond to the changing fashion trends of our target customers  to buy in smaller lots and to reduce product development lead times 
see also allocation and distribution below 
marketing  advertising and promotion we believe that our brands are among our most important assets 
our ability to successfully increase brand awareness is dependent upon our ability to address the changing needs and priorities of each brand s target customers 
we will place more emphasis on visual merchandising  direct marketing and grass roots marketing  while reducing our magazine advertising as we believe there is a much better return on investment in these marketing approaches 
we will also increase emphasis on direct mail  heighten our focus on customer acquisition  and increase our use of internet marketing to drive increased store traffic 
during fiscal   and  we spent   and  respectively  of net sales on advertising 
in fiscal  our primary marketing focus was on in store promotion programs for the wet seal stores and print media for the arden b stores  which included publications in various magazines throughout the year 
as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this annual report  we offer a frequent buyer program in our wet seal stores in order to build loyalty to the brand  increase the frequency of visits  promote multiple item purchases and gain direct access to the customer 
as part of this program we send e mails to participants to notify them of special in store promotions 
our arden b division also offers a loyalty program  b rewarded  designed for the same purposes as that of our wet seal division 
sourcing and vendor relationships we purchase our merchandise from both domestic and foreign vendors 
for fiscal  approximately of our retail merchandising receipts were directly imported from foreign vendors 
although in fiscal no single vendor provided more than of our merchandise  management believes we are the largest customer of many of our smaller vendors 
quality control is monitored at the distribution points of our largest vendors and manufacturers  and merchandise is inspected upon arrival at our foothill ranch  california facility 

table of contents we do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any single supplier  and there are many vendors who could supply our merchandise 
allocation and distribution our merchandising effort primarily focuses on maintaining a regular flow of fresh  fashionable merchandise into our stores 
successful execution depends in large part on our integrated planning  allocation and distribution functions 
by working closely with store operations management and merchandise buyers  our teams of planners and allocators manage inventory levels and coordinate the allocation of merchandise to each of our stores based on sales volume and store size  demographics  climate and other factors that may influence an individual store s product mix 
all merchandise for retail stores is received from vendors at our foothill ranch  california distribution center  where items are inspected and prepared for shipping to our stores 
we ship all of our merchandise to our stores by common carrier 
consistent with our goal of maintaining the freshness of our product offerings  we frequently ship new merchandise to stores  and markdowns are taken regularly to effect the rapid sale of slow moving inventory 
marked down merchandise that remains unsold is either sent to clearance centers for deep discounting and rapid movement  sold to an outside clearance company or given to charity 
the fulfillment process and distribution of merchandise for our online business is performed at our foothill ranch distribution center 
information and control systems our merchandise  financial and store computer systems are integrated and operate using primarily oracle technology 
we have invested in a large data warehouse that provides management  buyers and planners comprehensive data that helps us identify emerging trends and manage inventories 
the core merchandise system is provided by a leading retail enterprise resource planning  or erp  software provider  and is frequently enhanced to support strategic business initiatives 
all of our stores have a point of sale system operating on software provided by a leading provider of specialty retailing point of sale systems 
this system facilitates bar coded ticket scanning  automatic price look ups and centralized credit authorizations 
all stores are networked to the corporate office via a centrally managed virtual private network 
we utilize a store portal that is integrated with the corporate merchandise erp system to provide the stores and corporate staff with current information regarding sales  promotions  inventory and shipments  and enables more efficient communications with the corporate office 
in fiscal  we installed new wide area networking hardware at all stores which incorporate security upgrades to guard against security breaches to our stores point of sale system  completed our merchandise allocation system  upgraded our financial system  and launched a new website platform for the online business 
in fiscal  we anticipate implementing a new time and attendance labor system as well as providing more applications for inventory management at the store level using in store radio frequency systems 
seasonality our business is seasonal by nature  with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending during september  historically accounting for a large percentage of sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of slightly more than of our annual sales 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on the sales generated during these peak periods 
any decrease in sales or margins during these periods  whether as a result of economic conditions  poor weather or other factors  could have a material adverse effect on our company 

table of contents trademarks our primary trademarks and service marks are wet seal and arden b  which are registered in the us patent and trademark office 
we also use and have registered  or have applications pending for  a number of other us trademarks  including  but not limited to  accomplice  arden b sport  b 
first  b 
in  b 
rewarded  enr evolution not revolution  fit in 
stand out  formula x  get it

in general  the registrations for these trademarks and service marks are renewable indefinitely  as long as we continue to use the marks as required by applicable trademark laws 
we are not aware of any adverse claims or infringement actions relating to our trademarks or service marks 
competition the women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location and service being the principal competitive factors 
our wet seal and arden b stores compete with specialty apparel retailers  department stores and certain other apparel retailers  including aeropostale  anthropologie  abercrombie fitch  charlotte russe  gap  banana republic  h m  old navy  pacific sunwear  american eagle  target  urban outfitters  forever  express  jc penney  bebe  zara  guess and bcbg 
many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
while we believe we compete effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms  competition for prime locations within malls is intense  and we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain new locations on terms favorable to us  if at all 
customers our company s business is not dependent upon a single customer or small group of customers 
environmental matters we are not aware of any federal  state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position  or result in material capital expenditures 
however  we cannot predict the effect on our operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations 
during fiscal  there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated for fiscal government regulation our company is subject to various federal  state and local laws affecting our business 
each of our company s stores must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which the store is located 
to date  our company has not been significantly affected by any difficulty  delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 
our company is also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as employment and pay practices  overtime and working conditions 
the bulk of our company s employees are paid on an hourly basis at rates related to the federal and state minimum wages 
in the past  we have been assessed penalties or paid settlements to gain dismissal of lawsuits for non compliance with certain of these laws  and future non compliance could result in a material adverse effect on our company s operations 
in july and may  we were served with class action complaints alleging violations under certain state of california labor laws 
in november  we reached an agreement to settle the july class action complaint for approximately million  and as of february   we had accrued within accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet an amount that approximates this settlement amount 
on february   the court issued its order granting final approval of the class action settlement 
we are vigorously defending the may 
table of contents complaint and are unable to predict the likely outcome and whether such outcome may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
accordingly  no provision for a loss contingency for the may complaint has been accrued at february  our company is also subject to the fair credit reporting act the act under federal law  as well as to state laws with similar requirements  with respect to the protection our customers credit and debit card and other personal data 
the act provides in part that expiration dates may not be printed together with certain parts of the customer s account number on credit or debit card receipts given to customers 
the act imposes significant penalties upon violators of these rules and regulations if the lack of compliance is deemed to have been willful 
otherwise  damages are limited to actual losses incurred 
in january and february  we were served with two class action complaints alleging violations of the act 
the plaintiffs in the february complaint dismissed the complaint with prejudice in august on december   we reached a tentative agreement to settle the january complaint for less than million 
however  prior to the receipt of the executed settlement agreement  on february   we were named in another action  alleging the same violation  in the us district court  western district of pennsylvania 
as a result  we withdrew our offer to settle the january action noted above 
our company does not believe that it has any liability for the violations alleged in the complaints and will vigorously contest these allegations 
however  in the event we are found to have liability under the act for these allegations  significant damages could be assessed against our company  and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  any future non compliance with federal or state laws pertaining to the protection of customers personal data could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we continue to monitor our facilities for compliance with the americans with disabilities act  or the ada  in order to conform to its requirements 
under the ada  we could be required to expend funds to modify stores to better provide service to  or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of  disabled persons 
we believe that expenditures  if required  would not have a material adverse effect on our company s operations 
employees as of february   our operations had  employees  consisting of  full time employees and  part time employees 
full time personnel consisted of salaried employees and  hourly employees 
all part time personnel are hourly employees 
of all employees   were sales personnel and were administrative and distribution center personnel 
personnel at all levels of store operations are provided various opportunities for cash and or other incentives based upon various individual store sales targets 
all of our employees are non union  and  in management s opinion  are paid competitively at current industry standards 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our business the financial performance of our arden b division has been poor for several quarters and our ability to improve the financial performance of this division may not be successful 
we have experienced deterioration in the financial performance of our arden b division over the past five fiscal quarters 
the success of our arden b division is largely dependent upon our ability to offer fashion to our target customers that satisfies current fashion tastes at appropriate price points 
with the deterioration of our comparable store sales over the past several quarters we recognize that we have not met this challenge 
we have recently engaged sharon hughes as a consultant to serve as the chief merchandise officer for our arden b division and to focus on providing fashion appropriate merchandise to arden b s target customer in an attractive shopping environment 
however  to the extent that there are design and or merchandising misjudgments or a lack 
table of contents of customer traffic in arden b stores  the financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows for our arden b division will not improve and or could further worsen 
our board of directors and senior management team are continually reviewing the financial performance and the turnaround efforts involving our arden b division 
in the future  we could decide to close stores that are producing continuing financial losses or cease operations 
if we do so  we would be required to write down the carrying value of these impaired assets to realizable value  a non cash event that would negatively impact our earnings and earnings per share 
if we decide to close any stores before the expiration of the lease term  we may incur payments to landlords to terminate or buy out the remaining term of the lease 
we also may incur employee termination and inventory liquidation costs at such stores 
these costs would negatively impact our financial results and cash position 
in the last two fiscal years  we have grown our business through opening new stores 
however  in the near term we will not increase our store count and this decision may have a negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
in  we announced our desire to grow the number of stores in our chain significantly 
we noted that there was a potential to have to wet seal stores and to arden b stores 
due to difficult economic conditions generally  a need to rebuild our pipeline of potential real estate opportunities  and the weak performance of our arden b division  we do not anticipate opening any new arden b stores in fiscal and expect to open only a few new wet seal stores  net of closures during the same period 
we have redirected our focus to improving the financial performance of our existing stores and finding the correct mix of merchandise for our customers 
to the extent we are unable to improve the sales and profitability and reduce the selling expenses of our existing stores  our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows may suffer 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation 
in general  section of the internal revenue code  or section  contains provisions that may limit the availability of federal net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  to be used to offset taxable income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interests 
under section  potential limitations on nols are triggered when there has been an ownership change generally defined as a greater than change by value in our stock ownership over a three year period 
our ownership changes on april  and december  resulted in section limitations applying to nols generated prior to those dates  which were approximately million 
as a result of these ownership changes  of our million nols as of february   we may utilize up to million of our nols to offset taxable income in fiscal future transactions involving the sale or other transfer of our stock and any changes in the value of our stock may result in additional ownership changes for purposes of section the occurrence of such additional ownership changes could limit our ability to utilize our remaining nols and possibly other tax attributes 
limitations imposed on our ability to use nols and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income could cause us to pay us federal income taxes earlier than we otherwise would if such limitations were not in effect 
any further ownership change could cause such nols and other tax attributes to expire unused  thereby reducing or eliminating the benefit of such nols and other tax attributes to us and adversely affecting our future cash flow 
in recent months we have had significant changes in our senior management and these changes may impact our ability to execute our business strategy in the near term 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we appointed edmond s 
thomas as our new president and chief executive officer and promoted steven h 
benrubi  our former corporate controller  to be our new chief financial 
table of contents officer 
in addition to these changes  in february  our chief operating officer and our president of arden b merchandise resigned 
mr 
thomas  mr 
benrubi and others within management will assume the duties of our former chief operating officer  while sharon hughes will serve as chief merchandise officer for arden b under the direct supervision of mr 
thomas 
although mr 
thomas previously served as our president and chief operating officer  mr 
benrubi previously served as our vice president and corporate controller and ms 
hughes previously was an employee of our company for over a decade  we anticipate that we will experience a transition period before these individuals are fully integrated in their new roles  which could impact our ability to address the business challenges that confront our company 
we may not be successful in achieving improvements in the business and operations of our company that have been identified by our new president and chief executive officer 
since his appointment  mr 
thomas has identified several areas in which our company s business and operations can be improved 
mr 
thomas has focused on increasing comparable store sales for our retail divisions  improving our company s gross margin  enhancing in store productivity  reviving the arden b business and expanding our online business 
although mr 
thomas is highly qualified and has extensive experience in the retail industry  including with our company  we may not be able to implement our strategy in the desired time frame and or achieve the intended results and level of improvement desired by our senior management team and board of directors 
if we are unable to anticipate and react to new fashion trends  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we rely on a limited demographic customer base for a large percentage of our sales 
our brand image is dependent upon our ability to anticipate  identify and provide fresh inventory reflecting current fashion trends 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately or in a timely manner to these fashion trends  we could experience reduced consumer acceptance of our products  a diminished brand image and higher markdowns 
these factors could result in lower selling prices and sales volumes for our products  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our company s ability to attract customers to its stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping centers in which many of our stores are located 
substantially all of our stores are located in shopping centers 
factors beyond our control impact shopping center traffic  such as general economic conditions and consumer spending levels 
accordingly the slowdown in the us economy may negatively affect consumer spending and reduce shopping center traffic 
moreover  the inability of mall anchor tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores  or the decline in the popularity of malls as shopping destinations  would reduce our sales volume and  consequently  adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
we depend upon a single center for our corporate offices and distribution activities  and any significant disruption in the operation of this center could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
our corporate offices and the distribution functions for all of our stores and internet business are handled from a single  leased facility in foothill ranch  california 
in general  this area of california is subject to earthquakes and wildfires 
any significant interruption in the operation of this facility due to a natural disaster  arson  accident  system failure or other unforeseen event could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores and  consequently  lead to a decrease in sales 
the financial losses incurred may exceed our insurance for earthquake damages and business interruption costs related to any such disruption 
as a 
table of contents result  our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows could be adversely affected 
furthermore  we have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate offices and are uncertain what effect operating satellite facilities might have on our business  personnel and results of operations 
fluctuations in our results of operations for the third fiscal quarter and the fourth fiscal quarter have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income  with a disproportionate amount of our revenues and a majority of our income being generated in the third fiscal quarter back to school season  which begins the last week of july and ends during september  and the fourth fiscal quarter holiday season 
our revenues and income are generally lower during the first and second fiscal quarters 
in addition  any factors that harm our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year 
in order to prepare for our peak shopping seasons  we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry at other times of the year 
an unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown  which could reduce our net sales and gross profit 
alternatively  an unanticipated increase in demand for certain of our products could leave us unable to fulfill customer demand and result in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors  including the merchandise mix and the timing and level of inventory markdowns 
as a result  historical period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future period to period results 
you should not rely on the results of a single fiscal quarter  particularly the third fiscal quarter back to school season or fourth fiscal quarter holiday season  as an indication of our annual results or our future performance 
our failure to effectively compete with other retailers for sales and locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
the women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location and service being the principal competitive factors 
our wet seal and arden b stores compete with specialty apparel retailers  department stores and certain other apparel retailers  including aeropostale  anthropologie  abercrombie fitch  charlotte russe  gap  banana republic  h m  old navy  pacific sunwear  american eagle  target  urban outfitters  forever  express  jc penney  bebe  zara  guess and bcbg 
many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we face a variety of competitive challenges  including anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands  maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in narrowly defined market segments  developing innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors and styles that appeal to consumers in our target markets and maintaining a sufficient quantity of these items for which there is the greatest demand  obtaining favorable site locations within malls on reasonable terms  sourcing merchandise efficiently  and pricing our products competitively and achieving customer perception of value 

table of contents our industry has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace 
any of these factors could result in reductions in sales or the prices of our products which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
further  competition for prime locations and lease terms within shopping malls  in particular  is intense  and we may not be able to obtain new locations or maintain our existing locations on terms favorable to us 
the upcoming expiration of leases for approximately of our existing stores could lead to increased costs associated with renegotiating our leases and or relocating our stores 
we have approximately existing store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal in connection with the expiration of these leases  we will have to renegotiate new leases which could result in higher rental amounts for each store and landlord requirements to remodel existing locations as a condition for renewal 
although we expect to negotiate new leases with acceptable terms that will allow us to remain in a substantial majority of these locations  we may not be able to obtain new terms that are favorable to us 
in addition  as a result of renewal negotiations  we may be required by the landlord to remodel  which could result in significant capital expenditures 
in addition  some landlords may refuse to renew our leases due to our lower sales per square foot as compared with other prospective tenants 
if we are unable to agree to new terms with our landlords  we will have to relocate these stores  which could result in a significant expenditure and could lead to an interruption in the operation of our business at the affected stores  and we could be required to relocate to less desirable locations 
because of the importance of our brand names  we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we have registered trademarks for wet seal and arden b which are registered in the retail store services and other classes 
we take actions to establish and protect our intellectual property 
however  others may infringe on our intellectual property rights or seek to block the sale of our products as violative of their intellectual property rights 
if we are required to stop using any of our registered or non registered trademarks  our sales could decline and  consequently  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
covenants contained in agreements governing our existing indebtedness restrict the manner in which we conduct our business  and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  growth prospects and ability to procure merchandise for our stores 
our senior revolving credit facility and the indenture  as amended  governing our secured convertible notes contain covenants that restrict the manner in which we conduct our business 
subject to certain exceptions including an exception to permit limited stock repurchases  these covenants restrict our ability to  among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness  make investments or acquisitions  merge  consolidate  dissolve or liquidate  engage in certain asset sales including the sale of stock  repurchase stock  grant liens on assets  pay dividends  and close stores 

table of contents a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing our existing indebtedness  acceleration of any amounts then outstanding  the foreclosure upon collateral securing the debt obligations  or the unavailability of the lines of credit 
we do not authenticate the license rights of our suppliers 
we purchase merchandise from a number of vendors who purport to hold manufacturing and distribution rights under the terms of license agreements or that assert their products are not subject to any restrictions as to distribution 
we generally rely upon each vendor s representation concerning those manufacturing and distribution rights and do not independently verify whether each vendor legally holds adequate rights to the licensed properties they are manufacturing or distributing 
if we acquire unlicensed merchandise or merchandise violating a registered trademark  we could be obligated to remove it from our stores  incur costs associated with destruction of the merchandise if the vendor is unwilling or unable to reimburse us and be subject to civil and criminal liability 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
we are subject to risks associated with our procurement of products from non us based vendors and non us vendors that purchase products internationally  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
a portion of our products is manufactured outside the united states 
as a result  we are susceptible to greater losses as a result of a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors beyond our control  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
these factors include import or trade restrictions including increased tariffs  customs duties  taxes or quotas imposed by the united states government in respect of the foreign countries in which our products are currently manufactured or any of the countries in which our products may be manufactured in the future  political instability or acts of terrorism  significant fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies  restrictions on the transfer of funds between the united states and foreign jurisdictions  and or potential disruption of imports due to labor disputes at us ports  any of which could adversely affect our merchandise flow and  consequently  cause our sales to decline  and local business practices that do not conform to our legal or ethical guidelines 
our imports are limited by textile agreements between the united states and a number of foreign jurisdictions  including hong kong  china  taiwan and south korea 
these agreements impose quotas on the amounts and types of merchandise that may be imported into the united states from these countries 
these agreements also allow the united states to limit the importation of categories of merchandise that are not now subject to specified limits 
the united states and the countries in which our products are produced or sold may also  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty or tariff levels 
in addition  none of our international suppliers or international manufacturers supplies or manufactures our products exclusively 
as a result  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers and import quota capacity 
if we were unable to obtain our raw materials and finished apparel from the countries where we wish to purchase them  either because room under the necessary quotas was unavailable or for any other reason  or if the cost of doing so should increase  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
violation of labor laws and practices by our suppliers could harm our business and results of operations 
our company s policy is to use only those sourcing agents and independent manufacturers who operate in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the violation of laws  particularly labor laws  by an 
table of contents independent manufacturer  or by one of the sourcing agents  or the divergence of an independent manufacturer s or sourcing agent s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the united states or in the country in which the manufacturing facility is located  and the public revelation of those illegal or unethical practices  could cause significant damage to our company s reputation 
although our manufacturer operating guidelines promote ethical business practices  we do not control the business and operations of the manufacturers and cannot guarantee their legal and regulatory compliance 
we are exposed to business risks as a result of our internet operations 
we operate online stores at www 
wetseal 
com and www 
ardenb 
com 
our internet operations are subject to numerous risks  including online security breaches and or credit card fraud  reliance on third party software providers  and diversion of sales from our retail stores 
in addition  increased internet sales by our competitors could result in increased price competition and decreased margins 
our inability to effectively address these risks and any other risks that we face in connection with our internet operations could adversely affect the profitability of our internet operations 
three lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of the fair credit reporting act 
in fiscal and fiscal  we were served with a total of three class action complaints alleging violations of the fair credit reporting act one of the complaints was dismissed in august 
the act provides in part that portions of the credit card number may not be printed together with expiration dates on credit or debit card receipts given to customers 
the act currently imposes significant penalties upon violators of these rules and regulations where the violation is deemed to have been willful 
otherwise damages are limited to actual losses incurred by the card holder 
we do not believe that we have any liability for the violations alleged in the complaints and will vigorously contest these allegations 
moreover  there is pending legislation in congress that would modify the definition of a willful violation in a manner favorable to our company 
however  in the event we are found to have liability under the act for these allegations  significant damages could be assessed against our company  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as consumer perception of our company 
our retail store operations are affected by local  regional and national economic conditions 
our business is sensitive to consumer spending patterns and preferences 
various economic conditions affect the level of spending on the merchandise we offer  including general business conditions  interest rates  taxation  the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
our sales and profitability may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions on a local  regional or national level 
risks related to our common stock our stockholders may experience dilution due to conversions and exercises of outstanding convertible securities and or the anti dilution protection of the securities 
since may  we have completed private placements of class a common stock and warrants  convertible notes and shares of preferred stock that are convertible into or exercisable for shares of class a common stock 
through february   we have issued  shares of our class a common stock as a result of these private placements and exercises and conversions of these securities 
an additional  shares of class a common stock may be issued under the convertible notes  preferred stock and warrants that remain outstanding  
table of contents and this number of shares of class a common stock is subject to anti dilution adjustments based upon the anti dilution provisions contained in these instruments 
the issuance of the additional shares of class a common stock upon conversion and exercise could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline 
the price of our class a common stock has fluctuated significantly during the past few years and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
our class a common stock  which is traded on the nasdaq global market  has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
the market price of our class a common stock is likely to fluctuate  both because of actual and perceived changes in our operating results and prospects and because of general volatility in the stock market 
the market price of our class a common stock could continue to fluctuate widely in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  including comparable store sales  the addition or loss of suppliers  customers and other business relationships  changes in financial estimates of  and recommendations by  securities analysts  conditions or trends in the apparel and consumer products industries  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of our class a common stock  general market and economic conditions  and other events or factors  including the realization of any of the risks described in this risk factors section  many of which are beyond our control 
fluctuations in the price and trading volume of our class a common stock in response to factors such as those set forth above could be unrelated or disproportionate to our actual operating performance 
we have never paid dividends on our class a common stock and do not plan to do so in the future 
holders of shares of our class a common stock are entitled to receive any dividends that may be declared by our board of directors 
however  we have not paid any cash dividends on our class a common stock and we do not expect to for the foreseeable future 
also  our agreements with our senior lenders and the indenture governing our notes restrict the payment of dividends to our stockholders 
our charter provisions and delaware law may have anti takeover effects 
our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to designate and issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that could differentially and adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our class a common stock  which could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
furthermore  certain provisions of delaware law applicable to our company could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
the possible issuance of preferred stock and the application of anti takeover provisions of delaware law could each have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest  making the acquisition of a substantial block of class a common stock more difficult and limiting the price that investors might in the future be willing to pay for shares of our class a common stock

executive overview we are a national specialty retailer operating stores selling fashionable and contemporary apparel and accessory items designed for female customers aged to we operate two nationwide  primarily mall based  chains of retail stores under the names wet seal and arden b 
at february   we had retail stores in states  puerto rico and washington dc of the stores  there were wet seal stores and arden b stores 
we report our results of operations as two reportable segments representing our two retail divisions wet seal and arden b 
internet operations for wet seal and arden b are included in their respective operating segments 
although the two operating segments are similar in their products  production processes  distribution methods and regulatory environment  in fiscal  due to the poor profit performance of the arden b division and the disparity in financial performance between the two segments  we concluded that we no longer consider these operating segments to be economically similar 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to the end of january 
fiscal includes weeks of operations and fiscal and fiscal each include weeks of operations 
we consider the following to be key performance indicators in evaluating our performance comparable store sales for purposes of measuring comparable store sales  sales include merchandise sales as well as membership fee revenues recognized under our wet seal division s frequent buyer program during the applicable period 
stores are deemed comparable stores on the first day of the month following the one year anniversary of their opening or significant remodel relocation  which we define to be a square footage increase or decrease of at least 
stores that are remodeled or relocated with a resulting square footage change of less than are maintained in the comparable store base with no interruption 
however  stores that are closed for four or more days in a fiscal month  due to remodel  relocation or other reasons  are removed from the comparable store base that fiscal month as well as for the comparable fiscal month in the following fiscal year 
comparable store sales results are important in achieving operating leverage on certain expenses such as store payroll  occupancy  depreciation and amortization  general and administrative expenses  and other costs that are at least partially fixed 
positive comparable store sales results generate greater operating leverage on expenses 
table of contents while negative comparable store sales results negatively affect operating leverage 
comparable store sales results also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash  and working capital 
average transaction counts we consider the trend in the average number of sales transactions occurring in our stores to be a key performance metric 
to the extent we are able to increase transaction counts in our stores that more than offset any decrease in the average dollar sale per transaction  we will generate increases in our comparable store sales 
gross margins we analyze the components of gross margin  specifically cumulative mark on  markups  markdowns  shrink  buying costs  distribution costs  and store occupancy costs 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups  a significant increase in our use of markdowns or in inventory shrink  or an inability to generate sufficient sales leverage on other components of cost of sales could have an adverse impact on our gross margin results and results of operations 
operating income loss we view operating income loss as a key indicator of our financial success 
the key drivers of operating income loss are comparable store sales  gross margins  and the changes we experience in operating costs 
cash flow and liquidity working capital we evaluate cash flow from operations  liquidity and working capital to determine our short term operational financing needs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  some of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
our accounting policies and estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the policies and estimates discussed below involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies that are material to our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we have certain accounting policies that require more significant management judgment and estimates than others 
these include our accounting policies with respect to revenue recognition  merchandise inventories  long lived assets  impairment of goodwill  stock based compensation  income taxes  insurance reserves and derivative financial instruments 
revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchases by customers at our retail store locations 
taxes collected from our customers are and have been recorded on a net basis 
for online sales  revenue is recognized at the estimated time goods are received by customers 
based upon an analysis completed by us during the first fiscal quarter of  customers typically receive goods within four days of being shipped versus a previously estimated five to seven days 
this change in estimate did not have a significant effect on the amount of revenue recognized for online sales during fiscal shipping and handling fees billed to customers for online sales are included in net sales 
we have recorded accruals to estimate sales returns by customers based on historical sales return results 
a customer generally may return merchandise within days of the original purchase date 
actual return 
table of contents rates have historically been within management s estimates and the accruals established 
as the accrual for merchandise returns is based on estimates  the actual returns could differ from the accrual  which could impact net sales 
the accrual for merchandise returns is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at february   and february   respectively 
for fiscal  and  shipping and handling fee revenues were million  million  and million  respectively 
we recognize the sales from gift cards  gift certificates and store credits as they are redeemed for merchandise 
prior to redemption  we maintain an unearned revenue liability for gift cards  gift certificates and store credits until we are released from such liability  which includes consideration of potential obligations arising from state escheatment laws 
our gift cards  gift certificates and store credits do not have expiration dates  however  over time  a percentage of gift cards  gift certificates and store credits are not redeemed or recovered breakage 
historically  due to the lack of sufficient historical redemption trend data  we had not recognized breakage on gift cards  gift certificates and store credits 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we analyzed company specific historical redemption patterns and determined that the likelihood of redemption of unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates and store credits three years after their issuance is remote 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adjusted our unearned revenue liability to recognize estimated unredeemed amounts and recorded breakage as additional sales for gift cards  gift certificates and store credits that remained unredeemed three years after their issuance 
our net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal included a benefit for an adjustment of million to reduce our unearned revenue liability for estimated unredeemed amounts 
the unearned revenue for gift cards  gift certificates and store credits is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at february  and february   respectively 
if actual redemptions ultimately differ from the assumptions underlying our breakage adjustments  or our future experience indicates the likelihood of redemption of gift cards  gift certificates and store credits becomes remote at a different point in time after issuance  we may recognize further significant adjustments to our accruals for such unearned revenue  which could have a significant effect on our net sales and results of operations 
we maintain a frequent buyer program through our wet seal division 
under the program  customers receive a to discount on all purchases made during a twelve month period and are provided off coupons that may be used on purchases during such period 
the annual membership fee of is non refundable 
we have historically recognized membership fee revenue under the frequent buyer program on a straight line basis over the twelve month membership period due to a lack of sufficient program history to determine customer usage patterns 
during november  we changed from in store delivery to e mail delivery of the program s off coupons  which eliminated the customer s ability to use such coupons at the time of initial purchases 
we believe this change will affect customer usage patterns 
we also continue to test alternative program structures  and promotions tied to the program  and may decide to further modify the program in ways that could also affect customer usage patterns 
as a result of the recent program change and potential further modifications  we believe it is appropriate to maintain straight line recognition of membership fee revenue 
we may  in the future  determine that recognition of membership fee revenue on a different basis is appropriate  which would affect net sales 
discounts received by customers on purchases using the frequent buyer program are recognized at the time of such purchases 
the unearned revenue for this program is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at february  and february   respectively 
we maintain a customer loyalty program through our arden b division 
under the program  customers accumulate points based on purchase activity 
once a loyalty program member achieves a certain point level  the member earns awards that may be redeemed for merchandise 
merchandise redemptions are accrued as unearned revenue and recorded as a reduction of net sales as points are accumulated by the member 

table of contents during fiscal  we modified the terms of the arden b loyalty program with respect to the number of points required to earn an award and the value of awards when earned 
at the time of the program change  we also established expiration terms i for prospectively earned awards of two months from the date the award is earned and ii for pre existing awards of either two or twelve months from the program change date 
this resulted in a reduction to our estimate of ultimate award redemptions under the program 
additionally  during fiscal  we further reduced our estimate of ultimate redemptions based upon lower than anticipated redemption levels under the program s revised terms 
as a result  in fiscal  we recorded a benefit of million  which was recorded as an increase to net sales and a decrease to accrued liabilities 
during fiscal  we further modified the terms of the arden b loyalty program whereby  quarterly  we convert into fractional awards the points accumulated by customers who have not made purchases within the preceding months 
similar to all other awards currently being granted under the program  such fractional awards expire if unredeemed after days 
the unearned revenue for this program is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at february  and february   respectively 
if actual redemptions ultimately differ from accrued redemption levels  or if we further modify the terms of the program in a way that affects expected redemption value and levels  we could record adjustments to the unearned revenue accrual  which would affect net sales 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price 
cost is calculated using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  inventory is stated at its current retail selling value and then is converted to a cost basis by applying a cost to retail ratio based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and estimates  such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins 
markdowns are recorded when the sales value of the inventory has diminished 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
when a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise  the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
total markdowns on a cost basis in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively  and represented   and of net sales  respectively 
we accrued million and million for planned but unexecuted markdowns as of february   and february   respectively 
to the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may be required that could reduce our gross margin  operating income and the carrying value of inventories 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to anticipate the changing fashion tastes of our customers and to respond to those changing tastes in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changing styles  trends or brand preferences of our customers  we may experience lower sales  excess inventories and more frequent and extensive markdowns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important that could trigger an impairment review include a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or 
table of contents forecast that demonstrates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
this evaluation is performed based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows from operating activities compared with the carrying value of the related assets 
if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized  measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets  with such estimated fair values determined using the best information available  generally the discounted estimated future cash flows of the assets using a rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
quarterly  we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
during fiscal  and  we determined such events or changes in circumstances had occurred with respect to certain of our retail stores  and that operating losses or insufficient operating income would likely continue 
as such  we recorded non cash charges of million  million and million  respectively  in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal  and to write down the carrying value of these stores long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
the estimation of future cash flows from operating activities requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth and gross margin performance 
if our sales growth  gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level  or inflation exceeds our forecast and we are unable to recover such costs through price increases  the carrying value of certain of our retail stores may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment no less frequently than annually  and also may test on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not impairment may have occurred 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of a reporting unit 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows  comparable sales or valuations of other retail businesses 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the most significant assumptions we use in this analysis are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we use assumptions for items such as comparable store sales  store count growth rates  the rate of inflation and the discount rate we consider to represent our weighted average cost of capital and or the market discount rate for acquisitions of retail businesses 
if our assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of our goodwill may ultimately prove to be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has occurred 
based on our analysis performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which considered the deteriorating operating performance of the arden b division and our resulting outlook for that business  we wrote off the entire million carrying value of our goodwill  which was directly associated with the arden b division 
this charge is included in asset impairment in our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result  no goodwill remains on our consolidated balance sheet as of february  based on analyses performed in fiscal and  we determined that no impairments of goodwill had occurred 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no

sfas no 
r supersedes our previous accounting methodology using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  
table of contents accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the intrinsic value method  stock based compensation associated with stock options and awards was determined as the difference  if any  between the fair market value of the related common stock on the measurement date and the price an employee must pay to exercise the award 
accordingly  stock based compensation expense had been recognized for restricted stock grants as well as for stock options that were granted at prices that were below the fair market value of the related stock at the measurement date 
we adopted sfas no

under this method  compensation expense recognized includes a compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no

the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool the apic pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee and director share based awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas no

we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options granted to employees 
we use these values to recognize stock compensation expense for stock options in accordance with sfas no 
r 
the black scholes model is complex and requires significant exercise of judgment to estimate future common stock dividend yield  common stock expected volatility  and the expected life of the stock options 
these assumptions significantly affect our stock option valuations  and future changes in these assumptions could significantly change valuations of future stock option grants and  thus  affect future stock compensation expense 
in addition  if circumstances were to change such that we determined stock options values were better represented by an alternative valuation method  such change could also significantly affect future stock compensation expense 
we also apply the black scholes and monte carlo simulation models to value performance shares granted to employees and consultants 
use of the black scholes model for this purpose requires the same exercise of judgment noted above 
the monte carlo simulation model is also complex and requires significant exercise of judgment to estimate expected returns on our common stock  expected common stock volatility and our maximum expected share value during applicable vesting periods 
this valuation approach also requires us to estimate a marketability discount in consideration of trading restrictions on performance share grants 
we currently believe monte carlo simulation provides the most relevant value of performance share grants as the simulation allows for vesting throughout the vesting period and includes an assumption for equity returns over time  while the black scholes method does not 
as the monte carlo simulation provides a more precise estimate of fair value  we have used that approach to value our performance shares for accounting purposes 

table of contents the assumptions we use to value our performance shares significantly affect the resulting values used for accounting purposes 
accordingly  changes in these assumptions could significantly change valuations and  thus  affect future stock compensation expense 
in addition  if circumstances were to change such that we determined performance share values were better represented by the black scholes model or an alternative valuation method  and such changes resulted in a significant change in the value of performance shares  such changes could also significantly affect future stock compensation 
the following table summarizes stock based compensation recorded in the consolidated statements of operations  including charges of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  associated with merchandising consultant performance shares granted to the merchandising consultant as discussed further below under the heading merchandising consultant february  february  january  in thousands cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses stock based compensation accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as a result of disappointing sales results during the back to school season and our historical operating losses  management concluded during fiscal that it was more likely than not that we would not realize our net deferred tax assets 
as a result of this conclusion  we reduced to zero our net deferred tax assets by establishing a tax valuation allowance of million in fiscal in addition  we have discontinued recognizing income tax benefits in the consolidated statements of operations until it is determined that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
as of february   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million  of which million relates to benefits from the exercise of stock options for which the associated valuation allowance reversal will be recorded to paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheets if and when reversed 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in the entire net operating loss carryforward of million is subject to annual utilization limitations as of february  as of february   we also had federal charitable contribution carryforwards of million  which begin to expire in  alternative minimum tax credits of million  which do not expire  and state net operating loss carryforwards of million  which begin to expire in and are also subject to annual utilization limitations 
section of the internal revenue code section contains provisions that may limit the availability of federal net operating loss carryforwards to be used to offset taxable income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interests 
under section  an ownership change that triggers potential limitations on net operating loss carryforwards occurs when there has been a greater than change in ownership interest by shareholders owning or more of a company over a period of three years or less 
based on our analysis  we had ownership changes on april  and december   which resulted in section limitations applying to federal net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to that date  which were approximately million 
as a result of these ownership changes  of our million of remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards  we may utilize up to approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards to 
table of contents offset taxable income in fiscal we may also experience additional ownership changes  as defined by section  in the future which could further limit the amount of federal net operating loss carryforwards annually available 
we may also generate income in future periods on a federal alternative minimum tax basis  which would result in alternative minimum taxes payable on a portion of such income 
in addition  we may determine that varying state laws with respect to net operating loss carryforward utilization may result in lower limits  or an inability to utilize loss carryforwards in some states altogether  which could result in our incurring additional state income taxes 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
we were subject to the provisions of fin as of february  the adoption of fin had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
at february   we had less than million in unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods 
we are currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments  accruals or material deviations from our recognized tax positions 
however  if we later identify other income tax issues that result in significant additional payments or necessary accruals  this could have a material adverse effect on our reported results 
insurance reserves we are partially self insured for our workers compensation and group health plans 
under the workers compensation insurance program  we are liable for a deductible of million for each individual claim and an aggregate annual liability of million 
under our group health plan  we are liable for a deductible of million for each claim and an aggregate monthly liability of million 
the monthly aggregate liability is subject to adjustment based on the number of participants in the plan each month 
for both of the insurance plans  we record a liability for the costs associated with reported claims and a projected estimate for unreported claims considering historical experience and industry standards 
we will continue to adjust the estimates as the actual experience dictates 
a significant change in the number or dollar amount of claims could cause us to revise our estimate of potential losses and affect our reported results 
derivative financial instruments we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative financial instruments be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
as of february   our only derivative financial instrument was an embedded derivative associated with our secured convertible notes 
the gain or loss as a result of the change in fair value of this embedded derivative is recognized in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations each period 
during fiscal and  there were decreases of million and million  respectively  in the fair value of our embedded derivative 
in fiscal  the fair value of our embedded derivative increased million 
we apply the black scholes and monte carlo simulation models to value this embedded derivative 
in applying the black scholes and monte carlo simulation models  changes and volatility in our common stock price  and changes in risk free interest rates  our expected dividend yield and expected returns on our common stock could significantly affect the fair value of this derivative instrument  which could then result in significant charges or credits to interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents we have determined that value is best represented by a blend of valuation outcomes under black scholes modeling and monte carlo simulation 
in addition to the estimate changes noted above  if circumstances were to change such that we determined that the embedded derivative value was better represented by an alternative valuation method  and such changes resulted in a significant change in the value of the embedded derivative  such changes could also significantly affect future interest expense 
current trends and outlook our consolidated comparable store sales decreased for fiscal  driven by a increase in comparable store sales in our wet seal division offset by an decrease in comparable store sales in our arden b division 
this decline was due primarily to the continued softness in average store transaction counts and lower than anticipated full priced selling at our arden b division 
we believe these overall trends may continue through at least the first half of fiscal and are planning our merchandise inventories and managing our costs with this expectation entering the spring season 
we anticipate a high single digit comparable store sales percentage decline for the fiscal first quarter of  driven primarily by a significantly greater comparable store sales decline in our arden b division as we continue efforts to improve merchandise content in that division  partially offset by a lesser comparable store sales decline in our wet seal division 
during the four weeks ended march  and the five weeks ended april   we experienced comparable store sales declines  on a consolidated basis  of and  respectively 
our long term strategy is to expand our existing retail store base  return to positive comparable store sales growth  revive the arden b business and expand our online business 
we are also taking several steps to drive higher sales productivity in our retail stores  including improved store layout and visual displays  and have embarked on several initiatives to improve gross margins  including efforts to optimize sourcing of merchandise  enhance our inventory planning and allocation functions  better align merchandise mix with customer wants  rationalize our vendor base and improve supply chain efficiency through better coordination among and within our vendor  internal distribution and store operations organizations 
our operating performance since fiscal has resulted in increased liquidity and improved credit standing with suppliers 
however  we may experience continued declines in comparable store sales or may be unsuccessful in executing some or all of our business strategy 
if our comparable store sales drop significantly for an extended period of time  or we falter in execution of our business strategy  we may not achieve our financial performance goals  which could impact our results of operations and operating cash flow  and we may be forced to seek alternatives to address cash constraints  including seeking debt and or equity financing 
store openings and closures during fiscal  we opened and closed ten wet seal stores and opened seven and closed four arden b stores 
we believe future closures for at least the next months will primarily result from lease expirations where we decide not to extend  or are unable to extend  a store lease 
we expect net store growth to remain flat  or grow nominally  net of closings  during fiscal credit extensions prior to our recapitalization and financing transactions in fiscal and  we experienced a tight credit environment 
credit extended to us by vendors  factors  and others for merchandise and services was extremely limited 
this credit tightening required us to issue letters of credit outside of the ordinary course of business  or  in many instances  shorten vendor credit terms 
the lack of credit created a considerable need for working capital 
our improving sales trend  the completion of financing transactions in fiscal and  and our improved operating results in fiscal  and have significantly improved our cash position and liquidity profile 
as a result  we achieved improvements in credit terms with several vendors in fiscal  and 
table of contents we believe  but cannot provide assurance  that we could now obtain longer credit terms with additional vendors 
however  we continue to maintain shorter credit terms in order to take advantage of favorable purchase discounts 
merchandising consultant from late through the end of fiscal  we used the assistance of a consultant with our merchandising initiatives for our wet seal division 
on july   we entered into a related consulting agreement that expired on january   and an associated stock award agreement that expired on january  under the terms of the consulting agreement and stock award agreement  we recorded charges of million and million in non cash stock compensation  and million and million in cash charges  within general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during fiscal and  respectively 
we incurred no stock compensation or cash charges associated with this agreement during fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal year indicated

cost of sales increased  in dollars  due primarily to the increase in net sales and an increase in occupancy costs due to our increase in store count 
cost of sales increased as a percentage of net sales due primarily to a decrease in merchandise margin as a percentage of sales 
the merchandise margin decreased due to an increase in markdown rates  which resulted from additional promotional activity and permanent markdowns in the third and fourth fiscal quarters in response to the competitive retail environment  partially offset by higher initial markup rates compared to the prior year

however  these increases  in dollars  were partially offset by the following decreases a million decrease in store and field travel costs  a million decrease in store supply costs  and a million decrease in field support bonuses based upon our financial performance relative to bonus targets 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million from the prior year to million 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were  or basis points lower  than a year ago 
the following contributed to the current year decrease in general and administrative expenses a decrease in charges associated with the expiration at the end of fiscal of the july merchandising consultant agreement of million  which resulted in prior year stock and cash compensation charges of million and million  respectively  versus no expense in fiscal  
table of contents a million severance charge in the prior year related to a former executive  a decrease of million in legal fees due primarily to a million insurance reimbursement and settlement  and a general decrease in the level of legal services  and a million decrease in corporate bonus based on our financial performance relative to bonus targets 
however  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by the following increases a million charge associated with a separation agreement upon departure of our former chief executive officer  a million increase in recruiting fees  primarily associated with our search for a new chief executive officer  and a million increase in corporate payroll due to achievement of full staffing in several corporate support functions 
store closure adjustments costs change from prior fiscal year in millions store closure adjustments costs percentage of net sales as a result of decreases in estimated costs for lease terminations  due primarily to settlement agreements and a decrease in estimated legal and other costs  during fiscal  we recognized a million credit to store closure costs

accordingly  we reduced their respective carrying values to their estimated fair market values  as well as wrote down the value of certain capital additions made to previously impaired stores 
we incurred non cash charges of million to write down these stores to their respective fair values 
additionally  based on our annual goodwill analysis  which considered the deteriorating operating performance of our arden b division and our resulting outlook for that business  we wrote off the entire million carrying value of our goodwill  which was directly associated with the arden b division

provision for income taxes change from prior fiscal year in millions provision for income taxes in fiscal  we had net operating loss carryforwards available  subject to certain limitation  to offset our regular taxable income 
we recognized a provision for income taxes that resulted in effective tax rates of for federal income taxes and for state income taxes 
these effective rates are based on the portion of our estimated alternative minimum taxable income for fiscal that cannot be offset by net operating loss carryforwards 
we ceased recognizing tax benefits related to our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets beginning with our second quarter of fiscal  and we currently recognize the tax benefits associated with our deferred tax assets only when they are realized 
in fiscal and fiscal  we had sufficient net operating loss carryforwards available to fully offset taxable income generated in both fiscal years 
in fiscal  despite our loss before provision for income taxes  due primarily to the non deductibility for tax purposes of the interest expense associated with our secured convertible notes  we generated taxable income 
however  under federal tax law  we are permitted to use net

the increase in fiscal was due primarily to a increase in the average dollar sale  partially offset by a decrease in the number of transaction counts per store 
the increase in the average dollar sale resulted from a increase in our average unit retail prices  somewhat offset by a decrease in units purchased per customer 
the overall net sales increase was attributable to the increase in number of stores open  from stores as february  to stores as of february   a million increase in net sales in our internet business  and a million benefit of recording breakage for unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates and store credits in fiscal  which are not factors in calculating our comparable store sales 
wet seal s operating income increased to of net sales in fiscal  from in fiscal the increase in operating income was due primarily to improved merchandise margins as a result of higher initial markup rates compared to prior year  partially offset by increase in markdown rates  as a result of the additional promotional activity and permanent markdowns in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal in response to the competitive retail environment 
this favorable impact from merchandise margins was partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs resulting from the deleveraging effect from having only a slight increase in comparable store sales  and million of pre opening costs for our new stores opened in fiscal  associated with stores under construction and or opened during the period  versus million of such costs incurred in the prior year 
in addition  cash and non cash stock compensation charges of million and million  respectively  were recorded in fiscal associated with the merchandising consultant engaged to assist with our merchandising initiatives versus no such charges being incurred in fiscal

under our senior revolving credit facility  we are subject to borrowing base limitations on the amount that can be borrowed and certain customary covenants  including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make investments and acquisitions  grant liens  pay dividends  close stores and dispose of assets  subject to certain exceptions 
our ability to borrow and request the issuance of letters of credit is subject to the requirement that we maintain an excess of the borrowing base over the outstanding credit extensions of not less than million 
the interest rate on our line of credit under the senior revolving credit facility is the prime rate or  if we elect  the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin ranging from to 
the applicable libor margin is based on the level of average excess availability  as defined under our senior revolving credit facility  at the time of election  as adjusted quarterly 
the applicable libor margin was as of february  we also incur fees on outstanding letters of credit under the senior revolving credit facility in effect at a rate equal to the applicable libor margin for standby letters of credit and of the applicable libor margin for commercial letters of credit

at february   we were in compliance with all covenant requirements in the senior revolving credit facility 
we believe we will have sufficient cash and credit availability to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may experience continued declines in consolidated comparable store sales or experience other events that negatively affect our operating results 
if our consolidated comparable store sales drop significantly for an extended period of time  or we falter in execution of our business strategy  we may not achieve our financial performance goals  which could impact our results of operations and

this could also cause a decrease in or elimination of excess availability under the facility  which could force us to seek alternatives to address cash constraints  including seeking additional debt and or equity financing 
seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal in nature  with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending during september  historically accounting for a large percentage of our sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of slightly more than of our annual sales 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
however  we cannot be certain that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future

recently adopted accounting pronouncements effective february   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the cumulative effect  if any  of applying fin is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit in the year of adoption 
fin also requires that  subsequent to initial adoption  a change in judgment that results in subsequent recognition  derecognition or change in a measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period including any related interest and penalties be recognized as a discrete item in the period in which the change occurs 
fin also requires expanded disclosures  including identification of tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months  a description of tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdiction  a tabular reconciliation of the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of each annual reporting period  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate and the total amounts of interest and penalties recognized in the statements of operations and financial position 
the adoption of fin had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
at february   we had less than million in unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods 
we are currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments  accruals or material deviations from our recognized tax positions 
effective upon adoption of fin  we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties within our provision for income taxes 
we had no such interest and penalties accrued at february  prior to our adoption of fin  we recognized such interest and penalties  which were immaterial in prior periods  within general and administrative expenses 
the major jurisdictions in which we file income tax returns include the united states federal jurisdiction as well as various state jurisdictions within the united states 
our fiscal year and thereafter are subject to examination by the united states federal jurisdiction  and  generally  fiscal year and thereafter are subject to examination by various state tax authorities 
in may  the fasb issued fsp no 
fin fsp  definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 
fsp amended fin to provide guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 
fsp required application upon the initial adoption of fin the adoption of fsp did not affect our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached in eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the eitf reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure 
eitf issue no 
was effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december  taxes collected from our customers are and have been recorded on a net basis 
we did not modify this accounting policy

new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
provides a new single authoritative definition of fair value and provides enhanced guidance for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and requires additional disclosures related to the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
adoption of sfas no 
is required as of the beginning of fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued fsp nos 
and which partially deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities and removed certain leasing transactions from its scope 
we have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
provides companies with an option to report many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
the fasb believes that sfas no 
helps to mitigate accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities  and would require entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the new statement does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
adoption of sfas no 
is required as of the beginning of fiscal years beginning after november  we do not intend to apply the fair value option to any of our assets or liabilities upon adoption of sfas no 
and  accordingly  do not believe adoption of sfas no 
will have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r 
the objective of sfas no 
r is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a company provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
under sfas no 
r  a company is required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration measured at their fair value at the acquisition date 
it further required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that have no alternative future use to be measured at their acquisition date fair value and then immediately charged to expense  and that acquisition related costs are to be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred 
among other changes  this statement also required that negative goodwill be recognized in earnings as a gain attributable to the acquisition  and any deferred tax benefits resulting from a business combination be recognized in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  currently  we do not believe adoption of sfas no 
r will have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
however  sfas no 
r could affect how we account for business acquisitions occurring after its adoption date 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 

the objective of this statement is to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a company provides in its consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
requires a company to clearly identify and present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but separate from the company s equity 
it also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income  changes in ownership interest to be accounted for similarly  as equity transactions  and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary to be measured at fair value

will have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

the objective of sfas no 
is to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
we have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
additional information regarding new accounting pronouncements is contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to the extent that we borrow under our senior revolving credit facility  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
at february   no borrowings were outstanding under the senior revolving credit facility 
as of february   we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments  except as discussed in market risk change in value of our common stock immediately below 
we contract for and settle all purchases in us dollars  and in fiscal we directly imported only approximately of our merchandise inventories 
thus  we consider the effect of currency rate changes to be indirect and  given the small amount of imported product  we believe the effect of a major shift in currency exchange rates would be insignificant to our results 
market risk change in value of our common stock our secured convertible notes see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contain an embedded derivative  which upon the occurrence of a change of control  as defined  allows each note holder the option to require us to redeem all or a portion of the notes at a price equal to the greater of i the product of x the conversion amount being redeemed and y the quotient determined by dividing a the closing sale price of our class a common stock on the business day on which the first public announcement of such proposed change of control is made by b the conversion price and ii of the conversion amount being redeemed 
we account for this derivative at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets within other long term liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we determine the fair value of the derivative instrument each period using a combination of the black scholes model and the monte carlo simulation model 
such models are complex and require significant judgments in the estimation of fair values in the absence of quoted market prices 
changes in the fair market value of the derivative liability are recognized in earnings 

table of contents in applying the black scholes and monte carlo simulation models  changes and volatility in our common stock price  and changes in risk free interest rates  our expected dividend yield and expected returns on our common stock could significantly affect the fair value of this derivative instrument  which could then result in significant charges or credits to interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal  there was a million increase in the fair value of this derivative  which we recognized as an increase to the carrying value of the derivative liability and a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations
