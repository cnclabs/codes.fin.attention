item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with part i  including matters set forth in the risk factors section of this form k  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented 
overview autonation  inc  through its subsidiaries  is the largest automotive retailer in the united states 
as of december   we owned and operated new vehicle franchises from dealerships located in major metropolitan markets  predominantly in the sunbelt region of the united states 
our stores  which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets  sell different brands of new vehicles 
the core brands of vehicles that we sell  representing approximately of the new vehicles that we sold in  are manufactured by toyota  ford  general motors  honda  nissan  chrysler  daimler  and bmw 
we operate in a single operating and reporting segment  automotive retailing 
we offer a diversified range of automotive products and services  including new vehicles  used vehicles  vehicle maintenance and repair services  vehicle parts  extended service contracts  vehicle protection products  and other aftermarket products 
we also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources 
we believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by  among other things  leveraging our market brands and advertising  improving asset management  implementing standardized processes  and increasing productivity across all of our stores 
for the year ended december   new vehicle sales account for approximately of our total revenue  but approximately of our total gross margin 
our parts and service and finance and insurance operations  while comprising approximately of total revenue  contribute approximately of our gross margin 
we believe that many factors affect sales of new vehicles and retailers gross profit margins in the united states and in our particular geographic markets  including the economy  inflation  recession or economic slowdown  consumer confidence  housing markets  fuel prices  credit availability  the level of manufacturers production capacity  manufacturer incentives and consumers reaction to such offers  intense industry competition  interest rates  the prospects of war  other international conflicts or terrorist attacks  severe weather conditions  the level of personal discretionary spending  product quality  affordability and innovation  employment unemployment rates  the number of consumers whose vehicle leases are expiring  and the length of consumer loans on existing vehicles 
changes in interest rates could significantly impact industry new vehicle sales and vehicle affordability  due to the direct relationship between interest rates and monthly loan payments  a critical factor for many vehicle buyers  and the impact interest rates can have on customers borrowing capacity and disposable income 
sales of certain new vehicles  particularly larger trucks and sports utility vehicles that historically have provided us with higher gross margins  also are impacted by fuel prices 
the automotive retail environment was challenging in  especially in california and florida  where the housing markets experienced a significant decline 
for  we anticipate that the automotive retail market will remain challenging and that full year industry new vehicle sales will decline from the low million unit level in to the mid million unit level 
however  actual sales may materially differ 
we had net income from continuing operations of million in and million in and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of in and the results included favorable tax adjustments of million  or 
per share 
the results included pre tax charges of million  or 
per share  for the debt tender premium and other financing costs relating to our april recapitalization 
our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program in april and an additional million share repurchase program in october we repurchased million shares of 
table of contents our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million average purchase price per share of during the year ended december  future share repurchases are subject to limitations contained in the indenture relating to our senior unsecured notes 
as of january   we had approximately million available for share repurchases and other restricted payments that are subject to these limitations 
this amount will increase in future periods by of our cumulative consolidated net income as defined in the indenture  the net proceeds of stock option exercises  and certain other items  and decrease by the amount of future share repurchases and other restricted payments subject to these limitations 
for further information  see liquidity and capital resources and note  notes payable and long term debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  million shares of our common stock were issued upon exercise of stock options  resulting in proceeds of million average price per share of 
we had a loss from discontinued operations totaling million in and million in  net of income taxes 
certain amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and  have been adjusted to reclassify as discontinued operations the results of stores that were sold  that we have entered into an agreement to sell  or for which we otherwise deem a proposed sales transaction to be probable with no material changes expected 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations  based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application 
goodwill  other intangible assets  and long lived assets goodwill  other intangible assets  and long lived assets are significant components of our consolidated balance sheets 
our policies regarding the valuation of intangible assets affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur 
goodwill consists of the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired  using the purchase method of accounting 
acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of our intent to do so 
our principal identifiable intangible assets are rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers 
we generally expect our franchise agreements to survive for the foreseeable future  and  when the agreements do not have indefinite terms  anticipate routine renewals of the agreements without substantial cost 
we believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for the foreseeable future and have indefinite lives 
goodwill and franchise rights assets are tested for impairment annually at june or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill  franchise rights assets  or other intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the fair value of the related underlying business 
the risk of goodwill and franchise rights impairment losses may increase to the extent that our market capitalization and earnings decline 
a sustained decrease in our market capitalization  or a negative long term performance outlook  could cause the carrying value of our reporting unit to exceed its fair value  which may result in an impairment loss 
impairment losses could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our debt agreements and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we estimate the depreciable lives of our property  plant  and equipment  including leasehold improvements  and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if  based on market conditions  the values of these assets should be adjusted 
although we believe our property  plant  and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued  the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets 
revenue recognition reserves for finance and insurance chargebacks revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles  commissions from related finance and insurance products  sales of parts and services  and sales of other products 
we recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided 
we recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed  the vehicle has been delivered  and payment has been received or financing has been arranged 
rebates  holdbacks  floorplan assistance  and certain other dealer credits received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program  whichever is later 
revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for i loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and ii vehicle protection products sold 
we primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis  however we also participate in future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  which are recognized as earned 
we may be charged back for unearned financing  insurance  or vehicle protection product commissions in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers chargebacks 
revenues from these fees are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles net of an estimated liability for chargebacks 
our estimate of chargebacks is based primarily on our historical chargeback experience  and is influenced by increases or decreases in early termination rates resulting from cancellation of vehicle protection products  defaults  refinancings and payoffs before maturity  and other factors 
income taxes accounting for our income taxes requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations 
we adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the completion of a tax audit  expiration of a statute of limitations  the refinement of an estimate  and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities  the valuation of our uncertain tax positions  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
other additionally  significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements including allowances for doubtful accounts  accruals related to self insurance programs  certain legal proceedings  estimated losses from disposals of discontinued operations  and certain assumptions related to determining stock option compensation

while we expect to continue repurchasing shares in the future  the decision to make additional share repurchases will be based on such factors as the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value  the potential impact on our capital structure  and the expected return on competing uses of capital such as dealership acquisitions  capital investments in our current businesses  or repurchases of our debt

seasonality our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  demand for vehicles and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the united states where stores may be subject to adverse winter conditions 
accordingly  we expect our revenue and operating results generally to be lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters 
however  revenue may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by actual or threatened severe weather events and by other factors unrelated to weather conditions  such as changing economic conditions and automotive manufacturer incentive programs
