item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that include numerous risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties  including those set forth in this annual report on form k under special note regarding forward looking statements and under risk factors 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of international coal group  inc and its subsidiaries appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents overview we produce  process and sell steam coal from regional mining complexes  which  as of december  were supported by active underground mines  active surface mines and nine preparation plants located throughout west virginia  kentucky  maryland and illinois 
we have three reportable business segments  which are based on the coal regions in which we operate i central appalachian  comprised of both surface and underground mines  ii northern appalachian  also comprised of both surface and underground mines and iii illinois basin  representing one underground mine 
for more information about our reportable business segments  please see our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
we also broker coal produced by others  the majority of which is shipped directly from the third party producer to the ultimate customer 
our steam coal sales are primarily to large utilities and industrial customers in the eastern region of the united states 
in addition  we generate other revenues from the manufacture and operation of highwall mining systems  parts sales and shop services relating to those systems and coal handling and processing fees 
icg  inc was formed by wl ross co 
llc wlr and other investors in may to acquire and operate competitive coal mining facilities 
international coal group  inc was formed in march and became the parent holding company pursuant to a reorganization on november  through the acquisition of key assets from the horizon bankruptcy estate  the wlr investor group was able to target properties strategically located in appalachia and the illinois basin with high quality reserves that are union free  have limited reclamation liabilities and are substantially free of legacy liabilities 
with the proceeds of our december public offering  we retired substantially all of our then outstanding debt 
consistent with the wlr investor group s strategy to acquire attractive coal assets  the anker and coalquest acquisitions further diversified our reserves in november our primary expenses are wages and benefits  repair and maintenance expenditures  diesel fuel purchases  blasting supplies  coal transportation costs  cost of purchased coal  royalties  freight and handling costs and taxes incurred in selling our coal 
certain trends and economic factors affecting the coal industry our revenues depend on the price at which we are able to sell our coal 
the pricing environment for domestic steam coal during was relatively weak 
further decreases in coal prices due to  among other reasons  the supply of domestic and foreign coal  the demand for electricity and the price and availability of alternative fuels for electricity generation could adversely affect our revenues and our ability to generate cash flows 
in addition  our results of operations depend on the cost of coal production 
we are experiencing increased operating costs for fuel and explosives  steel products  tires  health care and labor 
we also expect to experience higher costs for surety bonds and letters of credit 
in addition  historically low interest rates have had a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined employee related liabilities 
for additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  see item a 
risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates used 
note to our audited consolidated financial statements provides a description of all significant accounting policies 
we believe that of these significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
table of contents revenue recognition coal revenues result from sales contracts long term coal agreements or purchase orders with electric utilities  industrial companies or other coal related organizations  primarily in the eastern united states 
revenue is recognized and recorded at the time of shipment or delivery to the customer  at fixed or determinable prices and the title or risk of loss has passed in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement 
under the typical terms of these agreements  risk of loss transfers to the customers at the mine or port  where coal is loaded to the rail  barge  truck or other transportation sources that deliver coal to its destination 
freight and handling costs paid to third party carriers and invoiced to coal customers are recorded as freight and handling costs and freight and handling revenues  respectively 
other revenues consist of equipment and parts sales  equipment rebuild and maintenance services  coal handling and processing  royalties  ash disposal services  coalbed methane sales  coal contract buydown income  contract mining and rental income 
with respect to other revenues recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal  we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
advance payments received are deferred and recognized in revenue as coal is shipped or rental income is earned 
reclamation our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes  which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
we record these reclamation obligations according to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which the legal obligation associated with the retirement of the long lived asset is incurred 
fair value of reclamation liabilities is determined based on the present value of the estimated future expenditures 
when the liability is initially recorded  the offset is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
to settle the liability  the obligation is paid  and to the extent there is a difference between the liability and the amount of cash paid  a gain or loss upon settlement is recorded 
on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions to reflect current experience 
at december   we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of million  including amounts reported as current liabilities 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  as of december   we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closure is approximately million 

table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization property  plant  equipment and mine development  which includes coal lands  are recorded at cost  which includes construction overhead and interest  where applicable 
expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
coal land costs are depleted using the units of production method  based on estimated recoverable interest 
the coal lands fair values are established by either using engineering studies or market values as established when coal lands are purchased on the open market 
these values are then evaluated as to the number of recoverable tons contained in a particular mining area 
once the coal land values are established  and the number of recoverable tons contained in a particular coal land area is determined  a units of production depletion rate can be calculated 
this rate is then utilized to calculate depletion expense for each period mining is conducted on a particular coal lands area 
any uncertainty surrounding the application of the depletion policy is directly related to the assumptions as to the number of recoverable tons contained in a particular coal land area 
the amount of compensation paid for the coal lands is a set amount  however  the recoverable tons contained in the coal land area are based on engineering estimates which can  and often do  change as the tons are mined 
any change in the number of recoverable tons contained in a coal land area will result in a change in the depletion rate and corresponding depletion expense 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of depletion expense 
mine development costs are amortized using the units of production method  based on estimated recoverable tons in the same manner described above 
other property  plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives 
asset impairments we follow sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires that projected future cash flows from use and disposition of assets be compared with the carrying amounts of those assets 
when the sum of projected cash flows is less than the carrying amount  impairment losses are recognized 
in determining such impairment losses  discounted cash flows or asset appraisals are utilized to determine the fair value of the assets being evaluated 
also  in certain situations  expected mine lives are shortened because of changes to planned operations 
when that occurs and it is determined that the mine s underlying costs are not recoverable in the future  reclamation and mine closing obligations are accelerated and the mine closing accrual is increased accordingly 
to the extent it is determined asset carrying values will not be recoverable during a shorter mine life  a provision for such impairment is recognized 
recognition of an impairment will decrease asset values  increase operating expenses and decrease net income 
postretirement medical benefits some of our subsidiaries have long and short term liabilities for postretirement benefit cost obligations 
detailed information related to these liabilities is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
liabilities for postretirement benefits are not funded 
the liability is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and future cost trends  to estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits 
the discount rate assumption reflects the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments 
the discount rate used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for postretirement medical benefits was for the year ended december  we make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injury and illness obligations 
the future health care cost trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are expected to increase over the life of the plan 
the health care cost trend rate assumptions are determined primarily based upon our historical rate of change in retiree health care costs 
the postretirement expense in the operating period ended december  was based on an assumed heath care inflationary rate of in the operating period decreasing to in  which represents the ultimate health care cost trend rate for the remainder of the plan life 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed ultimate health care cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost components of the postretirement benefit expense for the year ended december  by million and increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed ultimate health care cost trend rate would decrease the service and interest cost components of the postretirement benefit expense for the year ended december  by million and decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by million 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates 
additionally  regulatory changes could increase our requirement to satisfy these or additional obligations 

table of contents workers compensation workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain personal injuries due to job related accidents are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs and  on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation  and by which the survivors of workers who suffer fatal injuries receive compensation for lost financial support 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee who is injured in the course of employment or the beneficiary of an employee that suffers fatal injuries in the course of employment 
our operations are covered through a combination of participation in a state run program and insurance policies 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarially determined amounts 
coal workers pneumoconiosis we are responsible under various federal statutes  and various states statutes  for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible employees resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
our operations are covered through a combination of participation in a state run program and insurance policies 
we accrue for any self insured liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarially determined amounts 
at december   we have recorded an accrual of million for black lung benefits 
individual losses in excess of million at the state level and million at the federal level are covered by our large deductible stop loss insurance 
actual losses may differ from these estimates  which could increase or decrease our costs 
coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal act provides for the funding of health benefits for certain union retirees and their spouses or dependants 
the coal act established the combined fund into which employers who are signatory operators and related persons are obligated to pay annual premiums for beneficiaries 
the coal act also created a second benefit fund for miners who retired between july  and september  and whose former employers are no longer in business 
upon the consummation of the business combination with anker  we assumed anker s coal act liabilities  which were estimated to be million at december  prior to the business combination with anker  we did not have any liability under the coal act 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if future taxable income is lower than expected or if expected tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated  we may record a change to the valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the determination is made 
goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   we had million in goodwill  which represents the excess of costs over fair value of certain assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from horizon on september  we assigned the goodwill to certain of the acquired reporting units based on their estimated fair values 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead must be tested for impairment at least annually  and more frequently if a triggering event occurs 
we perform our impairment test as of october st each year 
the goodwill impairment test consists of two steps 
the first identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using present value techniques  such as discounted cash flows of projected future operations developed by management or a weighting of income and market approaches 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not necessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step is necessary to measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
implied fair value of goodwill is determined as the amount that the fair value of the assets of a business unit exceeds their carrying value  excluding goodwill 
impairment loss is measured as the amount of the carrying value of goodwill that exceeds its implied fair value 
we measured impairment at october  and recorded a loss of million 

table of contents results of operations twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  revenues the following table depicts revenues for the years ended december  and for the indicated categories year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages and per ton data coal sales revenues freight and handling revenues other revenues total revenues tons sold coal revenue per ton coal sales revenues 
coal sales revenues are derived from sales of produced coal and brokered coal contracts 
coal sales revenues decreased million for the year ended december   or  compared to this decrease was due to a decrease in tons sold in compared to that resulted from a decrease of approximately million tons sold related to the idling  closure or cutback of production at mines in as discussed below and the expiration of certain brokered coal contracts  as well as geologic issues at several other mines 
the decrease in coal sales revenue from decreased sales tons was further impacted by a per ton reduction in sales realization of our coal primarily sold pursuant to coal supply agreements 
these decreases were partially offset by a million ton increase in tons sold from new mines that commenced full production in and from mines that experienced a full year of production in freight and handling revenues 
freight and handling revenues represent dollar for dollar reimbursement for shipments from certain of our operations for which we initially pay the freight and handling costs and are then reimbursed by the customer 
freight and handling revenues and costs increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to due to an increase in shipments from locations operating under such agreements  as well as increased transportation rates and fuel surcharges 
other revenues 
other revenues increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was due to million of revenue generated from coalbed methane wells owned jointly by our subsidiary  coalquest  and cdx  as well as increased revenue of million from our highwall mining activities and shop services and million from the sale of a narrow bench highwall mining system by addcar 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in plant processing revenue of million 
additionally  we recognized a million gain in related to the termination of a contractual coal delivery obligation 
no comparable gain was recognized in

coal sales revenues from our central appalachian segment decreased approximately million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of per ton in the average sales price of our coal primarily sold pursuant to coal supply agreements 
the decrease in sales realization was partially offset by an increase in tons sold of approximately million  or  over due to various mines  principally at our eastern and raven locations  significantly increasing or reaching full production in for the year ended december   our northern appalachian coal sales revenues increased approximately million  or  as compared to due to an increase in sales realization of per ton as segment operations benefited from favorable pricing from its coal supply agreements  as well as an increase in sales of metallurgical coal at prevailing market prices 
tons sold from our northern appalachian operations remained constant as compared to the prior year 
coal sales revenues from our illinois basin segment increased approximately million  or  as compared to due to an increase in coal sales revenue of per ton resulting from more favorable terms on its coal supply agreements 
our ancillary segment s coal sales revenues are comprised of coal sold under brokered coal contracts 
we experienced a decrease of million  or  due to a decrease of million tons primarily resulting from the expiration of brokered coal contracts

cost of coal sales 
for the year ended december   our total cost of coal sales decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of coal sales was primarily the result of a decrease in tons sold as described above which was partially offset by increase in cost per ton 
mining operations that significantly increased or reached full production in at our east mac and nellie  flint ridge deep  raven  mt 
sterling  guston run  crown surface  imperial  sentinel  county line and middle fork mines increased cost of coal sales by million 
increased costs from new mining operations were partially offset by a decrease in costs of million resulting from the closure or cutback of production at our higher cost flint ridge surface  rowdy gap  flint ridge highwall  blackberry creek  new hill  sago  crown east ii  sycamore no 
 island  tip top and elk hollow mines 
cost of coal sales at existing mines  as well as from brokered coal contracts  decreased million  primarily as a result of a million ton decrease in coal sales 
cost of coal sales per ton increased to for the year ended december  compared to in  an increase of 
the increase was mainly due to a per ton increase in the average cost of produced coal sold 
the increase in cost per ton of produced coal was caused by increases of per ton in labor and benefit costs  per ton in contract labor  per ton insurance and worker s compensation costs  per ton in fuel  oil and lubricants  per ton in blending material  per ton in insurance  and per ton in roof control supplies 
the increases were partially offset by decreases of per ton in equipment and vehicle lease costs 
purchased coal increased per ton  resulting in an increase of per ton in the average cost of coal sold 
cost of other revenues 
for the year ended december   cost of other revenues increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  of the increase  approximately million was due to costs related to addcar s sales of mining equipment during the year and exploration and development of coalbed methane resulted in an additional increase of million 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the principal component of the increase was an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended december  related to increased property and equipment purchased to improve efficiency at existing operations and to equip new mine developments 
additional increases in depreciation and amortization expense were due to coalbed methane well development costs of million 
the increases were partially offset by an increase in amortization income on below market coal supply agreements of million during the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily attributable to gifts aggregating million made in to the families of the thirteen miners involved in the sago mine accident  partially offset by an increase of million in professional and legal fees 
net gain on sale of assets 
net gain on sale of assets increased million for the year ended december  from  primarily due to a gain of approximately million related to the sale of our denmark property in the third quarter of goodwill impairment loss 
the goodwill impairment loss reflects the negative impact of several contributing factors which resulted in a reduction in the forecasted cash flows used to estimate fair value 
these factors include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the sales price of coal through our annual measurement date  increases in the cost of diesel fuel  explosives  tires  roofbolts and other materials used in mining coal  increased labor costs due to tightening labor markets  significant investments in the areas of safety and compliance and increased interest rates contributing to a higher discount rate 
furthermore  the business  regulatory and marketplace environments in which we currently operate differs significantly from the historical environments that drove the business cases used to value and record the acquisition of these business units 
accordingly  we have been unable to attain the forecasted projections that were used to initially value the business units at the date of acquisition 
the goodwill impairment losses were at the following business units million at hazard  million at eastern  million at east kentucky and million at knott county 

table of contents adjusted ebitda by segment adjusted ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  impairment charges and minority interest 
adjusted ebitda is presented because it is an important supplemental measure of our performance used by our chief operating decision maker in such areas as capital investment and allocation of resources 
it is considered adjusted as we adjust ebitda for impairment charges and minority interest 
adjusted ebitda is calculated differently than the prior year in that it includes an adjustment for impairment charges 
no impairment charges were incurred in the prior year 
other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
adjusted ebitda is reconciled to its most comparable gaap measure on page of this annual report on form k and in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the following table depicts segment adjusted ebitda for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages central appalachian northern appalachian illinois basin ancillary total adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda from our central appalachian segment decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the decreased realization per ton as discussed above 
also impacting the decrease were inflated operating costs per ton primarily resulting from regulatory issues and short term mine constraints 
the reduced realizations and increased costs resulted in a decrease in profit margins of per ton 
additionally  activities incidental to our coal producing activities decreased by million in further contributing to the decrease in adjusted ebitda 
the increase in adjusted ebitda from our northern appalachian segment of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in coal sales revenue as of per ton and decreased costs of per ton resulting in increased profit margins of per ton 
adjusted ebitda from our illinois basin segment increased million during the year ended december  due to a per ton increase in sales realization over with cost per ton remaining constant with prior year 
the increase in adjusted ebitda from our ancillary segment of million was primarily due to the sale of the denmark property in september  which resulted in a gain of million  as well as from increased contributions to income from our investment in coalbed methane wells and from our addcar subsidiary as discussed above 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in adjusted ebitda resulting from the expiration of brokered coal contracts

cost of coal sales and other revenues 
for the year ended december   our cost of coal sales increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of coal sales was primarily a result of our acquisitions of anker and coalquest  which resulted in an increase in cost of coal sales of approximately million  and includes several unusual events and operating difficulties adversely affecting the year  such as the closure of the stony river deep mine  the bankruptcy of a key coal supplier for our vindex operation  an extended construction outage at the sentinel mine  adverse geological conditions encountered at the sycamore no 
mine and the effects of the sago mine accident in january our performance was also adversely affected in the second quarter of by a fire at our illinois mining complex 
the start up of our flint ridge  east mac and nellie  raven  crown  carlos and imperial mine sites  as well as the purchase of our jackson mountain mine site  increased cost of coal sales by million 
other factors affecting cost of coal sales and other revenues for the year were increases in prices for diesel fuel and lube costs of million  increased blasting supplies costs of million  increased contract labor costs of million and increased tire costs of million 
variable sales related costs  such as royalties and severance taxes increased million due to increased sales realization 
trucking costs increased million due to escalated diesel fuel costs 
in addition  salary and hourly payroll expense and related employee benefits increased million due to increased personnel and the necessity to maintain a competitive compensation program due to a highly competitive labor market 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in stockpile inventories which decreased cost of coal sales for the period by million  decreases in equipment rental expense of million due to the decision to purchase rather than lease needed equipment  decreased insurance costs of million primarily caused by the change from a state run workers compensation program to a private insurance carrier and a decrease in purchase coal costs of million 
costs of coal sales for the year includes million relating to the sago mine accident  including reserves established for claims and other future costs and million of carrying costs related to the mining operation prior to resuming operations at the end of the first quarter 

table of contents freight and handling costs 
freight and handling costs increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase is due to an increase in shipments for which we initially pay the freight and handling costs and are then reimbursed by the customer 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  depreciation  depletion and amortization per ton increased to per ton sold in the year ended december  from per ton sold for the year ended december  the principal component of the increase was an increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of million for the year ended december   million of which was related to the acquisitions of anker and coalquest  as well as an increase in capital expenditures and coalbed methane well costs 
the increases were offset by a net increase in amortization income on above and below market coal supply agreements of million during the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the net increase of million was attributable to gifts aggregating million made to the families of the thirteen miners involved in the sago mine accident  increases in legal  professional and consulting fees of million  million for share based compensation related restricted stock and stock options  million in compensation expense and million in insurance expense 
increases in legal  professional and consulting fees  as well as compensation and insurance expense  were related to being a public company 
these increases were offset by a million reduction in payroll taxes related to stock based compensation 
in  certain recipients of restricted stock awards filed section b elections  which resulted in full taxation of the award at the grant date rather than upon vesting 
gain on sale of assets 
asset sales resulted in a gain of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  total costs as a percentage of revenues 
total costs as a percentage of revenues increased to approximately for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily as a result of weak coal prices in the second half of  unanticipated operating difficulties at certain mine locations  mine accidents at two locations and increased operating costs 
the softening of the coal market in the second half of caused a decrease in our profit margin earned on spot coal sales 
unanticipated adverse operating conditions experienced at the stony river deep mine  sentinel mine and sycamore no 
resulted in increased operating expenses with a reduced amount or no corresponding production for the year 
due to the sago mine accident as well as the mine fire at our illinois mining complex we experienced production interruptions that decreased sales while still incurring holding costs as the mines were being repaired 
profit margins were further squeezed at all locations compared to the prior year by increased employee compensation as well as increased prices of operating parts  supplies and services as discussed above 

table of contents adjusted ebitda by segment adjusted ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization and minority interest 
adjusted ebitda is presented because it is an important supplemental measure of our performance used by our chief operating decision maker 
it is considered adjusted as we adjust ebitda for minority interest 
other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
adjusted ebitda is reconciled to its most comparable gaap measure on page of this annual report on form k and in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the following table depicts segment adjusted ebitda for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages central appalachian northern appalachian illinois basin ancillary total adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda from our central appalachian segment increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to an increase in tons sold by our central appalachian operations 
the increase in sales tons was partially offset by less favorable profit margins of approximately per ton resulting from increased production costs 
additionally  activities incidental to our coal producing activities  such as coal processing and royalty income  increased by million and million  respectively  in  contributing to the increase in adjusted ebitda 
the decrease in adjusted ebitda from our northern appalachian segment of million was primarily the result of a full year of operations in by the mining complexes acquired from anker and coalquest in november additionally  several unusual events and operating difficulties  such as the closure of the stony river deep mine  the bankruptcy of a key coal supplier for our vindex operation  an extended construction outage at the sentinel mine and adverse geological conditions encountered at the sycamore no 
mine  adversely affected adjusted ebitda 
also impacting the decrease were the effects of the sago mine accident in january  which decreased adjusted ebitda by million as a result of reserves established for claims and other future costs and million of mine holding costs prior to resuming operations at the end of the first quarter 
adjusted ebitda from our illinois basin segment decreased million  or  due to a fire at our viper mine which led to a temporary idling of the mine in the decrease in adjusted ebitda from our ancillary segment of million was the result of decreased margins on contract mining activities performed by our subsidiary addcar resulting from varying mining conditions at the contracting parties mining complexes and increased direct costs 
also impacting the decrease were increased selling  general and administrative expenses due to gifts aggregating million made to the families of the thirteen miners involved in the sago mine accident  expenses related to being a public company  including legal  professional and consulting fees of million  share based compensation of million and compensation expense of million 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in payroll taxes paid in related to stock based compensation

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires substantial capital expenditures for  among other things  purchasing  upgrading and maintaining equipment used in developing and mining our coal lands  as well as remaining in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
our principal liquidity requirements are to finance our coal production  fund capital expenditures and service our debt and reclamation obligations 
we may also engage in acquisitions and or divestitures from time to time 
our primary sources of liquidity to meet our needs are cash flows from sales of our coal  other income  borrowings under our senior credit facility  the proceeds of our convertible notes offering and capital equipment financing arrangements 
as of december   our total cash and cash equivalents was million and we had million available for borrowing under our million senior credit facility 
however  weak performance in the first half of the year led management to believe that we would not be able to meet the financial covenants in our senior credit facility at future required certification dates  thereby restricting access to the availability under our senior credit facility 
accordingly  management proactively sought additional sources of liquidity to provide financial flexibility and to avoid constraining our capital growth program for our beckley  sentinel and tygart valley projects 
on july   we and our subsidiaries entered into a million bridge loan facility with a certain fund affiliated with wl ross co 
llc wlr 
we and our subsidiaries were jointly and severally liable for the loan  which was repaid in full on july  with a portion of the proceeds of the convertible notes offering described below 
on july   we completed a private offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due pursuant to rule a under the securities act of we granted the initial purchaser a day over allotment option pursuant to which we issued an additional million of convertible notes on august  the convertible notes are our senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by our material future and current domestic subsidiaries 
the convertible notes and the related guarantees rank equal in right of payment to all of our and the guarantors respective existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 
interest is payable semi annually on february and august  commencing on february  we received aggregate proceeds of million  after deducting the initial purchaser s discounts and commissions of million 
we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay in full the million bridge loan due to wlr and the million outstanding under our amended credit facility 
the remaining million will be used to fund capital expenditures  for general corporate purposes and other expenses related to the offering of million 
the principal amount of the convertible notes is payable in cash and amounts above the principal amount  if any  will be convertible into shares of our common stock or  at our option  cash 
the convertible notes are convertible i prior to february  during any calendar quarter after september   if the closing sale price per share of our common stock for each of or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter  ii prior to february  during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which the average trading price for the notes on each day during such five trading day period was equal to or less than of the closing sale price of our common stock on such day multiplied by the then current conversion rate  iii upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  and iv at any time from  and including february  until the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding august  we entered into a registration rights agreement with initial purchaser of the convertible notes that required us to file a shelf registration statement to register the resale of convertible notes with the securities and exchange commission by october  as a result of the restatement of our financial statements for the year ending december   and the period may  inception to december   we were delayed in filing the registration statement until november  as a result  we were required to pay additional interest at a per annum rate of  or  until the shelf registration statement was filed 
this additional interest did not materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
concurrent with the closing of the offering  we amended certain covenants under our senior credit facility to allow for additional flexibility under our financial covenants which include a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum capital expenditures and to allow for the offering 
the amendment to our senior credit facility also reduced our total senior credit facility commitments by the same amount of the gross proceeds from the offering to million 
on september   we completed the sale of our denmark reserve in southern illinois for million in cash and an overriding royalty totaling million on certain future production 
the sale resulted in a gain of million and provided additional cash to execute our capital expenditure program 
the results of the annual impairment tests of goodwill conducted as of october  of the icg hazard  icg eastern  icg east kentucky and icg knott county business units indicated that their estimated fair values were less than the carrying amounts of the respective business unit assets  including goodwill  and  therefore  were impaired 
as a result  we recorded a million million net of tax non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value 
the impairment loss did not impact us under any of our borrowing arrangements 

table of contents cash paid for capital expenditures was approximately million for the year ended december  and we currently expect out total capital expenditures will be approximately million and million in and  respectively 
we have funded these capital expenditures from our internal operations  proceeds from our senior and convertible notes offerings in and  respectively  borrowing under our credit facility and our million equipment revolving credit facility with caterpillar financial services corporation 
we believe that these sources of capital  as well as the proceeds from the offering and from the sale of our denmark reserve  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated capital expenditures under our current budget plan through we currently anticipate needing to obtain additional financing in approximately the second quarter of the timing of seeking additional capital will be subject to market conditions and  to the extent necessary  management can control the timing of the need by managing the pace of capital spending 
approximately million of cash paid for capital expenditures were attributable to central appalachian operations 
this amount represent investments of approximately million in our beckley mining complex  as well as additional investments of million in our newly developed east mac and nellie  flint ridge no 
 raven and mt 
sterling mine sites 
additionally  we expended approximately million for upgrades and maintenance at our hazard  knott county  east kentucky and eastern operations 
we spent approximately million for development and improvements of our northern appalachian operations in the year ended december  approximately million of the amount was investments in our sentinel and tygart mine site and approximately million was expended for our operations at jackson mountain  imperial and guston run mine sites 
additionally  we invested approximately million for current operations at vindex  buckhannon  patriot and harrison mine sites 
expenditures of approximately million for our illinois basin operations were for ongoing operations improvements 
approximately million of cash paid for capital expenditures for the year ended december  were within our ancillary segment 
approximately million was for our investment in a joint operating agreement for the purpose of exploration and development of coalbed methane 
the remaining million is attributable to upgrades maintenance at various other subsidiaries 
as a result of recent accidents in the mining industry  new legislation has been announced that will require additional capital expenditures to meet enhanced safety standards 
for the year ended december   we spent million to meet these standards and anticipate spending an additional million in cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from this decrease is attributable to an increase in net operating assets and liabilities of million offset by a decrease in net loss of million after adjustment for non cash charges 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million compared to million for the year ended december  for  million of cash was used to support existing mining operations and for development of new mining complexes compared to million in investing activities for also included cash paid of million representing contingency payments related to the horizon acquisition as compared to million in additionally  we collected proceeds from asset sales of million during the year ended december  versus million during net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to proceeds of million from our convertible senior notes offering 
additionally  we had borrowings of million on our credit facility and an additional million was provided by short term notes entered into during the year 
these borrowings were offset by repayments on our short term and long term debt and capital leases of million and million  respectively 
also impacting financing activities for the year ended december  was additional finance costs of million related to the issuance of our convertible notes and amending our credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from this decrease is attributable to a decrease in earnings of million  after adjustment for non cash charges 
the remaining decrease was due to the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of million 
net income decreased in compared to primarily as a result of higher operating costs  most notably diesel fuel  trucking costs due to increased diesel costs  blasting supplies  roof bolts and plates  the effects of the sago mine accident  the effects of the viper mine fire  labor costs due to the highly competitive labor market and other operating issues noted above 
also impacting the comparability of net income for compared with was the acquisition of anker and coalquest in november for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities for was million to replace our aged mining equipment fleet and expand operations compared to million in cash was returned from deposits of collateral for reclamation and royalty bonds of million in compared to million in positively affecting investing activities for were proceeds of asset sales of million and proceeds received in connection with a sale leaseback transaction of million 
investing activities also include cash paid of million for bonding payments and other items relating to the acquisitions of anker and coalquest and the former horizon companies 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to proceeds of million related to our senior note offering  which closed on june  the proceeds were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the then existing revolving credit facility of million  including million of which was borrowed in the first six months of  and retire the then outstanding term loan facility of million 
simultaneous with the senior notes offering  our credit facility was amended and restated resulting in an increased credit facility of up to million

credit facility 
in june  we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the amended credit facility consisting of a revolving credit facility which matures on june  in july  concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes  we further amended the amended credit facility to reduce the commitments thereunder to million  of which a maximum of million may be used for letters of credit 
the amendment  among other things  modified the maximum permitted leverage ratio  the minimum interest coverage ratio and the maximum amount of capital expenditures permitted 
further  the amendment also revised certain interest rate thresholds and unused commitment fee levels under the amended credit facility

table of contents other as a regular part of our business  we review opportunities for  and engage in discussions and negotiations concerning  the acquisition of coal mining assets and interests in coal mining companies  and acquisitions of  or combinations with  coal mining companies 
when we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our growth plans and our acquisition criteria  we will make bids or proposals and or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements  which may be binding or nonbinding  that are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the discussions and any related agreement if  among other things  we are not satisfied with the results of our due diligence investigation 
any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness  seek equity capital or both 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
additionally  we have other long term liabilities  including  but not limited to  mine reclamation and mine closure costs  below market coal supply agreements and black lung costs  and some of our subsidiaries have long term liabilities relating to retiree health and other employee benefits 
our ability to meet our long term debt obligations will depend upon our future performance  which in turn  will depend upon general economic  financial and business conditions  along with competition  legislation and regulation factors that are largely beyond our control 
based upon our current operations  we believe that cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including additional borrowings under our credit facility  will be adequate for at least the next months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and for funding anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include guarantees and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
no liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
federal and state laws require us to secure payment of certain long term obligations  such as mine closure and reclamation costs  federal and state workers compensation  coal leases and other obligations 
we typically secure these payment obligations by using surety bonds  an off balance sheet instrument 
the use of surety bonds is less expensive than posting an all cash bond or a bank letter of credit  either of which would require a greater use of our credit facility 
we then use bank letters of credit to secure our surety bonding obligations as a lower cost alternative than securing those bonds with cash 
we currently have a million committed bonding facility pursuant to which we are required to provide bank letters of credit in an amount up to of the aggregate bond liability 
recently  surety bond costs have increased  while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable 
to the extent that surety bonds become unavailable  we would seek to secure our reclamation obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral 
as of december   we had outstanding surety bonds with third parties for post mining reclamation totaling million  plus million for miscellaneous purposes 
as of december    we maintained letters of credit totaling million to secure reclamation surety bonds and other obligations
