item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein 
overview we are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have two operating segments i triumph aerospace systems group  whose companies design  engineer  manufacture and sell a wide range of proprietary and build to print components  assemblies and systems for the global aerospace oem market  and ii triumph aftermarket services group  whose companies serve aircraft fleets  notably commercial airlines  the us military and cargo carriers  through the maintenance  repair and overhaul of aircraft components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
financial highlights for the fiscal year ended march  include net sales for fiscal increased to billion operating income in fiscal increased to million net income for fiscal increased to million backlog increased over prior year to billion for the fiscal year ended march   net sales totaled billion  a increase from fiscal year net sales of billion 
net income for fiscal year increased to million  or per diluted common share  versus million  or per diluted common share  for fiscal year our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
for the fiscal year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flows from operating activities  used approximately million in investing activities and generated approximately million in financing activities 
we continue to remain focused on growing our core businesses as well as growing through strategic acquisitions 
our organic growth remained strong in fiscal through the addition of products and services  the expansion of our operating capacity and marketing our complete portfolio of capabilities  while benefiting from the continued strength in the aerospace markets generally 
our core revenue growth in fiscal as compared to fiscal excluding the impact of acquisitions was 
our company has an aggressive but selective acquisition approach that adds capabilities and increases our capacity for strong and consistent internal growth 
in february  the company acquired the assets and business of b 
r 
machine tool corp 
b r through a newly organized  wholly owned subsidiary of the company  triumph structures long island  llc 
triumph structures long island  llc provides aircraft structural components and dynamic parts and assemblies for commercial and military aerospace programs 
the results for triumph structures long island  llc are included in the company s aerospace systems segment 
outlook based upon the assumptions about our market set forth below  and subject to the risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we expect net sales for the fiscal year ending march  to be in the range of billion to billion  and earnings per share for fiscal to be between and 
the fiscal outlook assumes  among other factors  a full year effective tax rate of  which reflects the fact that the research and development tax credit expired on december  the outlook for earnings per share is based on a fully diluted share count of million shares 
our fiscal outlook is based on the following market assumptions we expect the commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry to remain extremely competitive 
market liberalization in europe and asia has continued to enable low cost airlines to gain market share  and traditional airlines continue to improve their competitive position by lowering their cost structure through merger  bankruptcy and restructuring 
some of the airline restructurings have led to increased outsourcing opportunities  benefiting our aftermarket services segment 
the financial health of the commercial airline industry has a direct effect on our commercial aircraft programs 
while near term challenges include high fuel prices and continuing turmoil in global credit markets  airlines are responding by focusing on controlling non fuel related expenses and implementing operational efficiencies 
based upon currently available market forecasts  we expect aircraft seat miles  a key indicator of airline health  to remain steady at to annual growth in calendar and continue at these levels through calendar  positively affecting our business 
the airlines ability to implement fare increases to partially offset the high cost of fuel should also help to stabilize the financial position of the airlines 
air cargo continues to exhibit strong growth and financial stability  a key market segment for triumph given our product penetration with these carriers 
we expect the continued growth in air freight will benefit us and the industry 
deliveries of boeing and airbus large commercial aircraft are expected to be higher in calendar compared to calendar boeing and airbus reported actual deliveries for calendar of aircraft 
their deliveries for calendar are expected to increase by approximately  to about aircraft 
we expect our direct and indirect sales to boeing and airbus will benefit from such increases 
total regional and business aircraft production is expected to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal  as deliveries of business jets are expected to significantly increase with the production of various models of very light jets 
in the regional aircraft market we expect to see growth driven by the seat jet and seat turboprop segments  slightly offset by continued weakness in the seat jet products 
the major trends that shape the current military defense environment include a growing us government defense budget and rapid expansion of information and communication technologies 
although under pressure  the us defense budget remains strong and focused on transformation 
with this continued pressure on the budget  we believe the us department of defense will continue to focus on affordability strategies emphasizing network centric operations  joint interoperability  long range strike capability  unmanned air combat and reconnaissance vehicles  precision guided weapons and continued privatization of logistics and support activities as a means to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs 
military sales oem and aftermarket are expected to increase roughly in line with global military budgets  which are expected to grow in the single digit range for calendar compared to calendar results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  year ended march  in thousands net sales   segment operating income   corporate general and administrative expenses   total operating income   interest expense and other   charge for early extinguishment of debt  income tax expense   income from continuing operations   loss from discontinued operations  net   net income   net sales increased by million  or  to billion for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  the acquisitions of the assets and businesses of allied aerospace industries  inc now triumph aerospace systems newport news and grand prairie accessory services  llc now triumph accessory services grand prairie  which were completed during the fiscal year ended march   and the acquisition of the assets and business of b

corporate expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to increased litigation costs  workers compensation and stock compensation costs  partially offset by an insurance reimbursement related to product liability claims 
interest expense and other increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to million for the prior year period 
this increase was due to higher average borrowings outstanding and amortization of debt issuance costs  partially offset by lower interest on our convertible notes issued in september as compared to the previously outstanding class a senior notes and class b senior notes collectively  the senior notes

the notes are direct  unsecured  senior subordinated obligations of the company  and rank i junior in right of payment to all of the company s existing and future senior indebtedness  ii equal in right of payment with any other future senior subordinated indebtedness  and iii senior in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness 
the company received net proceeds from the sale of the notes of approximately million after deducting offering expenses of approximately million 
the use of the net proceeds from the sale was for prepayment of the company s outstanding senior notes  including a make whole premium  fees and expenses in connection with the prepayment  and to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the company s credit facility 
approximately million in debt issuance costs have been recorded as other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
debt issuance costs are being amortized over a period of five years 
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  payable in cash semi annually in arrears on each april and october beginning april  during the period commencing on october  and ending on  but excluding  april  and each six month period from october to march or from april to september thereafter  the company will pay contingent interest during the applicable interest period if the average trading price of a note for the five consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the relevant six month period equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the notes 
the contingent interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal per annum calculated on the average trading price of a note for the relevant five trading day period 
this contingent interest feature represents an embedded derivative 
since it is in the control of the company to call the notes at any time after october   the value of the derivative was determined to be de minimis 
accordingly  no value has been assigned at issuance or at march  the notes mature on october  unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted 
the company may redeem the notes for cash  either in whole or in part  anytime on or after october  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any  up to but not including the date of redemption

the notes are eligible for conversion upon meeting certain conditions as provided in the indenture agreement 
for the periods from october  through december  and january  through march   the notes were eligible for conversion  however  during this period  none of the notes was converted 
to be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  the average price of the company s common stock for the fiscal year must exceed the conversion price per share of

the company is currently in compliance with all such covenants 
as of march   the company had borrowing capacity under the credit facility of million  after reductions for borrowings and letters of credit outstanding 
effective april  the company entered into a settlement agreement with a customer relating to a long term supply agreement ltsa 
the ltsa is related to the company s acquisition of rolls royce gear systems  inc  in fiscal the company has been producing the component parts for this ltsa at a loss for approximately two years which has been reserved for through a loss contract reserve 
the agreement provides for the parties to establish a transition plan that provides for the customer to re source the component parts from other suppliers  essentially terminating the company s requirement to provide future deliveries of these component parts 
the agreement establishes a date of no later than december  for completion of the re sourcing effort 
additionally  the company is required to make a total of four payments of million upon successful transition of the component parts by the customer to other vendors 
a payment of million was made in october the company recorded the estimated impact of this settlement in its march  balance sheet  which did not result in a significant adjustment to the recorded loss reserve 
as of march  and march   the recorded loss reserve was million and million  respectively 
if the transition is completed earlier than december   or the quantity  price or cost of units delivered by the company is different than anticipated under the settlement agreement  an adjustment to the recorded loss reserve may be required 
because we cannot determine the extent of re sourcing that may occur or the timing of the re sourcing  we monitor progress and make appropriate adjustments  as may be necessary  to the loss contract reserve on a periodic basis 
capital expenditures were approximately million for the fiscal year ended march  primarily for manufacturing machinery and equipment 
we funded these expenditures through borrowings under our credit facility 
we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of to million for our fiscal year ending march  the expenditures are expected to be used mainly to expand capacity or replace old equipment at several facilities 
our expected future cash flows for the next five years for long term debt  leases and other obligations are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands debt principal     debt interest     operating leases      purchase obligations     total      included in the company s balance sheet at march  includes fixed rate interest only 
the above table excludes unrecognized tax benefits of million as of march  since we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
the table also excludes our pension benefit obligations 
we made pension contributions of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these contributions include payments related to a supplemental executive retirement plan of million in fiscal  and payments to our union pension plans of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
we expect to make pension contributions of million to our pension plans during fiscal see note  employee benefit plans of our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and other employee benefit plans 
we believe that cash generated by operations and borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations 
however  we have a stated policy to grow through acquisitions and are continuously evaluating various acquisition opportunities 
as a result  we currently are pursuing the potential purchase of a number of candidates 
in the event that more than one of these transactions are successfully consummated  the availability under the credit facility might be fully utilized and additional funding sources may be needed 
there can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on terms favorable to us  if at all 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the appropriate allowance  we consider a combination of factors  such as industry trends  our customers financial strength and credit standing  and payment and default history 
the calculation of the required allowance requires a judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identification methods 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  inventory adjustments may be required 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in accordance with the contract terms when products are shipped  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the aftermarket services segment provides repair and overhaul services  certain of which services are provided under long term power by the hour contracts 
the company applies the proportional performance method to recognize revenue under these contracts 
revenue is recognized over the contract period as units are delivered based on the relative fair value in proportion to the total estimated contract consideration 
reserves for contract losses are accrued when estimated costs to complete exceed expected future revenues 
the company s policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances  except at the company s option 
accruals for sales returns  other allowances  and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience 
goodwill and intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
additionally  intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company s operating segments of aerospace systems and aftermarket services are also the reporting units under sfas no 
each operating segment has a president who is responsible for managing the segment and reporting to the president and ceo of the company  the company s chief operating decision maker codm  as defined in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
each of the operating segments is comprised of a number of operating units which are considered to be components under sfas no 
the operating units  for which discrete financial information exists  are aggregated for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
the company s acquisition strategy is to acquire companies that complement and enhance the capabilities of the operating segments of the company 
each acquisition is assigned to either the aerospace systems reporting unit or the aftermarket services reporting unit 
the goodwill that results from each acquisition is also assigned to the reporting unit to which the acquisition is allocated  because it is that reporting unit which is intended to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition 
sfas no 
requires a two step impairment test for goodwill 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then the second step is required to be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and record any resulting impairment losses at least annually 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates and require interim impairment assessments 
we completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that there was no impairment 
for our impairment test  we use market multiples from an external source for an average of stock price to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for certain companies in the aerospace and defense markets in computing the fair value of each reporting unit 
in the event that market multiples for stock price to ebitda in the aerospace and defense markets decrease  or the expected ebitda for our reporting units decreases  a goodwill impairment charge may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition
