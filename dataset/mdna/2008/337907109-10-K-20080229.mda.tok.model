item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the balance sheets and statements of income are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting for the allowances for loan losses involves significant judgments and assumptions by management which has a material impact on the carrying value of net loans receivable 
we consider the accounting for loan valuation allowances to be a critical accounting policy 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed reasonable under the circumstances as described in the business loan loss allowance section 
the majority of our residential loans are obtained from wholesale loan brokers 
loan origination costs for residential loans obtained from wholesale loan brokers will generally include fees paid to those brokers  resulting in loan origination costs exceeding loan fees received 
these excess loan origination costs are amortized as an adjustment of loan yield based on the expected lives of the related loans  including an estimate of the prepayment speeds on the portfolio 
risks and uncertainties in the normal course of business  we encounter two significant types of risk economic risk  regulatory risk and operational risk  all of which are discussed in item a 
risk factors 
economic risk there are three main components of economic risk credit risk  collateral risk  and market risk which includes interest rate risk 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of default in our loan portfolio that results from a borrower s inability to make contractually required payments 
our credit risk increased substantially during due to the number of adjustable rate mortgages that reached their maximum allowable negative amortization and now require an increased payment 
many borrowers who now can not afford the increased payments are finding that they can not refinance their mortgages due to the downturn in single family home values and that mortgage lenders have tightened their lending standards since the time they initially obtained their loans 
as a result  single family loan delinquencies increased substantially in all categories during see loss provision and non performing assets 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of real estate collateral are based on estimates that are susceptible to changes in the economic environment and market conditions 
we recorded loan loss provisions of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
a continued downturn in the current economic climate could increase the likelihood of additional losses due to credit risk which would create the need for additional loan loss provisions 
collateral risk collateral risk is the risk that the collateral securing our loans  primarily real estate  may decline in value 
both single family home values and home sales decreased substantially in the state of california during negative amortization  which is added to the outstanding loan balance  increases collateral risk 
a continued downturn in the california real estate market could increase the likelihood of additional charge offs and loan loss provisions if the loan exceeds the value of the collateral 
this could create the need for additional loan loss provisions 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises primarily from the interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
the federal reserve decreased interest rates four times during and twice so far during normally we see an immediate impact on the bank s cost of funds 
however  some depository institutions in the bank s market areas are experiencing liquidity problems and are paying higher than expected rates on deposits 
this may cause the cost of funds to remain artificially high and may cause our net interest spread to decrease 
should there be a more significant or long lasting economic or market downturn or if market interest rates increase significantly  we could experience a material increase in the level of loan defaults and charge offs 
a sustained flat or inverted interest rate yield curve may hamper our ability to originate adjustable rate loans and may cause additional loan prepayments 
see asset liability management in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information relating to market risk 
regulatory risk regulatory risk is the risk that regulations will change or the regulators will reach different conclusions than we have regarding our financial position 
the ots examines our financial results  capital adequacy  asset quality  and other performance measures every year 
the ots reviews the allowance for loan losses and may require us to adjust the allowance based on information available at the time of their examination 
the ots can also require that we maintain capital levels above the regulatory minimums 
other risks inflation inflation substantially impacts the financial position and operations of financial intermediaries  such as banks and savings institutions 
these entities primarily hold monetary assets and liabilities and  as such  can experience significant purchasing power gains and losses over relatively short periods of time 
in addition  interest rate changes during inflationary periods change the amounts and composition of assets and liabilities held by financial intermediaries and could result in regulatory pressure for increasing our capital 
pending lawsuits we have been named as a defendant in various lawsuits  none of which are expected to have a materially adverse effect on us 
overview our results of operations are primarily affected by our levels of net interest income  provisions for loan losses  non interest income  non interest expense  and income taxes 
our results are strongly influenced by the california economy in which we operate and the direction and level of general market interest rates 
net income of million  or per diluted share  was recorded in  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in and net income of million  or per diluted share  in net income decreased from to primarily due to decreases in net interest income  higher provisions for loan losses  higher occupancy costs and increased losses on real estate operations 
net income grew from to due to increased net interest income  higher loan prepayment fees and gains on the sale of loans 
consolidated assets at the end of were billion  representing a decrease from billion at the end of and a decrease from billion at the end of the declines in assets during and are attributable to a drop in loan origination activity and an increase in loan payoffs 
loan originations decreased to billion during  compared to billion in and billion in loan originations decreased in both and due to higher interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages  the weakened california real estate market  the impact resulting from implementing the interagency guidance on non traditional mortgage product risks  the subprime mortgage crisis that started in and the collapse of the secondary market for loans 
certain of our key financial ratios are presented below year ended december  return on average assets return on average equity average equity to average assets we recorded loan loss provisions of million  million and million during  and  respectively

during the month of august  the board of directors authorized the expansion of the company s stock repurchase program to permit repurchase of an additional  shares 
the shares eligible for repurchase totaled  shares as of february  we did not repurchase any of our stock in or components of income net interest income net interest income is the primary component of our income 
the chief determinants of net interest income are the dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid thereon 
the greater the excess of average interest earning assets over average interest bearing liabilities  the more beneficial the impact on net interest income 
the excess of average interest earning assets over average interest bearing liabilities was million in  million in and million in during  we adopted a change in financial reporting practice required by the ots to classify prepayment fees and late charges as interest income rather than non interest income 
the computations for previous years were revised to include these fees with interest income 
this change results in loan prepayment fees being classified in the same category as the amortization of deferred origination costs  which were always recorded in interest income 
loan prepayment fees decreased to million in  compared to million in and million in  because a fewer number of loans subject to prepayment fees were paid off by borrowers 
real estate loans subjected to prepayment fees represented   and of loans originated during  and  respectively 
to conform to industry practice  starting in  we began including federal home loan bank stock dividends in the computation of the yield on investments and interest earning assets 
the computations for previous years were correspondingly adjusted 
fhlb stock dividends were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the average yield on fhlb stock was  and in  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed our practice for recording dividend income on fhlb stock to recognize income when the final dividend amount is declared 
the accrual at the end of was reversed against retained earnings on january  in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab and no accrual was recorded at the end of or if we had continued to follow our previous practice for recording dividends on fhlb stock  interest on investments would have been thousand lower in and thousand lower in the following table sets forth the components of interest earning assets and liabilities  the excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities  the yields earned and rates paid and net interest income for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands average loans average investment securities   average interest earning assets   average deposits average borrowings average interes bearing liabilities   excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities yields earned on average interest earning assets rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread effective net spread interest on loans interest and dividends on investments total interest income interest on deposits interest on borrowings total interest expense net interest income non accrual loans are included in the average dollar amount of loans outstanding 
however  generally no income is included for the period that each such loan was on non accrual status 
the effective net spread is a fraction  the numerator of which is net interest income and the denominator of which is the average dollar amount of interest earning assets 
our net interest income is impacted by a time lag before changes in the cost of funds can be passed along to adjustable rate loan clients 
savings and borrowing costs adjust to market rates quickly  whereas it takes two to three months for loan yields to adjust 
this time lag decreases our net interest income during periods of rising interest rates 
the reverse is true during periods of declining interest rates 
see asset liability management in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion 
net interest income decreased by during compared to mainly due to a decrease in average interest earning assets 
despite the decrease in earning assets  the interest rate spread increased to in from in the yield on the loan portfolio continued to adjust upward during the first half of due to interest rate increases made by the federal reserve board in the loan yield started to decrease at the end of due to rate cuts made by the federal reserve board in the second half of the year 
however  the cost of funds  which responds more quickly to changes in interest rates  showed more of a decrease during the second half of the table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in our interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated

net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
loan loss provision we recorded loan loss provisions of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the increased provision was due to foreclosed and delinquent single family loans resulting from the downturn in the california real estate market and tighter lending standards imposed by mortgage lenders  which took away refinancing options 
single family non accrual loans greater than days delinquent or in foreclosure increased to million at december  from million as of december  single family loans delinquent less than days increased to million as of december  from million as of december  non performing assets were million at december   compared to million and million at december  and we have a policy of providing for general valuation allowances  unallocated to any specific loan  but available to offset any loan losses 
the allowance is maintained at an amount that we believe to be adequate to cover estimable and probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
we also maintain valuation allowances for impaired loans and loans sold with recourse when needed 
see business loan loss allowance 
we perform regular risk assessments of our loan portfolio to maintain appropriate valuation allowances 
additional loan loss provisions may be required to the extent that charge offs are recorded against valuation allowances for impaired loans or the general valuation allowance or if there is further deterioration of the loan portfolio 
we recorded net loan charge offs of million during  compared to thousand and million during and  respectively 
the charge offs during primarily resulted from losses on single family residential loans compared to the charge offs during and  which primarily resulted from losses on business loans not secured by real estate 
non interest income non interest income decreased to million during  from million during the decrease in compared to was due to increased losses on real estate operations and a decrease in gain on sale of loans  offset by higher loan servicing and other fees  retail office fees and other operating income 
non interest income increased to million during  from million during the increase in compared to was due to increases in loan servicing and other fees  retail office fees and gain on sale of loans  offset by a decrease in real estate operations 
loan servicing and other fees were million in  compared to million in and million in the increases in and were due to increases in appraisal fee income and brokered loan fees 
retail office fees increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increases through the three year period resulted from increases in overdraft service fees and the implementation of an unavailable funds fee 
gain on sale of loans was million in  million in and thousand in the volume of loans sold decreased to million in  from million in  but increased from million in the decrease in volume during was due to unfavorable secondary market conditions which made it difficult for the bank to sell loans during the second half of as a result  million in loans designated the held for sale were transferred to the held for investment portfolio 
a valuation loss of thousand was recorded upon the transfer 
real estate operations resulted in a net loss of million during  compared to a net loss of thousand during and a gain of million in the loss reported during resulted from write downs of real estate owned due to valuation adjustments and operating costs on single family real estate owned 
the loss during resulted from legal costs associated with the protection of judgments on properties previously sold at a loss 
the gain during resulted from the sale of investment properties which were acquired in settlement of judgments 
real estate operations include gains and losses on the sale of foreclosed properties  operating income and expense during the holding period  and recoveries of prior losses on real estate sold 
other operating income increased to million in  compared to thousand in and thousand in the increases in compared to and compared to were primarily due to increases in investment services commission income 
non interest expense the ratio of non interest expense to average total assets was for  for and for the increase during was due to an increase in non interest expense and a decrease in average total assets 
the expense ratios decreased during and due to growth in assets during those years 
non interest expense increased during primarily due to higher compensation costs  higher occupancy costs in connection with opening new branches and higher fdic deposit insurance premiums 
non interest expense increased during primarily due to an increase in ots assessments and an increase in fdic deposit insurance premiums 
salary and benefit costs increased in compared to primarily due to normal salary adjustments and additional personnel hired for new branches 
incentive costs decreased due to a decrease in loan funding 
salary and benefit costs increased in compared to due to stock option expense which was recorded for the first time due to the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment 
incentive costs decreased in compared to occupancy expense increased in due to the opening of two new branches and the closing of one branch during the year 
also  rent expense was incurred on the company s prospective new headquarters during while we were still paying rent on three facilities that will be replaced early in occupancy expense increased in compared to due to the opening of two new branches during the year  additional repair and remodeling at existing branches and increased security costs 
legal expenses decreased by million in compared to due to the favorable outcome of a pending legal matter

the decrease from and the decrease from were attributable to lower loan origination activity and a greater number of loan payoffs 
loan originations totaled billion in  down from billion in and billion in loan originations decreased in both and due to the weak california real estate market and tighter underwriting standards resulting from the implementation of the interagency guidance on non traditional mortgage product risks 
principal repayments on loans totaled billion during  billion during and billion during real estate loan portfolio at the end of  of our loans had adjustable interest rates based on monthly changes 
of these  of those loans were based on codi  were based on the mat index  were based on the cofi index and were based on other indices 
as part of our asset liability management strategy  we have maintained a high level of adjustable rate loans in our portfolio for over twenty years 
loans tied to adjustable interest rates represented and of loan originations during and  respectively 
loans tied to fixed interest rates represented and of loan originations during and  respectively 
the increase in loan originations with a fixed interest rate period was based on borrower preference for loans with a fixed interest rate as rates have come down and made the payments more affordable 
during and  we focused on marketing adjustable loans based on cofi 
we continue our belief that adjustable rate mortgages will help insulate us from fluctuations in interest rates  notwithstanding the two to three month time lag between a change in our monthly cost of funds and a corresponding change in our loan yields 
see asset liability management 
there are varying periods for which our loan payments may be fixed  ranging from one year to five years 
see business interest rates  terms and fees 
because aml loan to value ratios may increase above those established at the time of loan origination due to negative amortization  when we do lend in excess of of the appraised value  additional fees and higher rates are charged or we may require mortgage insurance which reduces our loss exposure to below 
notwithstanding a borrower s election to make a less than fully amortizing or interest only payment  which serves to increase negative amortization  the amount of negative amortization also increases during periods of rising short term interest rates 
see business interest rates  terms and fees 
at december   and  negative amortization included in the balance of loans receivable  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
negative amortization has increased over the last two years primarily because borrowers chose to make less than a fully amortizing payment during the initial fixed payment period of their loan 
the portfolio of single family loans with a one year fixed payment totaled billion at december  and billion at both december  and the portfolio of single family loans with a three to five year fixed payment was billion at december   compared to billion at december   and billion at december  negative amortization as a percentage of all single family loans with negative amortization totaled at december   at december  and at december  single family loans comprised of originations during compared to of originations in and of originations during unlike the single family real estate market  the multi family real estate market in california showed no sign of weakness during due to increased marketing efforts by the bank  multi family loan originations increased during compared to the following table details loan originations and loan purchases by property type for the periods indicated loan originations and purchases by property type year ended december  in thousands single family one to four units multi family commercial real estate commercial business loans other total no loans were originated upon the sale of real estate owned during  or the following table summarizes loan originations and purchases by loan type for the periods indicated loan originations and purchases by loan type year ended december  in thousands mat codi cofi libor prime fixed hybrid total the following table summarizes single family loan originations by borrower documentation type for the periods indicated single family loan originations by borrower documentation type year ended december  in thousands verified income verified asset stated income verified asset stated income stated asset no income no asset total on verified income verified asset loans viva  the borrower includes information on his her income and assets  which is then verified

due to commissions paid to mortgage loan brokers  wholesale single family loans typically have deferred origination costs in excess of deferred loan origination income 
net deferred loan origination costs were million at december   million at december  and million at december  the decrease in net deferred loan costs in and resulted from the lower volume of single family loans originated and an increase in loan payoffs during those years 
deferred loan origination costs are amortized over the expected life of the loans which is typically three years

in certain of these cases when we waived the insurance requirement  we purchased private mortgage insurance with our own funds

because many borrowers have elected to make a mortgage payment less than what is required by either the interest only or fully amortizing option  many of these adjustable rate mortgages are reaching their maximum negative amortization threshold and now require an increased payment 
the recast of these loans to a higher payment amount appears to have been a substantial factor in the higher delinquency levels experienced by the bank during because many borrowers were unable to make the higher payments 
we cannot predict how the increased payments will impact delinquencies in the future  but the percentage of increase in the payment amount and the loan to value ratio are important considerations

although no longer owned by us  these loans are evaluated for the purposes of measuring risk exposure for regulatory capital 
the decreases over the last three years were due to normal amortization and payoffs 
we also have full recourse on multi family loans sold to fnma in exchange for mortgage backed securities during due to the recourse provisions of the sale  these mortgage backed securities continue to be accounted for as part of our loan portfolio pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no

loan loss allowances  including the general valuation allowance and valuation allowances for impaired loans 
general valuation allowance plus the allowances for impaired loans as a percentage of loans receivable before deducting unrealized loan fees  the general valuation allowance and valuation allowances for impaired loans 
non performing assets we define non performing assets to include loans delinquent over days or in foreclosure  real estate acquired in settlement of loans  and other loans less than days delinquent but for which collectability is questionable

single family real estate owned and non accrual loans have increased during due to the downturn in the california real estate market and higher payment requirements on adjustable rate loans that reached their maximum allowed negative amortization 
because real estate prices have decreased substantially over the last year  delinquent borrowers are no longer able to sell their homes in sufficient amounts to pay off their mortgages 
also  some borrowers have taken out second trust deeds with other lenders  making it likely that the total encumbrances on a property are greater than its value 
refinancing may not be an option because mortgage lenders have tightened the underwriting and documentation requirements for new loans 
approximately of non performing loan balances were related to loans on which another institution has a second mortgage as of december  the trend towards higher single family delinquencies is likely to continue during and because the bank estimates that  mortgages with principal balances totaling billion could reach their maximum negative amortization in and another  mortgages with principal balances totaling million could reach their maximum in the bank created a loss mitigation unit at the end of to work proactively with borrowers who may have difficulty affording their increased loan payments 
as of december   four loans with principal balances totaling million had been modified 
valuation allowances on these loans totaled thousand 
these loans were considered troubled debt restructurings and included in impaired loans as of december  impaired loans totaled million  million  and million  net of related allowances of thousand  and as of december    and  respectively 
see business non accrual  past due  impaired and restructured loans for further discussion of impaired loans 
modified loans result primarily from temporary modifications of principal and interest payments or an extension of maturity dates 
under these arrangements  loan terms are typically reduced to no less than a required monthly interest payment 
any loss of revenue under the modified terms would currently be immaterial to us 
if the borrower is unable to return to scheduled principal and interest payments at the end of the modification period  foreclosure procedures will be initiated  or  in certain circumstances  the modification period will be extended 
as of december   we had no modified loans that were not considered trouble debt restructurings 
this compares with million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
no modified loans were days or more delinquent as of december   or capital resources and liquidity liquidity requirements as permitted by the ots  we determine the level of liquidity required for the safe and sound operation of our business 
our strategy is to keep cash and liquid investments at a modest level due to the availability of credit lines 
these credit lines are considered in our definition of available liquidity 
our liquidity policy requires that cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and unused borrowing capacity be maintained at a minimum level of of our liquidity base defined as deposits and borrowings due within one year 
as of december   liquidity qualifying balances were of our liquidity base 
external sources of funds external sources of funds include deposits  loan sales  advances from the fhlb and reverse repurchase agreements reverse repos 
for purposes of funding asset growth  the source or sources of funds with the lowest total cost for the desired term are generally selected 
the incremental source of funds used most often during was fhlb advances 
the source of funds used most often during was brokered deposits  and during  it was fhlb advances 
deposits are accepted from our full service banking branches  internet banking  national deposit brokers brokered deposits and telemarketing sources 
the cost of funds  operating margins and our net income associated with brokered and telemarketing deposits are generally comparable to the cost of funds  operating margins and our net income associated with branch deposits  fhlb borrowings and repurchase agreements 
as the cost of each source of funds fluctuates from time to time  based on market rates of interest offered by us and other financial institutions  we select funds from the lowest cost source until the relative costs change 
as the cost of funds  operating margins and net income associated with each source of funds are generally comparable  we do not deem the impact of its use of any one of the specific sources of funds at a given time to be material 
deposits at full service banking branches were billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  the increases during the last three years were due to opening of new retail branches and our marketing efforts 
deposits obtained from national brokerage firms brokered deposits are considered a source of funds similar to a borrowing 
in evaluating brokered deposits as a source of funds  the cost of these deposits  including commission fees  is compared to other funding sources 
we had million in brokered deposits at december   billion at december  and billion at december  the utilization of brokered deposits decreased during because they were more costly than fhlb advances on an all in cost basis  and increased during because they were less costly than other source of funds 
telemarketing deposits were million at the end of  million at the end of and million at the end of these deposits are normally large deposits from pension plans  managed trusts and other financial institutions 
the level of telemarketing deposits varies based on the activity of investors  who are typically professional money managers 
the availability of telemarketing deposits also varies based on the rates offered and the investors perception of our creditworthiness 
we began accepting deposits acquired through the internet in late by posting our rates on internet rate boards 
we accept internet deposits from every state except california 
these deposits totaled million at december   million at december   and million at december  the volume of loans sold was million during  million during and million during loan sales decreased during due to a lack of liquidity in the mortgage markets 
loan sales increased during compared to because we increased our originations of loans for sale to other investors based on their guidelines 
fhlb advances were billion at the end of  billion at the end of and billion at the end of borrowings from the fhlb increased during because they were less costly than brokered deposits 
reverse repurchase agreements are short term borrowings secured by loans and investment securities 
these borrowings decreased to million at the end of from million at the end of and billion at the end of the decrease during and was due to the fact that investment brokers were charging less favorable rates to the bank for borrowings secured by mortgage backed securities 
we believe that we have sufficient funds available to fund current loan origination activity 
we have a credit facility with the fhlb in the form of advances and lines of credit which allows borrowings of up to of our assets as computed for regulatory purposes 
at december   our unused borrowing capacity at the fhlb was in excess of billion 
actual advances from the fhlb totaled billion at the end of other sources of liquidity include principal and interest payments on loans  proceeds from loan sales and other borrowings  such as reverse repurchase transactions 
historically  we have retained a significant portion of maturing deposits 
while management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the current competitive rate environment  they are not expected to have a material impact on our long term liquidity position 
the holding company had million in unsecured fixed floating rate senior debentures as of december  the first million transaction was completed in june and is due in the debentures have a fixed rate of for the first five years and are adjustable afterwards based on a rate of over the three month libor 
the second million transaction was completed in december and is due in the debentures have a fixed rate of for the first five years and are adjustable afterwards based on a rate of over the three month libor 
the third million transaction was completed in april and is due in the debentures have a fixed rate of for the first five years and are adjustable afterwards based on a rate of over the three month libor 
the debentures in each transaction are redeemable at par after the first five years 
negative covenants contained in the indentures governing the terms of these debentures generally prohibit us from selling or otherwise disposing of shares of voting stock of the bank or permitting liens on the bank s stock other than certain permitted liens 
the indentures also impose certain affirmative covenants on us  none of which is believed to have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business

principal payments were billion in  compared to billion in and billion in principal payments include both scheduled principal pay downs and prepayments  which are a function of real estate activity and the general level of interest rates 
capital requirements current ots regulatory capital standards require that we maintain tangible capital of at least of total assets  core capital of of total assets  and risk based capital of of total risk weighted assets 
among other things  failure to comply with these capital standards will result in restrictions on asset growth and necessitate the preparation of a capital plan  subject to regulatory approval 
generally  any institution with a risk based capital ratio in excess of and a core capital ratio greater than is considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
institutions that maintain this capital level can utilize brokered deposits at their discretion 
additionally  if they achieve a sufficient ranking on their regulatory examination  they may be assessed lower deposit insurance premiums 
management presently intends to maintain its capital position at levels above those required by regulators to ensure operating flexibility and growth capacity 
our capital position is actively monitored by management 
we met the regulatory capital standards to be deemed well capitalized for purposes of the various regulatory measures of capital including the prompt corrective action regulations 
the following table summarizes the capital ratios of the well capitalized category and our regulatory capital position at december  as compared to such ratios 
as indicated in the table  our capital levels exceeded the three minimum capital ratios of the well capitalized category december  amount dollars in thousands bank s core capital

 share based payment  which amends sab  share based payment to permit public companies  under certain circumstances  to continue to use the simplified method in sab  to estimate the expected term of their plain vanilla employee options 
although the bank s stock options fit the definition of plain vanilla according to sab  because we do have sufficient relevant historical option exercise data to provide a reasonable basis to estimate an option s expected term  sab does not apply to the company 
in november of  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 sab  written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings 
sab is effective for fiscal quarters beginning after december  sab was issued to clarify the sec staff position that internally developed intangible assets should not be included in the fair value of derivative loan commitments and other written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings 
the bank does not have any derivative loan commitments or written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings as of december  therefore  we do not expect this bulletin to have a material impact on the bank s financial results 
in february  sfas statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 was issued 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this statement on january  will not have a material impact on the company s financial results 
in september  sfas statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  was issued 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 employees accounting for pensions  fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and fasb statement no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement requires that the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan be measured as of year end and be recognized as an asset or liability in the bank s consolidated balance sheet and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
the funded status is measured as the difference between the plan s assets at fair market value and the projected benefit obligation 
this information was previously disclosed in the notes to financial statements but was not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
this statement is effective for fiscal years ending after december  in connection with the adoption of sfas no

 fair value measurements  was issued 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement clarifies that assumptions used in measuring fair value should consider the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique as well as credit and non performance risk 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted this statement on january   and we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this statement on our financial reporting 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  providing guidance on quantifying financial statement misstatement and implementation eg  restatement or cumulative effect to assets  liabilities and retained earnings when first applying this guidance 
sab became effective for fiscal years ending after november  in connection with our adoption of sab during the fourth quarter of  we changed our practice for recording dividends on federal home loan bank stock and also adjusted our liabilities for accrued income taxes and pension costs as of january  these changes resulted in a million net increase in retained earnings as of january  if we had continued to follow our previous practice of recording dividends on fhlb stock  interest on investments would have been thousand lower in the bank now records the dividend when the final dividend amount is declared 
the bank had previously accrued the dividend when the fhlb declared the estimated dividend amount 
also related to the adoption of sab no 
 we reversed a thousand excess serp accrual with a thousand  net of tax  increase to retained earnings as of january  we believe the net effect of these adjustments was not material  either quantitatively or qualitatively  in any of the years affected 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 that clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
companies are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position assuming the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant facts 
if the tax position meets the more likely than not criteria  the position is to be measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities 
neither the company  nor the bank and its subsidiaries  has identified any uncertain tax positions as defined by fin no 
therefore  the adoption of fin no 
 which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
effective january   the bank adopted a change in financial reporting practice implemented by the office of thrift supervision ots  the bank s primary regulator 
the ots changed its financial reporting practice for classifying loan prepayment fees and late payment charges to record them as interest income rather than non interest income 
this adjustment by the ots led to a change in industry practice in the reporting of loan prepayment fees and late payment charges 
accordingly  our consolidated statements of income have been updated to include these fees with interest income 
the change results in loan prepayment fees being classified in the same category as the amortization of deferred origination costs 
prepayment fees are designed to reimburse the bank for loan origination costs if the loan is repaid prior to the bank recovering these costs through the interest spread on the loan 
the reclassification of these fees had no impact on net income  but did affect key financial data  such as the yield on interest earning assets  the interest rate spread and the effective net spread 
prepayment fees were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
late payment charges were million  million and thousand in  and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and capital  while  at the same time  adjusting our asset liability mix to achieve the most favorable impact on income 
our asset liability management policy is designed to improve the balance between the maturities and repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in order to better insulate net income from interest rate fluctuations 
under this program  we emphasize the funding of monthly adjustable mortgages with short term savings and borrowings and match the re pricing of these assets and liabilities 
by policy  we will either match the fixed rate period of these loans with borrowings for the same term or will hold unmatched fixed rate loans in our portfolio in an amount not to exceed of total assets 
at the end of  of our loans had adjustable interest rates based on monthly changes 
of these  were based on codi  were based on the mat index  were based on the cofi index and were based on another index 
comparisons over the last several years show that changes in our cost of funds generally correlate with changes in these indices 
we do not use any futures  options or swaps in our asset liability strategy 
assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing are considered rate sensitive 
the mismatch in the repricing of rate sensitive assets and liabilities is referred to as a company s gap 
the gap is positive if rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities for any specified repricing term 
generally  a positive gap benefits a company during periods of increasing interest rates 
the reverse is true during periods of decreasing interest rates 
the indices we use lag changes in market interest rates between and days while prime based business loans re price immediately 
however  our short term savings and borrowing costs adjust quickly causing net interest income to initially decrease during periods of rising interest rates and increase during periods of declining interest rates 
the movement of interest rates  whether up or down  cannot be accurately predicted and could have a negative impact on our income 
the following table shows the interest sensitivity of our assets and liabilities by repricing period at december  and the consolidated gap position as a percentage of total assets at that time interest sensitivity gap total balance balances repricing within year balances repricing within years balances repricing within years balances repricing after years dollars in thousands interest earning assets fhlb and other interest earning deposits investment securities  at fair value mortgage backed securities  at fair value fhlb stock loans receivable total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand accounts fixed rate term certificates fhlb advances reverse repurchase agreements senior debt total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets in order to minimize the impact of rate fluctuations on income  our goal is to keep the one year gap at less than of total assets positive or negative 
at december   our one year gap ratio was a positive million  or of total assets 
this compares with a positive gap ratio of of total assets at december  and a positive gap ratio of of total assets at december  the positive one year gap at december  decreased from the december  level due to an increase in hybrid loan originations with partially matching longer term of fhlb advances 
the positive one year gap at december  increased from the december  level due to an increase in interest earning deposits and investments at the end of the year 
another measure of interest rate risk  which is required to be performed by ots regulated institutions  is an analysis specified by ots thrift bulletin tb a  management of interest rate risk  investment securities  and derivatives activities 
under this regulation  institutions are required to establish limits on the sensitivity of their net interest income and net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
such changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates in basis point increments 
the following table shows the estimated impact of a parallel shift in interest rates on our net portfolio value at december  and december  percentage change in interest rates change in net portfolio value in basis points the percentage change represents the projected change in the net portfolio value of the bank in a stable interest rate environment versus the net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
the ots defines net portfolio value as the present value of expected cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities

the bank uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments and prepayments of principal 
the prepayment experience used is based on the bank s historical experience 
the bank s average cpr constant prepayment rate is for the adjustable single family portfolio and for its adjustable multi family and commercial real estate portfolios 
for fixed rate loans  the bank s average cpr for these loan types is and  respectively
