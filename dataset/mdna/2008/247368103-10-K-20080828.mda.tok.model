item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business outlook we are encouraged as we begin fiscal year and believe our businesses are well positioned to sustain the organic growth we accomplished in the fourth quarter of fiscal year our activewear segment will remain focused on completing the major initiatives that we began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year while we completed the funtees manufacturing integration during fiscal year  we expect to continue improving our production cost in sewing and screen printing 
we also plan to enhance our information technology systems to reduce our cost and provide better information to our customers 
we believe demand for the production capabilities of funtees is strong and we expect to grow our revenue and leverage our fixed cost over additional production in fiscal year sales of our traditional delta catalog products were solid during the fourth quarter of fiscal year with the additional fabric production from our new  state of the art textile facility in honduras  ceiba textiles  we were able to improve our in stock inventory position  which helped lead to increased sales 
we believe that on going improvement in our service levels in the catalog business will be key to our delta growth in fiscal year we have recently added new sales management in this business to target new channels of business for our catalog products 
we are  however  concerned about the overall undecorated tee shirt market  as there is evidence that undecorated tee shirt sales in the industry are down from last year and inventories at the distributor level are higher than a year ago 
this may indicate a slowdown in sales in this business and may lead to future pricing pressures 
we began production in ceiba textiles in november  reached our initial goal of  production pounds per week in june  and will continue to increase production in this facility during fiscal year  expecting to reach  pounds per week of output by the end of calendar year we also expect to achieve further productivity gains in our sewing operations  which should increase output at each of our manufacturing facilities 
our retail ready segment ended fiscal year with solid positive momentum  which we believe provides a platform to grow sales and operating profits in fiscal year we believe the soffe brand is performing well at retail 
with retail inventories lean in july  we have experienced re orders in early summer  extending our typically strong spring selling season 
we are seeing increased sales in our team sports business  driven by our intensity athletic brand 
in fiscal year  we are 
table of contents targeting to expand our presence with smaller sporting goods stores by improving our service levels to these retailers 
the soffe internet site generated record sales of soffe product during fiscal year and we expect to see further expansion of this market segment in the upcoming year 
our junkfood business continues to enjoy strong consumer appeal in all of its markets 
our co branded business with gapkids and babygap is growing and has been well received by consumers 
junkfood continues to grow its international presence  especially in japan and europe  and is expanding its licensing capabilities to further allow for foreign sales 
we recently acquired the nfl license for certain markets  including game venues for vintage tees 
these products will be introduced in the first quarter of fiscal year we are committed to growing the junkfood business and continue to strengthen the operational management team at junkfood to support the expansion of this business 
earnings guidance despite slowing consumer spending and uncertain general economic conditions  we expect further expansion of our revenue and return to profitability in fiscal year with this organic growth  we expect sales to be in the range of to million and earnings to be in the range of to per diluted share 
we believe there is considerable risk and uncertainty in the apparel marketplace 
raw material prices continue to be volatile and could further increase cost 
consumer demand has recently been solid for our products  but could weaken at any time 
the overall retail climate is difficult for apparel and we have seen an increase in bankruptcies and the closing of retail apparel outlets 
although we have made significant progress on our ceiba textiles startup and our funtees integration  further improvement is required to reach our long term objectives for these investments 
while it is impossible to predict the extent to which these conditions may impact our business  we have evaluated these heightened risk factors in setting our expectations for the upcoming year 
results of operations overview for the year ended june   sales reached an all time record for the second year in a row of million  a increase from million in sales in the prior year due primarily to a significant increase in sales within our retail ready segment while our activewear segment showed a slight improvement over the prior year  which included funtees for nine months of the fiscal year 
gross margins for the year decreased basis points to compared to in the prior year driven primarily from higher raw material  energy and transportation prices 
for fiscal year  the retail ready segment contributed million in operating income and the activewear segment had a million operating loss  which included million in restructuring related expenses 
for the year ended june  we experienced a net loss of million compared to net income of million for the previous fiscal year

lower consumer spending hurt sales in the soffe business  as our customers took a more cautious approach with their orders 
net sales in the activewear segment were million  an increase of million  or  due to increased funtees sales offset partially by a decrease in the delta catalog business 
the prior year included results from the funtees business since its acquisition on october  sales in funtees declined during the year due in part from lower orders for the fall  holiday and spring seasons  which we believe was caused primarily by disruptions during the integration of funtees into our maiden textile facility 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal year from in the prior year 
pricing in the catalog business increased during the year  however  these price increases were offset by higher cotton  energy and transportation costs 
in addition  changes in our mix of products sold lowered our overall margins 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some companies include costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold and we exclude a portion of them from gross margin and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses

the margin decline of basis points was primarily the result of the restructuring charges of million from the expensing of start up and excess manufacturing costs associated with the integration of funtees into our existing facility in maiden  nc the retail ready segment had flat gross margins from the prior year 
the addition of funtees reduced our overall gross margins in fiscal year as sales from its private label business generally carry lower gross margins than our branded business

entered into a third amended and restated loan and security agreement the amended loan agreement with wachovia bank  national association  as agent  and the financial institutions named in the amended loan agreement as lenders 

table of contents pursuant to the amended loan agreement  the maturity of the loans under the previous credit facility was extended to september   and the line of credit available was increased to million subject to borrowing base limitations based on the value and type of collateral provided  which represented an increase of million in the amount that was previously available under the credit facility 
under the amended loan agreement  provided that no event of default exists  we have the option to increase the maximum credit available under the facility to million subject to borrowing base limitations based on the value and type of collateral provided  conditioned upon the agent s ability to secure additional commitments and customary closing conditions 
the credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the real and personal property of delta apparel  junkfood  and soffe 
all loans under the credit agreement bear interest at rates based on either an adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin or a bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin 
the facility requires monthly installment payments of approximately million per month in connection with fixed asset amortizations  and these amounts reduce the amount of availability under the facility 
annual facility fees are 
of the amount by which million exceeds the average daily principal balance of the outstanding loans and letters of credit accommodations during the immediately preceding month 
our credit facility includes the financial covenant that if the amount of availability falls below million  our fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement for the preceding month period must not be less than to and otherwise includes customary conditions to funding  covenants  and events of default 
during the quarter ended june  we did not fall below million in availability and were therefore not subject to the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant 
as of june   our fixed charge coverage ratio was for the preceding months  and we expect to continue to meet the fixed charge coverage ratio for fiscal year at june   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under the credit facility 
at june   we had million outstanding under our credit facility  at an average interest rate of 
proceeds of the loans may be used for general operating  working capital  other corporate purposes  and to finance fees and expenses under the facility 
the credit facility contains a subjective acceleration clause and a springing lockbox arrangement as defined in eitf  whereby remittances from customers will be forwarded to our general bank account and will not reduce the outstanding debt until and unless a specified event or an event of default occurs 
pursuant to eitf  we classify borrowings under the facility as non current debt 
on april   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement and interest rate collar agreement to manage our interest rate exposure and effectively reduce the impact of future interest changes 
both agreements mature or expire on april  by entering into the interest rate swap agreement  we effectively converted million of floating rate debt under our credit facility to a fixed obligation with a libor rate at 
by entering into the interest rate collar agreement  we effectively provided a cap of and a floor of on libor rates on million of floating rate debt under our credit facility 
we have assessed these agreements and elected to account for each as a hedge 
in addition to the credit facility with wachovia bank  national association  we have a seller note payable to the former junkfood shareholders pursuant to the asset purchase agreement dated as of august  the seller note bears interest at  is payable quarterly  and has a three year term

in addition  in the future we may use cash to fund share repurchases under our stock repurchase program or to pay dividends 
derivative instruments we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rates 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for purposes of trading or speculation 
when we enter into a derivative instrument  we determine whether hedge accounting can be applied 
where hedge accounting can be applied  a hedge relationship is designated as either a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge 
the hedge is documented at inception  detailing the particular risk objective and strategy considered for undertaking the hedge 
the documentation identifies the specific asset or liability being hedged  the risk being hedged  the type of derivative used and how effectiveness of the hedge will be assessed 
as described above  on april   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement and an interest rate collar agreement to manage our interest rate exposure and effectively reduce the impact of future interest rate changes 
we have assessed these agreements and have concluded that each met the requirements to account for each as a hedge 
changes in the derivatives fair values are deferred and are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  net of income taxes  until the underlying transaction is recorded 
when the hedged item affects income  gains or losses are reclassified from aoci to the consolidated statements of operations as interest income expense 
any ineffectiveness in the company s hedging relationships is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of operations 
the changes in fair value of the interest rate swap and collar agreement resulted in aoci  net of taxes  of a loss of million as of june  and aoci  net of taxes  of a gain of million as of june  operating cash flows net cash used by operating activities for fiscal year was million while operating activities for fiscal provided million in cash 
our cash used by operating activities in fiscal year was primarily due to our net loss combined with the unfavorable increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales in the fourth quarter in comparison to the previous year as well as having slower collections from our customers 
our cash flow from operating activities in fiscal year was primarily due to net income plus depreciation  amortization and non cash compensation and an increase in accounts payable 
changes in working capital are primarily monitored by analysis of the investment in accounts receivable and inventories and by the amount of accounts payable 
investing cash flows during fiscal year  we used million in cash for purchases of property  plant and equipment  primarily related to the investment in ceiba textiles and upgrades in information technology systems

we may decide to further expand ceiba textiles to increase our production output  increasing our capital spending in fiscal year by an additional to million 
we will make this decision later in fiscal year as we determine production levels required to support our future business 
financing activities our financing activities in fiscal year provided million in cash as compared to million of cash provided in fiscal year in fiscal year  the cash provided by financing activities primarily came from our credit facility for use in operating and investing activities and to pay million of the junkfood seller note

our credit facility contains limitations on  or prohibitions of  cash dividends 
we are allowed to make cash dividends in amounts such that the aggregate amount paid to shareholders since may  does not exceed twenty five percent of our cumulative net income calculated from may  to the date of determination

in fiscal year  we also used million for share repurchases 
the credit facility also contains limitations on  or prohibitions of  stock repurchases  related party transactions  mergers  acquisitions  sales of assets  indebtedness and investments 
future liquidity and capital resources based on our expectations  we believe that our credit facility should be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable working capital needs  and that the cash flow generated by our operations and funds available under our credit line should be sufficient to service our debt payment requirements  to satisfy our day to day working capital needs and to fund our planned capital expenditures 
any material deterioration in our results of operations  however  may result in us losing our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and to issue letters of credit to suppliers or may cause the borrowing availability under our facility to be insufficient for our needs 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations  as of june   by future period 
payments due by period in thousands less than after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt a operating leases letters of credit purchase obligations total a we exclude interest payments from these amounts as the cash outlay for the interest is unknown and could not be reliably estimated as the majority of the debt is under a revolving credit facility 
interest payments will be determined based upon the daily outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility and the prevailing interest rate during that time 
the interest on the junkfood seller note is immaterial and therefore was excluded 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows as defined by item a of regulation s k promulgated by the sec other than the letters of credit described above 
we have entered into derivative interest rate contracts as described and included below in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of this report 
dividends and purchases of our own shares our ability to pay cash dividends or purchase our own shares will largely be dependent on our earnings  financial condition  capital requirements  compliance with loan covenants and other relevant factors

at june  there was million of retained earnings free of restrictions for the payment of dividends 
during the fiscal year ended june   we did not purchase any shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program 
since the inception of the program  we ve purchased  shares of our stock under the program at a total cost of million 
we currently have authorization from our board of directors to spend up to million for share repurchases under the stock repurchase program of which million remains available for share repurchases 
all purchases are made at the discretion of our management 

table of contents dividend program on april   our board of directors adopted a quarterly dividend program 
we paid million and million in dividends during fiscal years and  respectively 
on october   the board of directors elected to suspend payment of our quarterly dividend on common stock 
the board believes the suspension of the dividend is prudent to preserve our financial flexibility in this uncertain retail environment 
the additional capital resulting from this decision is intended to allow us to improve our balance sheet and increase our debt availability 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the adequacy of receivable and inventory reserves  self insurance accruals and the accounting for income taxes 
note to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  title has transferred to the customer  the price is fixed and determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of our sales are shipped fob shipping point and revenue is therefore recognized when the goods are shipped to the customer 
for the sales that are shipped fob destination point  we do not recognize the revenue until the goods are received by the customer 
sales are recorded net of discounts and provisions for estimated returns and allowances 
we estimate returns and allowances on an ongoing basis by considering historical and current trends 
we record these costs as a reduction to net sales 
we estimate the net collectibility of our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon this assessment 
specifically  we analyze the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we are currently experiencing slower collections from our customers as they are managing their cash flows tightly 
we anticipate this trend will continue through fiscal year in addition  we are facing heightened credit risk as the slowdown of consumer spending is negatively impacting retailers and thus increasing the risk of bankruptcies of these retailers in the future 
significant changes in customer concentration or payment terms  deterioration of customer credit worthiness or weakening in economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectibility of receivables and our operating results 
inventories our inventory is carried at the lower of fifo cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for damaged  excess and out of style or otherwise obsolete inventory based primarily on our historical selling prices for these products and our estimated forecast of product demand for the next twelve months 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if sell through of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
self insurance our medical  prescription and dental care benefits are primarily self insured 
our self insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we develop estimates of claims incurred but not reported based upon the historical time it takes for a claim to be reported and historical claim amounts 
while the time it takes for a claim to be reported has been declining  if claims are greater than we originally estimate  or if costs increase beyond what we have anticipated  our recorded reserves may not be sufficient  and it could have a significant impact on our operating results 
we had self insurance reserves of approximately  and  for june  and june   respectively 

table of contents share based compensation we adopted the fair value based method prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  effective july  under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the award vesting period 
we determine the fair value of each stock option at the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model 
this model requires that we estimate a risk free interest rate  the volatility of the price of our common stock  the dividend yield  and the expected life of the options 
the use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities measured by enacted tax rates 
we have recorded deferred tax assets for certain state operating loss carryforwards and nondeductible accruals 
we established a valuation allowance related to certain of our state operating loss carryforward amounts in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets if reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on earnings forecasts in the respective tax locations 
we had operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for state tax purposes and a related valuation allowance against the operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million at june  and june   respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk sensitivity on january   in conjunction with the sale of our yarn spinning facility in edgefield  south carolina  we entered into a five year agreement with parkdale to supply our yarn requirements 
during this five year period  we will purchase from parkdale all yarn required by delta apparel and our wholly owned subsidiaries for use in our manufacturing operations excluding yarns that parkdale did not manufacture as of the date of the agreement in the ordinary course of its business or due to temporary parkdale capacity restraints 
the purchase price of yarn is based upon the cost of cotton plus a fixed conversion cost 
thus  we are subject to the commodity risk of cotton prices and cotton price movements which could result in unfavorable yarn pricing for us 
we set future cotton prices with purchase commitments as a component of the purchase price of yarn in advance of the shipment of finished yarn from parkdale 
prices are set according to prevailing prices  as reported by the new york cotton exchange  at the time we enter into the commitments 
yarn with respect to which we have fixed cotton prices at june  was valued at million  and is scheduled for delivery between july and december at june   a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price yarn would have had a negative impact of approximately million on the value of the yarn 
this compares to what would have been a negative impact of million at the fiscal year end based on the yarn with fixed cotton prices at june  the impact of a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price yarn would have been less at june  than at june  due to our having less commitments at june  than at june   partially offset by the higher price of cotton at june  than at june  we may use derivatives  including cotton option contracts  to manage our exposure to movements in commodity prices 
we do not designate our options as hedge instruments upon inception 
accordingly  we mark to market changes in the fair market value of the options as other income or other expense in the statements of income 
we did not own any cotton options contracts on june  or june  interest rate sensitivity our credit agreements provide that the outstanding amounts owed shall bear interest at variable rates 
if the amount of outstanding indebtedness at june  under the revolving credit facilities had been outstanding during the entire year and the interest rate on this outstanding indebtedness was increased by basis points  our expense would have increased by approximately million  or  for the fiscal year 
this compares to an increase of million  or  for the fiscal year based on the outstanding indebtedness at june  the effect of a basis point increase in interest rates would have a larger impact as of june  than as of june  due to the higher debt levels outstanding on june   resulting primarily from increased working capital requirements and capital expenditures during fiscal the actual increase in interest expense resulting from a change in interest rates would depend on the magnitude of the increase in rates and the average principal balance outstanding 

table of contents derivatives on april   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement and interest rate collar agreement to manage our interest rate exposure and effectively reduce the impact of future interest rate changes 
both agreements mature or expire on april  by entering into the interest rate swap agreement  we effectively converted million of floating rate debt under our credit facility to a fixed obligation with a libor rate at 
by entering into the interest rate collar agreement  we effectively provided a cap of and a floor of on libor rates on million of floating rate debt under our credit facility 
we have assessed these agreements and elected to account for each as a hedge 
changes in the derivatives fair values are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the underlying transaction is recorded 
when the hedged item affects income  gains or losses are reclassified from aoci to the consolidated statements of operations as interest income expense 
any ineffectiveness  if material  in the company s hedging relationships is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of operations 
the changes in fair value of the interest rate swap and collar agreement resulted in aoci  net of taxes  of a loss of million as of june  and aoci  net of taxes  of a gain of million as of june
