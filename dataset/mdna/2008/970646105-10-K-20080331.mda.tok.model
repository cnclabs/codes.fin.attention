this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of all statements other than statements of historical fact  including statements regarding prospects or future results of operations or financial position  made in this annual report on form k are forward looking 
we use words such as anticipates  believes  expects  future  intends  and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements reflect management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons  including  among others  the effects on the airline industry and the global economy of events such as terrorist activity  changes in oil prices and other disruptions to the world markets  trends in the airline industry  including growth rates of markets and other economic factors  risks associated with owning and leasing jet engines and aircraft  our ability to successfully negotiate equipment purchases  sales and leases  to collect outstanding amounts due and to control costs and expenses  changes in interest rates and availability of capital  our ability to continue to meet the changing customer demands  regulatory changes affecting airline operations  aircraft maintenance  accounting standards and taxes  the market value of engines and other assets our portfolio 
these risks and uncertainties  as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations  are described in greater detail in item a 
of part i  risk factors  which  along with the previous discussion  describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations 
general 
our core business is acquiring and leasing pursuant to operating leases  commercial aircraft engines and related aircraft equipment  and the selective sale of such engines  all of which we sometimes refer to as equipment 
we have no current plans to enter into finance leases although we may do so in the future 
as of december   we had lessees in countries 
our portfolio is continually changing due to acquisitions and sales 
as of december   our total lease portfolio consisted of engines and related equipment  four aircraft  two helicopters and three spare engine parts packages with an aggregate net book value of million 
on december   we entered into a joint venture with oasis international leasing usa  inc  called wolf 
wolf completed the purchase of two airbus a aircraft from boeing aircraft holding company for a purchase price of million 
we actively manage our portfolio and structure our leases to maximize the residual values of our leased assets 
our leasing business focuses on popular stage iii commercial jet engines manufactured by cfmi  general electric  pratt whitney  rolls royce and international aero engine 
these engines are the most widely used engines in the world  powering airbus  boeing  and mcdonnell douglas aircraft 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to residual values  estimated asset lives  impairmentsand bad debts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  grouped by our activities  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements leasing related activities 
revenue from leasing of aircraft equipment is recognized as operating lease or finance lease revenue over the terms of the applicable lease agreements 
where collection cannot be reasonably assured  for example  upon a lessee bankruptcy  we do not recognize revenue until received 
we also estimate and charge to income a provision for bad debts based on our experience in the business and with each specific customer and the level of past due accounts 
the financial condition of our customers may deteriorate and result in actual losses exceeding the estimated allowances 
in addition  any deterioration in the financial condition of our customers may adversely affect future lease revenues 
as of december   all of our leases are accounted for as operating leases 
under an operating lease  we retain title to the leased equipment  thereby retaining the potential benefit and assuming the risk of the residual value of the leased equipment 
we generally depreciate engines on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
spare parts packages are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
aircraft are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
for equipment which is unlikely to be repaired at the end of its current expected life  and is likely to be disassembled upon lease termination  we depreciate the equipment over its estimated life to a residual value based on an estimate of the wholesale value of the parts after disassembly 
currently  engines having a net book value of million are depreciated using this policy 
if useful lives or residual values are lower than those estimated by us  upon sale of the equipment  a loss may be realized 
it is our policy to review estimates regularly to more accurately expense the cost of equipment over the useful life of the engines 
beginning july   we changed the depreciation estimate related to the residual value of certain engines for which marketability has improved in the prior year 
this change in depreciation estimate resulted in a million decrease in depreciation during and on an annual basis will result in a decrease in depreciation expense of million per year assuming no change in our portfolio 
beginning april   we changed the depreciation estimate related to certain older engine types in our portfolio 
this change in depreciation estimate resulted in a million increase in depreciation during and on an annual basis will result in a increase in depreciation expense of million per year assuming no change in our portfolio 
sales related activities 
for equipment sold out of our lease portfolio  we recognize the gain or loss associated with the sale as revenue 
gain consists of sales proceeds less the net book value of the equipment sold and any costs directly associated with the sale 
asset valuation 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of generally be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
impairment is identified by comparison of undiscounted forecasted cash flows  including estimated sales proceeds  over the life of the asset with the asset s book value 
if the forecasted undiscounted cash flows are less than the book value  we write the asset down to its fair value 
we determine fair value by reference to independent appraisals  quoted market prices eg  an offer to purchase and other factors 
accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
on september  the financial accounting standard board fasb posted the fsp aug air accounting for planned major maintenance activities fsp 
the fsp amends certain provisions in the aicpa industry audit guide  audits of airlines  and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting 
the fsp prohibits the use of the previously allowed accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial statements 
this guidance is effective for the first fiscal period beginning after december   and has been applied retrospectively for all financial statements presented 
under the terms of some of our leases  the lessees pay amounts to us based on usage  which are designed to cover the expected future maintenance costs 
some of these amounts are reimbursable to the lessee if they make specifically defined maintenance expenditures 
through  all such fees received were recorded as a maintenance reserve liability until such time as maintenance costs were reimbursed to the lessee or incurred by us after the end of the lease 
if our expenditures exceeded the maintenance reserve liability and  under our capitalization policy  the expenditure extended the original life or improved the functionality of the asset  the incremental expenditure was capitalized 
the maintenance reserves were considered in our impairment analysis 
in that analysis  carrying value was determined by deducting maintenance reserves from the asset s book value 
maintenance reserves were included as part of the calculation of gain on sale when an engine was sold 
commencing in and applied retrospectively  use fees received are recognized in revenue as maintenance reserve revenue if they are not reimbursable to the lessee 
use fees that are reimbursable are recorded as a maintenance reserve liability until they are reimbursed to the lessee or the lease terminates  at which time they are recognized in revenue as maintenance reserve revenue 
our expenditures for maintenance are expensed as incurred 
expenditures that meet the criteria for capitalization are recorded as an addition to equipment recorded on the balance sheet 
the change in accounting policy resulted in a revision of depreciation estimates for some engines 
the change in policy also resulted in a revised impairment analysis being performed without maintenance reserves included as part of the calculation of lease assets carrying value 
we recognized additional impairment charges in prior periods based on this analysis 
income taxes increase or decrease depending on the recognized revenue and expenses associated with the adoption of the accounting change 
income taxes would increase or decrease accordingly depending on the recognized revenue and expenses associated with the adoption of the accounting change 
the impact of implementing the fsp on the financial statements is a reduction in maintenance reserve liability by million and an increase in shareholders equity by million as of december  the analysis of year over year performance below is based on our consolidated financial statements as adjusted for the adoption of the fsp 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue is summarized as follows year ended december  as adjusted amount amount dollars in thousands lease rent revenue maintenance reserve revenue gain on sale of leased equipment other income total lease rent revenue 
our lease rent revenue for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the comparable period in this increase primarily reflects a growth in the size of the lease asset portfolio which translated into a higher amount of equipment on lease 
the aggregate of net book value of leased equipment at december  and  was million and million  respectively  an increase of 
lease rent revenues also increased due to stronger utilization of lease assets in compared to a year ago 
at december   and  respectively  approximately and of equipment by net book value was on lease 
the average utilization for the year ended december   was compared to in the prior year 
during the year ended december   engines and helicopters were added to our lease portfolio at a total cost of million including capitalized costs 
during the year ended december   engines were added to our lease portfolio at a total cost of million including capitalized costs 
maintenance reserve revenue 
our maintenance reserve revenue for the year ended december   decreased to million from million for the comparable period in this decrease was primarily due to the recording of million in maintenance reserve revenue in related to nine long term leases terminated with a single customer in that year 
this decrease was partially offset by the larger lease asset portfolio and an increased amount of equipment on lease during gain on sale of leased equipment 
during the year ended december   we sold engines and various engine related equipment from the lease portfolio for a net gain of million 
during the year ended december   we sold engines and various engine related equipment from the lease portfolio for a net gain of million 
other income 
our other income consists primarily of management fee income and lease administration fees  and increased million due to an increase in the number of engines on lease 
depreciation expense 
depreciation expense increased million or to million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in due to increased lease portfolio value and changes in estimates of residual values on certain older engine types 
beginning april   we changed the depreciation estimate related to certain older engine types in our portfolio 
it is our policy to review estimates regularly to reflect more accurately the cost of equipment over the useful life of these engines 
this change in depreciation estimate resulted in a million increase in depreciation in write down of equipment 
write down of equipment to their estimated fair values totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the million recorded in the comparable period in write downs on held for use equipment totaled million for the year ended december   due to the adjustment of carrying values for certain impaired engines within the portfolio to reflect estimated market values 
there was an additional write down of million for the year ended december  due to a management decision to consign four engines for part out and sale 
write downs on held for use equipment to their estimated fair values totaled million for the year ended december   due to the adjustment of carrying values for certain impaired engines within the portfolio to reflect estimated market values

realized and unrealized gains on derivative instruments decreased net finance costs by million for the year ended december  and had no impact on finance costs for the year ended december  during all periods up to december   we accounted for our interest rate swaps as speculative hedges with changes in fair value recorded through the income statement 
we recorded million as a loss upon extinguishment of debt in due to the change in ownership of our west series b floating rate notes and a portion of the existing west series a floating rate notes 
we are currently working with our investment banker on the second issuance of west which closed initially in august the second issuance will provide additional long term capital and the establishment of a new warehouse facility provides added borrowing capacity to fund future growth 
as part of the process  the existing west series b floating rate notes were purchased by our investment banker in and then re sold to a different investor 
also  as a result of this process  million of existing west series a floating rate notes were sold by an investor to a different investor 
as a result of these transactions  we wrote off approximately million and million of unamortized west series b floating rate note debt issuance costs and west series a floating rate note debt issuance costs  respectively 
the change in ownership of the west series a floating rate notes also resulted in the write off of million in unamortized west series a floating rate note purchase discount in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in due mainly to increases in employment related costs million  administration and insurance expense million  consulting fees million  technical services  engine maintenance and freight million and offset by reductions in travel and entertainment million  and accounting and legal services million

liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our growth through borrowings secured by our equipment lease portfolio 
cash of approximately million  million and million  in the years ended december   and  respectively  was derived from this activity 
in these same time periods million  million and million  respectively  was used to pay down related debt 
cash flow from operating activities generated million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively on february   we completed our public offering of  shares of our series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a liquidation preference of per share  or approximately million in total 
after underwriting commissions and expenses of issuance  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
the preferred stock accrues cash dividends from the date of issuance at a rate of per annum  or approximately  per month 
the first dividend payment date was march  the payment of dividends  including with respect to the series a preferred stock  is at the discretion of our board of directors 
the series a preferred stock is traded on the nasdaq national market 
our primary use of funds is for the purchase of equipment for lease 
purchases of equipment including capitalized costs totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on december  we repurchased million shares of our own common stock  or of the shares outstanding  at per share for a total cost of million from flighttechnics llc in a private transaction 
the repurchased shares were cancelled 
as a result of this transaction the total number of common shares outstanding was approximately million 
cash flows from operations are driven significantly by payments made under our lease agreements  which comprise lease revenue and maintenance reserves  and are offset by interest expense 
note that cash received from reserves arrangements for some of our engines on lease are restricted per our debt arrangements 
while we have experienced increased lease rates  these have been offset by increases in interest rates such that the spread between lease rates and interest rates has narrowed throughout the first three quarters of  although this trend has reversed itself in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of the lease revenue stream  in the short term  is at fixed rates while virtually all of our debt is at variable rates 
if interest rates increase  it is unlikely we could increase lease rates in the short term and this would cause a reduction in our earnings 
revenue and maintenance reserves are also affected by the amount of equipment off lease 
approximately  by book value  of our assets were on lease at december   compared to approximately at december   and the average utilization rate for the year ended december   was compared to in the prior year 
if there is any increase in off lease rates or deterioration in lease rates that are not offset by reductions in interest rates  there will be a negative impact on earnings and cash flows from operations 
at december   notes payable consists of loans totaling million net of discounts of million payable over periods of months to approximately years with interest rates varying between approximately and excluding the effect of our interest rate derivative instruments 
the significant facilities are described below 
at december   we had a million revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of aircraft engines for lease as well as for general working capital purposes 
as of december   million was available under this facility 
the revolving facility was amended on june  and the revolving period ends in june with a final maturity in june on november   the capacity on this facility was increased from million to million 
in december the capacity was increased further to million 
the interest rate on this facility at december   was one month libor plus 
under the revolver facility  all subsidiaries except west engine funding llc jointly and severally guarantee payment and performance of the terms of the loan agreement 
the maximum guarantee is million plus any accrued and unpaid interest  fees or reimbursements but is limited at any given time to the sum of the principal outstanding plus accrued interest and fees 
the guarantee would be triggered by a default under the agreement 
on august   we closed the asset backed securitization through a newly created  bankruptcy remote  delaware statutory trust  willis engine securitization trust west 
west issued and sold million of term notes and approximately million of warehouse notes 
the warehouse notes were increased by million to million on april  the series warehouse notes allow for borrowings during a two year term  after which it is expected that they will be converted to term notes of west 
the original term of the series warehouse notes has been extended by months to march   to allow for the conversion of the warehouse facility and to complete the issuance and sale of the series a and series b floating rate notes 
the sale of million of series a and million of series b notes closed on march  interest on the series a notes and the series b notes is one month libor plus a margin of and  respectively 
the series a term notes expected maturity is march and the series b term notes expected maturity is march our investment banker is the holder of million of the series b notes and retains the right to sell the notes in the open market in the event that the notes are not re sold to other investors prior to april   upon prior consent being provided by us 
in the event a sale of the note takes place  we are obligated to pay to our investment banker the difference between the amount paid by them for the series b notes and that amount realized from the sale of the notes  net of accrued interest 
this amount would be recorded as an expense in the period 
the assets and liabilities of west remain on our balance sheet at historical carrying value 
the net proceeds of the term notes issued by west in were used primarily to repay the obligations under our previous warehouse facility  which was terminated 
as a result of this transaction we wrote off in approximately million of unamortized capitalized costs associated with the previous facility 
we are currently working with our investment banker on the second issuance of west 
the second issuance will provide additional long term capital and the establishment of a new warehouse facility provides added borrowing capacity to fund future growth 
as part of the process  the existing west series b floating rate notes were purchased by our investment banker in and then re sold to a different investor 
also  as a result of this process  million of existing west series a floating rate notes were sold by an investor to a different investor 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded million as a loss upon extinguishment of debt in  which consists of approximately million and million of unamortized west series b floating rate note debt issuance costs and west series a floating rate note debt issuance costs  respectively as well as million in unamortized west series a floating rate note purchase discount 
on december   we closed on a new million warehouse facility within west  consisting of million of series a floating rate notes and million of series b floating rate notes 
the series warehouse notes allow for borrowings during a three year term  after which it is expected that they will be converted to term notes of west 
interest on the series a notes and the series b notes is one month libor plus a margin of and  respectively 
the facility has a committed amount of million 
the series a notes mature approximately december and the series b notes mature approximately december at december   million of west term notes and million of west warehouse notes were outstanding 
the term notes are divided into million of series a notes and million of series b notes 
the warehouse notes are divided into million of series a notes and of million series b notes 
the assets of west  west engine funding and any associated owner trust are not available to satisfy our obligations or any of our affiliates 
west is consolidated for financial statement presentation purposes 
at december   interest on the series a notes and series a notes is one month libor plus a margin of 
at december   interest on the series b notes is one month libor plus a margin of and a supplemental margin of  for a total margin of 
at december   interest on the series b notes is one month libor plus a margin of 
on july   the a margin was reduced from to and the b margin was reduced from to  respectively 
west entered into a senior liquidity facility on december  which expires on the final maturity date of the a term notes  yet to be issued 
the facility is provided by our investment bank and the maximum facility size is of the outstanding a notes and a notes once issued 
this facility replaced the requirement to maintain cash reserves for the a notes and the a notes once issued 
the facility may be drawn on any payment date should the cash flow at west be insufficient to pay interest on the a notes  a notes and any required hedge payments 
a commitment fee is payable on the facility 
the establishment of this facility resulted in the release of million of cash held previously in the senior restricted cash account in december  on december   we closed on a new credit facility with export development canada edc for a ten year term totaling million  in support of the december  purchase of two new bell ep helicopters that were manufactured in montreal  canada 
interest is payable on the floating rate note based on three month libor plus a margin of 
at december   we had warehouse and revolving credit facilities totaling approximately million compared to million at december  at december   and december   respectively  approximately million and million was available under these combined facilities 
at december  and  one month libor was and  respectively 
at december   three month libor was 
approximately million of our debt is repayable during such repayments consist of scheduled installments due under term loans 
the table below summarizes our contractual commitments at december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest payments under long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total approximately million of the above debt is subject to our continuing to comply with the covenants of each financing  including debt equity ratios  minimum tangible net worth and minimum interest coverage ratios  and other eligibility criteria including customer and geographic concentration restrictions 
in addition  under these facilities  we can typically borrow of an engine purchase and between and of an aircraft or spare parts purchase 
therefore we must have other available funds for the balance of the purchase price of any new equipment to be purchased or we will not be permitted to draw on these facilities 
the facilities are also cross defaulted 
if we do not comply with the covenants or eligibility requirements  we may not be permitted to borrow additional funds and accelerated payments may become necessary 
additionally  debt is secured by engines on lease to customers and to the extent that engines are returned from lease early or are sold  repayment of that portion of the debt could be accelerated 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  we have estimated the interest payments due under long term debt by applying the interest rates applicable at december  to the remaining debt  adjusted for the estimated debt repayments identified in the table above 
actual interest payments made will vary due to changes in the rates for one month libor 
the interest estimate excludes the effect of any derivative instruments in place at the balance sheet date 
we have paid deposits to secure the purchase  during  engines for a gross purchase price of million  for delivery from february to december as at december   non refundable deposits paid related to this purchase commitment were million 
in october   we entered into an agreement with cfm international cfm to purchase up to million of new spare aircraft engines 
the agreement specifies that  subject to availability  we may purchase up to a total of cfm b and cfm b spare engines over the next five years  with options to acquire up to an additional engines 
our purchase orders have been accepted by cfm and are included in our commitments to purchase 
the lease of our office premises in sausalito expired on december  and we moved to new offices in novato  california on march  we have entered into a new lease effective november  for the new offices in novato  california that covers approximately  square feet of office space 
the total rent commitment is approximately million and expires february  the sub lease of our premises in san diego expires in october our shanghai  china office lease expires in december we believe our equity base  internally generated funds and existing debt facilities are sufficient to maintain our level of operations through a decline in the level of internally generated funds  such as could result if the amount of equipment off lease increases or there is a decrease in availability under our existing debt facilities  would impair our ability to sustain our level of operations 
we are discussing additions to our capital base with our commercial and investment banks 
if we are not able to access additional capital  our ability to continue to grow our asset base consistent with historical trends will be impaired and our future growth limited to that which can be funded from internally generated capital 
management of interest rate exposure at december   million of our borrowings were on a variable rate basis at various interest rates tied to one month and three month libor 
our equipment leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms 
increases in interest rates could narrow or result in a negative spread  between the rental revenue we realize under our leases and the interest rate that we pay under our borrowings 
we have entered into interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk and not to speculate or trade in these derivative products 
we currently have interest rate swap agreements which have notional outstanding amounts of million  with remaining terms of between one and months and fixed rates of between and 
the fair value of the swaps at december  and was negative million and positive million  respectively  representing a net liability and net asset for us  respectively 
commencing december  we applied hedge accounting per sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to record derivative instruments at fair value as either an asset or liability 
beginning in january  derivative instruments were recorded on our balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value 
we use derivative instruments primarily interest rate swaps to manage the risk of interest rate fluctuation 
while substantially all our derivative transactions are entered into for the purposes described above  hedge accounting is only applied where specific criteria have been met and it is practicable to do so 
in order to apply hedge accounting  the transaction must be designated as a hedge and it must be highly effective 
the hedging instrument s effectiveness is assessed utilizing regression analysis at the inception of the hedge and on at least a quarterly basis throughout its life 
hedges are considered highly effective when a correlation coefficient between and is achieved 
all of the transactions that we have designated as hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk 
a change in the libor rates would affect our cost of borrowing 
increases in interest rates to us  which may cause us to raise the implicit rates charged to our customers  could result in a reduction in demand for our leases 
alternatively  we may price our leases based on market rates so as to keep the fleet on lease and suffer a decrease in our operating margin due to interest costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers 
approximately million of our outstanding debt is variable rate debt 
we estimate that for every one percent increase or decrease in our variable rate debt net of derivative instruments  annual interest expense would increase or decrease million in  million per annum 
we hedge a portion of our borrowings  effectively fixing the rate of these borrowings 
this hedging activity helps protect us against getting squeezed by longer term fixed rate leases 
based on the implied forward rates for month libor  we expect interest expenses will be increased by approximately million for the year ending december   as a result of our hedges 
such hedging activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of any decrease in interest rates  but may also protect us from increases in interest rates 
furthermore  since lease rates tend to vary with interest rate levels  it is possible that we can adjust lease rates for the effect of change in interest rates at the termination of leases 
other financial assets and liabilities are at fixed rates 
we are also exposed to currency devaluation risk 
during   and  respectively    and of our total lease revenues came from non united states domiciled lessees 
all of our leases require payment in us dollars 
if these lessees currency devalues against the us dollar  the lessees could potentially encounter difficulty in making their lease payments
