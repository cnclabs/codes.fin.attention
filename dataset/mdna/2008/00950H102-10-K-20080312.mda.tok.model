item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
see item a 
risk factors for further discussion of the most significant risks that affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
overview we are a global supplier of broadband wireless equipment supporting the wimax protocol standard  which provides a wide area telecommunication access network to connect end users to telecom backbone networks 
our primary target customers are communications service providers and other network operators that deploy wimax networks in licensed and unlicensed license exempt spectrums worldwide 
historically  our business addressed communications service providers that used fixed  non wimax wireless infrastructure to deliver services in those parts of their service areas that are difficult or not cost effective to reach using copper or fiber 
we now offer a comprehensive range of wimax solutions to support these traditional fixed wireless applications as well as the broader market for the mobile applications that wimax is expected to enable 
we are leveraging many years of experience in complex radio systems design to provide innovative and cost effective products for all types of wimax users 
we have transitioned our company over the last three years to focus on wimax product development and sales and marketing 
as a result  a majority of our resources are now dedicated to wimax based products 
since we have evolved from being the supplier of one line of broadband wireless access bwa equipment that utilized our proprietary technology to a supplier of a highly diversified suite of bwa equipment  including certain equipment that has been developed to conform with wimax and the wifi standards 
the diversification of our product portfolio has been the product of both internal research and development and targeted acquisitions 
see item business business overview 
as a result of the migration of telecommunications to platforms that operate using the internet protocol  we expect that our bwa equipment which is designed to handle communications over the internet will become increasingly important to us 
due to the projected popularity of technologies such as wimax and wifi  we also anticipate that our wimax and wifi products will become increasingly important to us 
our wimax and wifi products are designed to be inter operable with any other equipment that is wimax or wifi certified  respectively 
accordingly  we believe these relatively new products will face certain opportunities and risks that our proprietary products did not encounter 
the market for bwa equipment has been characterized by rapid technological developments and evolving industry standards 
our future success will therefore depend on our ability to adapt to these new standards and to successfully introduce new technologies that meet customer preferences 
we anticipate that we will need to continue to devote considerable resources to research and development to maintain and or improve upon our competitive position 
see item a 
risk factors our industry is subject to change as a result of emerging new technologies and industry standards and we operate in highly dynamic and volatile industries 
since july   we have acquired three suppliers of bwa equipment 
we intend to continue our strategy of expanding our business through  among other things  acquisitions of other businesses and technologies and joint ventures 
accordingly  we anticipate our future results of operation and financial condition may be directly or indirectly materially affected by our acquisition and joint venture effort 
acquisitions are inherently risky and our future growth may depend on our ability to successfully acquire  operate and integrate new businesses into our company 
see item business business overview and item a 
risk factors we have made  and may continue to make  strategic acquisitions 
our revenue increased from million in to million in  but decreased to million in the decrease in reflected the significant decrease in sales of legacy products 
we have incurred net losses attributable to common stockholders of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
since becoming an independent company  we have generated significant net losses and negative cash flow 
we expect to continue to have negative cash flows and net losses in we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  our revenue from the last three years  shown below  details the transition from our legacy products to our wimax businesses  which has caused significant shifts in our revenue stream and fluctuations in revenues as the relative contribution of our wimax business increases 
in addition  the sales cycle for new wimax customers is somewhat longer than for our legacy business  resulting in longer periods before revenues can be recognized from new wimax customers 
consolidated statement of operations data in thousands except per share data revenue wimax revenue non wimax total revenue cost of revenue gross profit margin total operating expenses loss from operations net interest and other income loss before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss before deemed dividend deemed dividend associated with preferred stock net loss attributable to common stockholders net loss attributable to common stockholders per share basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic and diluted we generate revenue primarily from sales of our systems and from services related to support activities 
revenue from services in continued to be under of our total revenue 
see critical accounting policies and estimates below for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
customer service contracts are generally of a short to medium term in nature  mostly for days and weeks  with a small number extending beyond a year 
with larger customers  we may agree in specific contracts to provide technical support and repair and maintenance services for longer periods 
service contracts are typically sold separately from sales of our systems and typically provide services other than what is included in the basic warranty 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force and  to a lesser extent  through distribution channels 
we also sell through independent agents and resellers in markets where we do not have a direct sales presence and to oems  who may sell our products under their name 
our sales cycle is typically long and unpredictable and typically varies from one month to two years  often involving extensive testing and evaluation by prospective customers  which makes it difficult for us to anticipate the quarter in which particular sales may occur 
our top ten customers accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
in the year ended december   axtel  yozan and dbd accounted for  and of our revenues  repectively  and in  axtel  yozan and dbd represented approximately   and of our revenues  respectively 
we had no other greater than customers in either or we anticipate that our dependence on our ten largest customers will continue 
in  we expect lower revenue from axtel and minimal revenue from yozan 
as discussed further in item legal proceedings  we may commence legal action against dbd and therefore the amount of sales to dbd  if any  is uncertain at this time 
see item a 
risk factors our non us sales accounted for  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
the following table identifies the percentage of our revenue by customer geographic region in the periods identified 
percentage of revenue years ended december  geographic area united states asia pacific europe africa and middle east south and central america and the caribbean total for further information on our business and geographic segments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cost of revenue consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  warranty costs  royalties  overhead related to manufacture of our products and customer support costs 
our gross margin is affected by changes in our product mix both because our gross margin on base stations and related equipment is higher than the gross margin on subscriber terminals  and because our different product lines generate different margins 
in addition  our gross margin is affected by changes in the average selling price of our systems and volume discounts granted to significant customers 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline and we intend to continue to implement product cost reductions and develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in an effort to maintain or increase our gross margins 
further  we expect to derive an increasing proportion of our revenue from the sale of our integrated systems through distribution channels 
revenue derived from these sales channels typically carries a lower gross margin than direct sales 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel and expenses for design  development  testing facilities and equipment depreciation 
these expenses also include costs associated with product development efforts  including consulting fees and prototyping costs from initial product concept to manufacture and production as well as sub contracted development work 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related costs for personnel  sales commissions  consulting and agent s fees and expenses for advertising  travel  technical assistance  trade shows  and promotional and demonstration materials 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures related to sales and marketing activities  including costs associated with the recruitment of additional sales and marketing personnel and the expansion of our distribution channels 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our personnel  audit  professional and consulting fees and facilities costs 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s business  however  we are exposed to exchange rates as discussed further below 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the effectiveness of our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  warranty reserve  restructuring costs  purchase accounting  valuation of goodwill and other intangibles  income taxes  derivative instruments  legal proceedings and stock compensation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may change as future events occur 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are dependent on significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our material revenue streams are the result of a range of activities 
management must use significant judgment in determining how to apply the current accounting standards and interpretations 
our revenues may fluctuate from period to period based on the mix of products sold and services provided as well as the customers involved and the complexity of contractual terms 
our revenue recognition policy reflects the fact that our revenue streams are primarily derived from i sales of hardware that do not require significant customization and ii services rendered eg extended warranty  product maintenance  radio planning  consulting services  etc 
in any one arrangement  we sometimes generate revenue from more than one revenue stream 
in those instances  there is an added level of complexity in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition 
management must apply significant judgment in determining how to apply the current accounting standards and interpretations related to revenue recognition 
subject to the more specific revenue recognition policies discussed below  we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price for the product or service is fixed or determinable  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
for new products  if we can reasonably and reliably estimate the amount of warranty obligations  we recognize revenue on sales of such products that otherwise meet the criteria for revenue recognition 
the following are our specific revenue recognition policies product revenue revenue from product sales  including sales to distributors and resellers  is generally recognized at the time the product is delivered to the customer 
revenue is deferred when customer acceptance is required  rights of return exist or other significant obligations remain that are essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
revenue is then recognized when these conditions have been satisfied 
the estimated cost of any post sale obligations  including basic product warranties  is accrued at the time revenue is recognized based on a number of factors  which include historical experience and known conditions that may impact future warranty costs 
revenue from sales to resellers and distributors is generally recognized only when the resellers are creditworthy in their own right or have identified creditworthy end customers for our products and services 
service revenue revenue from time and material service contracts is recognized once the services have been performed 
revenue from service contracts pursuant to which we provide services over a period of time is recognized ratably over the given contract period 
revenue is recognized on fixed price service contracts when the services have been completed 
revenue arrangements that include multiple elements in certain cases  we enter into agreements with customers whereby we are obligated to deliver multiple products and or multiple services multiple elements 
in these transactions  we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements based on their relative fair value 
revenue for these transactions is recognized on each element when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that element 
applicability of statement of position  software revenue recognition  and subsequent modifications sop since inception  airspan has accounted for the sale of products principally under sab and eitf software related to the products has been considered incidental to the product offering as a whole 
in the future  we anticipate that some of our products may include software that is not considered incidental to our products 
in those cases  we will account for those arrangements under the provisions of sop contract accounting when the company performs a specific development type contract for a customer subject to contract accounting under sop  we may adopt the percentage of completion method or the completed contract method to recognize revenues under the contract 
alternatively  where contracts under which separate units of output are produced  where progress can be measured on the basis of units of work completed  output is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established and the agreement contains milestones at which nonrefundable payments will be made by the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts we are required to assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable balances 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including  but not limited to  the current creditworthiness of each customer 
significant changes in required reserves may occur in the future due to the market environment 
should we consider it necessary to increase the level of reserves required for a particular customer or customers  then additional charges will be recorded in the future 
inventory reserves we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
as a result  we exercise judgment as to the level of provisions required for excess and obsolete inventory 
these judgments are based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
during recent periods we have made provisions against inventory reflecting the decline in our expectations of the demand for certain of our products 
should we decide in the future that actual market conditions have become less favorable  or should our assumptions change due to market conditions  additional inventory provisions may be required 
warranty reserves typically our products are covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years 
in a limited number of cases  warranties extend beyond two years 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs required to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions  as well as back to back warranty coverage that we have with our contract manufacturers 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity  increased costs or our assessment of future conditions change  our warranty accrual will increase  which will result in decreased gross profit 
restructuring costs during and  we recorded restructuring charges arising from our cost reduction programs and established reserves which include estimates pertaining to employee termination costs  the loss on excess facilities and the write down of assets to be disposed of as part of the restructuring 
when providing for restructuring charges  we make estimates as to the expected costs to be incurred 
estimates of future income from sub letting excess facilities are made that offset expected future costs 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from the amount of the reserves 
purchase accounting in connection with acquisitions  we assess the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
items such as accounts receivable  inventories  fixed assets  intangible assets and accrued liabilities require a high degree of judgment involving assumptions and estimates including future cash flows and discount rates 
in certain situations  where we deem necessary  we may use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
we used the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions  for which adjustments are made to the initial purchase price allocation for up to a year from the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation for the arelnet acquisition was finalized in  and amounts recorded for the radionet acquisition were finalized in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
 we performed our annual goodwill impairment review and the review of long lived assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of the result of these reviews determined that no impairment of goodwill or other intangible or long lived assets needed to be recorded during the year ended december  in these reviews  we may make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill and other intangible and long lived assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge that would adversely affect our results 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 or fas  accounting for income taxes  as clarified by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria of fas no 
fin requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
derivative instruments we are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of certain currencies to the us dollar  particularly us pounds sterling and new israeli shekels 
from time to time  we have entered into forward exchange contracts as a cash flow hedge of a portion of our pounds sterling operating expenses  primarily salary and facility lease expenses 
we make assumptions with respect to the amount and timing of entering into these contracts and the number of periods that we hedge  and we consider the value of our foreign currency obligations and the forecasted exchange rate 
should the spot rate at the maturity of the contract be more favorable than the forward rate  we would incur an economic loss on that particular contract since we would pay more for the foreign currency than we would have without the contract 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
legal proceedings we are subject to class action complaints related to alleged false and misleading information in the registration statement and prospectus used in july  and we may also face litigation for labor  intellectual property  contract and other matters see item legal proceedings 
we are required to assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to changes in circumstances within each case 
stock compensation prior to january   we accounted for awards issued under these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
in  we valued stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
this statement eliminated the use of the intrinsic value method described in apb opinion no 
 and requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
we adopted sfas r as of january   using the modified prospective transition method 
the application of sfas r involves significant judgment  including expected term  volatility and forfeiture rate 
results of operations the following table provides operating data as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented 
years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing bad debt general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring provision total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net income taxes net loss before deemed dividend deemed dividend associated with issuance of preferred stock net loss attributable to common stockholders comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenue revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in revenue is attributable to the continued decline in sales of our non wimax products wipll  proximity and other legacy products  which comprised approximately of revenues in and in revenue from wimax products increased in to million 
in  we made deliveries of wimax systems to more than customers in over countries 
however  increases in revenues from wimax products did not fully offset significant declines in sales of non wimax products 
geographically  in  approximately of our revenue was derived from customers in mexico  latin america and the caribbean  from customers in europe  from customers in asia  from customers in africa and the middle east and from customers in the united states and canada 
we are intensifying our focus on mobile network deployments and the new opportunities presented by these projects and our strong product line up 
these products require continued r d investment  and will not contribute significant revenues in the first half of in the short term  we continue to work closely with our longstanding customers to actively capitalize on new opportunities as carriers finalize their decisions to deploy wimax products 
we expect our legacy business to continue to decline in from levels 
cost of revenue cost of revenue decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to the decrease in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  our cost of revenue was in and in cost of revenue for fiscal included a charge for inventory provisions of million  recorded primarily as a result of the decline of our non wimax revenues in from levels and a subsequent reduced outlook for sales of these products 
cost of revenue for fiscal included inventory provisions of million  of which million related to a net charge under the yozan contract 
gross margin was for both and our gross profit is directly related to revenue except for period operating costs  including inventory provisions 
our gross margin varies primarily based on the mix of products we deliver and the composition of base station revenue that usually has a higher margin  over lower margin customer premise equipment 
during  the gross margins from the increased sales of higher margin wimax products were adversely offset by the inventory provision described above 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the year over year decrease was due primarily to headcount reductions from the restructuring activity the company commenced in july to focus development activity on wimax 
the company intends to continue to invest significantly in in the further development and enhancement of wimax products  in particular products that will support mobile connectivity 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease of is primarily attributable to fewer employees and lower travel costs as a result of our restructuring program as well as lower agent commissions 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in as a result of the hiring of new executives in this area in order to take advantage of the opportunities related to mobile wimax 
bad debt expense during and  we provided for receivables of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in bad debt expense in was due primarily to fewer uncollectible accounts in latin america 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in headcount as a result of the restructuring in the second half of amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles expense decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  due to the completion of the amortization of core developed technology in israel 
restructuring provision in the third quarter of  the company commenced a company wide restructuring program to reduce operating expenses 
as a result  in the company recorded restructuring charges of million  to reflect the total cost of this restructuring program 
in  we recorded a credit for restructuring of million relating to the reduction of a provision for certain liabilities related to a leased property in the united kingdom 
interest and other expense interest and other expense increased from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from an increase in borrowings under our bank line of credit 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to lower foreign exchange gains in of million  partially offset by higher interest income of million 
income taxes a net income tax charge of million was recorded in the year ended december   compared to a credit of million recorded in the year ended december  the tax charge was related to income taxes for certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
this tax credit was obtained from the uk tax authorities in lieu of carrying forward tax losses related to certain qualifying research and development costs 
we are no longer eligible to receive tax credits from the uk taxing authorities in lieu of our carry forward of tax losses 
no other income tax benefit has been recorded for the tax losses generated because we have incurred operating losses since inception 
deemed dividend upon issuance of stock during  we recognized a non cash charge of million for a deemed dividend to our series b preferred stockholders as a result of an anti dilution adjustment to our series b preferred stock following a public share offering 
in  we recognized a non cash charge of million for a deemed dividend to preferred stockholders associated with the beneficial conversion feature of the preferred stock issued in the third quarter of net loss attributable to common stockholders for the reasons described above  our net loss before taxes increased from million in to million in  and our net loss attributable to common stockholders decreased from million in to million in comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenue revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the first full year of sales of our wimax and as 
net products  which accounted for approximately of revenues 
in we made deliveries of wimax systems to more than customers in more than countries  and the continued growth in sales of our wipll products  which comprised approximately of revenues in growth in revenues from wimax  wipll and as 
net products more than offset significant declines in sales of proximity and asx products 
the growth in was attributable to a number of important contracts signed or fulfilled in they included deliveries of wimax products to yozan in japan  dbd in germany  pipex wireless in the united kingdom  metromax in samara  russia  and sogetel in canada 
tulip it continued to deploy its wipll network in india 
other customers like last mile broadband in ireland purchased both wipll and wimax products for their networks 
in we were less reliant on axtel  as expected  and our proximity product line as our major source of revenues 
axtel comprised approximately of revenues  down substantially from in geographically  in  approximately of our revenue was derived from customers in asia  from customers in mexico  latin america and the caribbean  and from customers in europe 
customers in the united states and canada  and africa and the middle east accounted for approximately and of revenues  respectively 
cost of revenue cost of revenue increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the increase in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  our cost of revenue was in and in cost of revenue for fiscal included inventory provisions of million  of which million related to a net charge under the yozan contract 
this charge for yozan reflects our estimate of the probable amount of excess inventories and purchase commitments net of amounts that are cancellable  based on the expected deliveries to yozan under the amended supply contract 
cost of revenue in included inventory provisions of million  of which million represented a write off in the fourth quarter of in connection with inventory shortages that were identified in the physical inventory count at our israeli subsidiary 
gross margin was for the fiscal year versus in during  the gross margins from the increased sales of higher margin wipll  wimax and as 
net products were adversely offset by the yozan inventory provision described above 
gross margins were also adversely affected in by increased freight and warranty expenses  which grew as a result of the change in mix of products sold 
a decline in sales of proximity  most of which is delivered at the production site to customers  and which has very low warranty costs given the maturity and stability of the platform  was offset by increased sales of wipll and wimax products  which were shipped in from the united kingdom and israel to all parts of the world 
we also incurred higher warranty expenses on the new wimax product line  because the product has not yet achieved the stability of other more mature products we sell 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the additional research and development expenses we incurred in connection with the introduction of our new wimax products  and to costs incurred by arelnet and radionet  which were acquired in june and november  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses is related to product marketing  commissions  trade shows and travel  largely attributable to introduction of our new wimax products 
bad debt expense during and  we wrote down receivables by million and million  respectively 
the increase in write downs in was due primarily to our concerns with our ability to collect payments from certain customers in south and central america 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of additional payroll costs arising from our acquisitions of arelnet and radionet  and to additional fees incurred in connection with our audit and compliance with requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles expense increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase resulted from the full year charge for the amortization of intangibles acquired from arelnet and radionet in restructuring provision during the second quarter of  the company recorded an additional restructuring charge of million for costs related to certain facility charges in respect of buildings in the uk in the third quarter of  the company commenced a company wide restructuring program to reduce operating expenses 
as a result  in the company recorded restructuring charges of million  to reflect the total cost of this restructuring program 
for more information regarding our restructuring programs  see restructuring above 
interest and other expense interest and other expense increased from nil in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to interest paid and accrued on loans to the company from tekes finland and silicon valley bank 
interest and other income interest and other income increased from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this was primarily due to gains and losses on foreign currency cash balances and foreign exchange hedging contracts and interest earned on cash deposits with financial institutions 
higher interest rates earned on our investments were offset by increased interest expense on our debt and lower average cash balances 
income taxes a net income tax credit of million was recorded in the year ended december   compared to a credit of million recorded in the year ended december  this tax credit was obtained from the uk tax authorities in lieu of carrying forward tax losses related to certain qualifying research and development costs 
the tax credit recorded in and was partially offset by thousand and thousand  respectively  of tax charges relating to certain of our foreign branches and subsidiaries 
as of  we were no longer eligible to receive tax credits from the uk taxing authorities in lieu of our carry forward of tax losses 
no other income tax benefit has been recorded for the tax losses generated because we have incurred operating losses since inception 
deemed dividend upon issuance of stock in the third quarter  we recognized a non cash charge of million for a deemed dividend to preferred stockholders associated with the beneficial conversion feature of the preferred stock issued in the third quarter  comprised of million related to the series b preferred stock issued in respect of oak s exchange of its series a preferred stock and million related to the series b preferred stock issued in respect of oak s cash investment 
there was no similar expense in net loss attributable to common stockholders for the reasons described above  our net loss before taxes increased from million in to million in  and our net loss attributable to common stockholders increased from million in to million in restructuring in the fourth quarter of  the decision was made to completely outsource all of our manufacturing 
as a result  a million restructuring charge was recorded for the closure of our riverside  uxbridge facility in all of this cost relates to the excess facility 
a further million was recognized as restructuring in the income statement in the fourth quarter of as we reassessed the ability to sublease the riverside facility 
during the second quarter of  we recognized an additional restructuring charge of million for additional costs expected to be incurred related to certain facility charges in respect of buildings in the united kingdom 
the lessor has already completed renovations and incurred actual costs for approximately million  which the company agreed to pay in february in final settlement 
for this reason  we lowered the restructuring reserve at the end of to million 
all cash outflows in connection with this restructuring were paid in february in the third quarter of  the company commenced a company wide restructuring program to reduce operating expenses 
the operating expense reduction was accomplished primarily through reductions in worldwide headcount 
in  the company recorded restructuring charges of million 
the company made approximately million of cash outlays in related to amounts accrued in all cash outlays related to this program were completed in the second quarter of the restructuring charges and their utilization are summarized as follows balance at balance at beginning restructuring end all amounts in thousands of us s of period charge utilized of period year ended december  one time termination benefits contract termination costs other associated costs year ended december  one time termination benefits contract termination costs other associated costs year ended december  one time termination benefits contract termination costs other associated costs liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  short term investments totaling million and million of restricted cash in current assets 
in addition  we had restricted cash of million in other non current assets 
a total of million is held as collateral for performance guarantees on customer contracts and with landlords  of which million is for guarantees with maturities in excess of one year 
the amount of million included in restricted cash is for withholding from salaries of employees under our employee share purchase plan 
all short term investments are of investment grade quality and are not subject to significant market risk 
we have no material capital commitments 
since inception  we have financed our operations through private sales of convertible preferred stock  an initial public offering of common stock  which we completed on july   a secured bank line of credit and an underwritten public share offering 
in  we had a private sale of convertible preferred stock  which we closed in september we raised approximately million net of expenses through the issuance of series b preferred stock to oak investment partners xi  limited partnership 
in september and october  the company issued  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price of per share 
all of the shares were sold by the company 
the offering was made under the company s effective shelf registration statement covering up to million of equity securities previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 
on august   we and our wholly owned subsidiary  airspan communications limited  entered into an amendment to our august  loan and security agreement the loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank svb  with respect to a revolving credit line 
for the term of the credit line  which expires on december   we may  subject to certain adjustments  borrow up to the lesser of i million and ii of eligible accounts receivable 
as of december   million of available credit was unused 
we are currently using the credit line and we expect to continue to use it in although we believe the credit facility will increase our financial resources and financial flexibility  our use of the credit facility does present certain risks 
our ability to borrow under the credit facility is a function of  among other things  our base of eligible accounts receivable and the rate at which advances are made against eligible receivables the advance rate 
if the amount or quality of our accounts receivable deteriorates or the advance rate or eligibility criteria are adjusted adversely by svb  our ability to borrow under the credit facility will be directly  negatively affected 
if there is an adverse adjustment in the borrowing base at a time when we are unable to  within three business days  repay svb the amount by which the borrowing base has been decreased  we will likely be in default under the loan and security agreement 
in addition  the credit facility requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants  including the maintenance of tangible net worth as defined in the agreement of at least million with such required amount to be increased for each subsequent fiscal quarter after our second fiscal quarter of by of i our positive net income  ii proceeds of stock issuances  and iii proceeds of indebtedness which is subordinated to our obligations to svb 
as of december   the tangible net worth requirement was million as a result of the additional share issuance 
the company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants at december  there is no assurance the company will be able to meet this covenant in future quarters as required by the loan and security agreement 
in the event the company is unable to meet this test in the future  we would plan to seek an amendment or waiver of this covenant 
there can be no assurance that any such waiver or amendment would be granted 
as a result  we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to borrow under the loan and security agreement at a time when we most need money to fund working capital or other needs and prohibit us from paying dividends on our capital stock 
the credit facility also contains various provisions that restrict our use of cash and operating flexibility 
these provisions could have important consequences for us  including i causing us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt repayment and or service rather than other perceived needs  ii precluding us from incurring additional debt financing for future working capital or capital expenditures and iii impacting our ability to take advantage of significant  perceived business opportunities  such as acquisition opportunities or to react to market conditions 
our failure to meet financial and other covenants could give rise to a default under the loan and security agreement 
in the event of an uncured default  the loan and security agreement provides that all amounts owed to svb are immediately due and payable and that svb has the right to enforce its security interest in our assets 
the loan and security agreement is secured by collateral  including all of our rights and interests in substantially all of our personal property  including accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  general intangibles  intellectual property  books and records  contract rights and proceeds of the above items 
at december   million of indebtedness was outstanding under the loan and security agreement 
advances under the loan and security agreement bear interest at svb s prime rate plus a percentage ranging from to  depending on certain financial and collateral tests 
the monthly interest is calculated based on the higher amount of outstanding borrowings or  we have issued million of letters of credit under the facility  which were still outstanding at december  see note to the financial statements 
until we are able to generate positive cash flow from operations  if ever  we intend to use our existing cash resources and the loan and security agreement  if available  together with  depending on market conditions and opportunities  the net proceeds of equity financings to finance our operations 
we currently believe we will have sufficient cash resources to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months 
for the year ended december   we used million cash in operating activities compared with million for the year ended december  the operating cash outflow for fiscal was primarily a result of our net loss of million excluding the deemed dividend of million  increases in receivables of million and decreases in accounts payable  other accrued expenses  deferred revenue and customer advances of million  million  million and million  respectively 
the cash outflow was partially offset by million of depreciation and amortization  million of non cash stock compensation and decreases in inventories of million  decreases in other current assets of m and decreases in other operating assets of m 
the net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  comprised of million  net for the acquisition and sale of investment securities offset by cash used of million for capital equipment purchases 
our net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
during  we generated million from proceeds of the public offering  million in borrowings under the line of credit  million from the exercise of stock options and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee share purchase plan espp 
we also decreased the amount of restricted cash by million 
restricted cash increases when we issue guarantees secured by cash collateral or additional contributions are collected from employees under the espp and decreases whenever such a guarantee is cancelled or shares are actually purchased under the espp 
on november   we completed the acquisition of radionet 
as part of the acquisition  we assumed outstanding loans the tekes loans borrowed by radionet from the finnish funding agency for technology and innovation tekes 
tekes is the primary public funding organization for research and development in finland 
at december   the outstanding principal and accrued interest payable on the tekes loans was million 
the tekes loans are recorded in long term debt and current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets 
we have issued a guarantee to tekes for the repayment of the tekes loans 
the guarantee covers the loan principal and interest 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these loans 
summary of contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period all amounts in thousands of us s total long term debt including interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations as of december   the company had commitments with its main subcontract manufacturers under various purchase order and forecast arrangements 
the company had bank guarantees with its landlords and customers totaling million at december  the guarantees secure payment or performance obligations of the company under contracts 
the company has pledged cash to the banks as collateral for the customer guarantees in the same amounts as the guarantees 
this pledged cash has been classified as restricted cash 
we have no material commitments other than the tekes loans  borrowings under the svb loan and security agreement  operating leases and supplier purchase commitments mentioned herein 
see item a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we are not using off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
as of december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  in  million related to investments with a purchase to maturity date between days and days 
in addition  in  we included in short term investments auction rate securities for a total of million 
we did not have any auction rate securities at december  auction rate securities are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates that are reset through a dutch auction process which occurs every days 
the holder can participate in the auction and liquidate the auction rate securities to prospective buyers through their broker dealer 
substantially all of the remaining amounts as of both december  and december   consisted of highly liquid investments with maturities of less than days 
these investments are exposed to interest rate risk  but a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by two percentage points from december  rates would cause the fair market value of these short term investments to change by an insignificant amount 
due to the short duration of these investments  a short term increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
declines in interest rates over time would  however  reduce our net interest income 
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken to mitigate this  and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis does not take into account any such action 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the following table shows our revenue by currency as a percentage of our total revenue for the periods presented year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  us dollars euros australian dollars other total euro denominated sales for the periods presented were all figures in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  euros average exchange rate of us us equivalent if if the average exchange rates used had been higher or lower by they would have decreased or increased the total euro denominated sale value by total australian dollar denominated sales for the periods presented were all figures in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  australian dollars aus aus aus aaverage exchange rate of us australian dollar us equivalent if if the average exchange rates used had been higher or lower by they would have decreased or increased the total euro denominated sale value by we expect the proportions of sales in euro and australian dollars to fluctuate over time 
the company s sensitivity analysis for changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in changes in sales volumes 
the company s operating results are affected by movements in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  particularly the us pound sterling and new israeli shekel 
this is because most of our operating expenses  which may fluctuate over time  are incurred in pounds sterling and new israeli shekels 
to manage our pound foreign currency risk we have  at various times in through  forecast our likely net spending on operating expenses in non us dollars and  based on these forecasts  we have entered into forward exchange contracts to cover a percentage of the projected exposure 
at december   we had no forward exchange contracts outstanding 
during  we paid operating expenses in local currency of approximately million pounds sterling 
if during the average exchange rates had been higher or lower by  the pound sterling denominated operating expenses would have decreased or increased by million 
none of these expenses were hedged 
during the year ended december   we paid operating expenses in new israeli shekels of million new israeli shekels 
none of these expenses were hedged 
if the average exchange rates had been higher or lower by  the new israeli shekel operating expenses would have decreased or increased by million for the year ended december  for the years ended december   and  we incurred the majority of our cost of revenue in us dollars 
equity price risk we do not own any equity investments  other than in our subsidiaries 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct equity price risk 
commodity price risk we do not enter into contracts for the purchase or sale of commodities 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct commodity price risk
