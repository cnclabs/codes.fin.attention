scantron while the number of tests given annually in k and higher education markets continue to grow  the demand for optical mark reader paper based testing has declined and is expected to continue to decline 
scantron believes the change in demand is caused by the offering of new methods such as internet based on line  pda  plain paper scanners and other data collection technologies 
data collection for non testing applications such as surveys is also experiencing a conversion to non paper based methods of collection 
scantron believes this trend will also continue as the availability of these alternative technologies becomes more widely spread 
changes in educational funding can impact the rate at which schools adopt new technology thus slowing the decline for paper based testing but also slowing the demand for scantron s on line testing products 
mafco worldwide developments and trends within the tobacco industry may have a material effect on the operations of mafco worldwide 
worldwide consumption of american blend cigarettes has declined approximately to per year for the past five years 
changing public attitudes toward tobacco products  an increase in excise and other taxes on cigarettes and a constant expansion of tobacco regulations in a number of countries have contributed significantly to this worldwide decline in consumption 
consumption of chewing tobacco and moist snuff is concentrated primarily in the us domestic consumption of chewing tobacco products has declined by approximately to per year over the past five years 
moist snuff consumption has increased approximately to per year over the past five years due at least in part to the shift away from cigarettes and other types of smoking and smokeless tobacco 
producers of tobacco products are subject to regulation in the us at the federal  state and local levels  as well as in foreign countries 
during  the us senate and house of representatives each proposed legislation that would provide greater regulatory oversight for the manufacture of tobacco products including proposals that could grant government agencies the ability to regulate tobacco product additives 
such legislation  if enacted  could potentially limit the type or quantity of additives that may be used in the manufacture of tobacco products in the us together with changing public attitudes toward tobacco products  a constant expansion of tobacco regulations worldwide has been a major cause for the decline in consumption 
moreover  the trend is toward increasing regulation of the tobacco industry 
restrictive foreign tobacco legislation has been on the rise in recent years as well  including restrictions on where tobacco may be sold and used  warning labels and other graphic packaging images  product constituent limitations and a general increase in taxes 
over the years  there has been substantial litigation between tobacco product manufacturers and individuals  various governmental units and private health care providers regarding increased medical expenditures and losses allegedly caused by use of tobacco products 
in part  as a result of settlements in certain of this litigation  the cigarette companies have significantly increased the wholesale price of cigarettes in order to recoup the cost of the settlements 
since  cigarette consumption in the us has decreased due to the higher prices of cigarettes  the increased emphasis on the health effects of cigarettes and the continuing restrictions on smoking areas 
the tobacco industry  including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco  has been subject to federal  state  local and foreign excise taxes for many years 
in recent years  federal  state  local and foreign governments have increased or proposed increases to such taxes as a means of both raising revenue and discouraging the consumption of tobacco products 
proposals to increase taxes on tobacco products are also pending in both the us and in foreign countries 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company reviews its accounting policies on a regular basis 
the company makes estimates and judgments as part of its financial reporting that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  investments  intangible assets  pensions and other postretirement benefits  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  as well as other assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from the assumed outcomes 
the company believes the f ollowing critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition the company considers its revenue recognition policy as critical to its reported results of operations primarily in its harland financial solutions and scantron segments 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and clarified by staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  sab  revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf issue eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the application of these pronouncements requires judgment  including  amongst other things  whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  whether any elements are essential to the functionality of any other elements  and whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
customers receive certain elements of the company s products and services over time 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement or in the company s ability to identify vsoe for those elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue reflected in the financial statements 
for software license agreements that do not require significant modification or customization of the software  the company recognizes software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
the company s software license agreements include multiple products and services or elements 
none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements 
sop  as amended by sop  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value 
fair value is determined for license fees based upon the price charged when sold separately 
in the event that the company determines that vsoe does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of a software arrangement  but does exist for all of the undelivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method allowed by sop under the residual method  a residual amount of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements after the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted 
implementation services are generally for installation  training  implementation and configuration 
these services are not considered essential to the functionality of the related software 
vsoe of fair value is established by pricing used when these services are sold separately 
generally revenue is recognized when services are completed 
on implementations for outsourced data processing services  revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the outsourcing arrangement 
on certain larger implementations  revenue is recognized based on milestones during the implementation 
milestones are triggered by tasks completed or based on labor hours 
estimates of efforts to complete a project are used in the percentage of completion calculation 
due to uncertainties inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from these estimates 
maintenance fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period  which is usually twelve months 
vsoe of fair value is determined based on contract renewal rates 
outsourced data processing services and other transaction processing services are recognized in the month the transactions are processed or the services are rendered 
the company recognizes product and service revenue when persuasive evidence of a non cancelable arrangement exists  products have been shipped and or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  legal title and economic risk is transferred to the customer and an economic exchange has taken place 
revenues are recorded net of any applicable discounts  contract acquisition payments amortization  accrued incentives and allowances for sales returns 
deferred revenues represent amounts billed to the customer in excess of amounts earned 
title for product sales may pass to customers upon leaving the company s facilities  upon receipt at a specific destination such as a shipping port or upon arrival at the customer s facilities  depending on the terms of the contractual agreements for each customer 
title for product sales to domestic customers typically passes when the product leaves the company s facilities 
title for product sales to international customers typically passes either when the product is delivered to a shipping port or when the product is delivered to the customer s facilities 
revenues for direct response marketing services are recognized from the company s fixed price direct mail and marketing contracts based on the proportional performance method for specific projects 
inventories the majority of the company s inventories consists of licorice raw materials 
licorice raw materials have an indefinite life as long as they are kept dry  therefore the company has not been required to establish an obsolescence reserve for licorice 
a reserve for the value of the products has not been necessary based on the company s lower of cost or market analysis 
the company determines cost by average costing or the first in  first out method 
the company also ensures that storage facilities where the raw materials are inventoried are properly safeguarded and maintained to preserve its characteristics 
advertising advertising costs  which are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses  consist primarily of marketing new and existing products  re branding existing products and launching new initiatives throughout the company 
direct response advertising is capitalized and amortized over its expected period of future benefit  while all other advertising costs are expensed as incurred 
direct response advertising consists primarily of inserts that include order coupons for products offered by checks in the mail  a division of the company s harland clarke segment  which are amortized for a period up to months 
these costs are amortized following their distribution  and are charged to match the advertising expense with the related revenue streams 
unamortized balances are included in other current and non curre nt assets in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes the company estimates its actual current tax liability together with temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as net operating losses and depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company must assess the likelihood that it will recover deferred tax assets from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  it must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilitie s and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to calculate the amount of income tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
on a regular basis  the amount of taxable income is reviewed by various federal  state and foreign taxing authorities 
as such  the company routinely provides reserves for items that it believes could be challenged by these taxing authorities 
on january   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  which prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of property  plant and equipment  amortizable intangible assets and investment in a joint venture whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors the company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include the following

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  
spacer

spacer

spacer 
gif 
significant changes in the manner of use of these assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  it measures the impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
significant assumptions requiring judgment are required to determine future cash flows  including but not limited to the estimated remaining useful life of the asset  future revenue streams and future expenditures to maintain the existing service potential of the asset 
the company re evaluates the useful life of these assets at least annually to determine if events and circumstances continue to support their recorded useful lives 
assets held for disposal are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less estimated costs to sell such assets 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
acquired intangibles are recorded at fair value as of the date acquired using the purchase method 
goodwill and other intangibles determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of the company s reporting units based on discounted cash flow models using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying values of the company s reporting units  which include the goodwill 
if the estimated fair values are less than the carrying values  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the company s implied fair value requires the company to allocate the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value 
the company measures impairment of its indefinite lived intangible assets  which consist of certain tradenames and trademarks and product formulations  based on projected discounted cash flows 
the company also re evaluates the useful life of these assets at least annually to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
the annual impairment evaluations for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets involve significant estimates made by management in determining the fair value of the company s reporting units and its indefinite lived intangible assets 
there is inherent subjectivity involved in estimating future cash flows 
these estimates are susceptible to change from period to period because management must make assumptions about future cash flows  profitability  terminal values and other items 
changes in estimates could have a material impact in the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in future periods 
intangible assets that are deemed to have a finite life are evaluated for impairment as discussed above in long lived assets 
contingencies and indemnification agreements the company records the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are contingencies  and the accounting for such events follows sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the accrual of a contingency involves considerable judgment by management 
the company uses internal expertise and outside experts  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that the company has incurred a loss and the amount or range of the loss 
when evaluating the need for an accrual or a change in an existing accrual  the company considers whether it is reasonably probable to estimate an outcome for the contingency based on its experience  any experience of others facing similar contingencies of which the company is aware and the particulars of the circumstances creating the contingency 
see item legal proceedings  and note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
pensions and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans  which cover certain current and former company employees who meet eligibility requirements 
also  as a result of the harland acquisition  the company sponsors unfunded defined benefit postretirement plans that cover certain salaried and nonsalaried former harland employees 
one postretirement benefit plan provides health care benefits and the other provides life insurance benefits 
the company s actuarial consultants use several statistical and other factors that attempt to estimate future events to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on pension plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates and the expected health care cost trend rate to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  higher or lower healthcare inflation rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may result in a significant difference with the amount of pension and postretirement benefit income expense and asset liability that the company recorded 
derivative financial instruments the company began using derivative financial instruments in to manage interest rate risk related to a portion of its long term debt 
the company recognizes all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and changes in the fair values of such instruments are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are met  the company recognizes the changes in fair value of these instruments in other comprehensive income loss until the underlying debt instrument being hedged is settled or the company determines that the specific hedge accounting criteria are no longer met 
on the date the interest rate derivative contract is entered into  the company designates the derivative as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge 
the company formally documents the relationship between hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
the company links all hedges that are designated as fair value hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments 
the company links all hedges that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions or to liabilities on the balance sheet 
the company also assesses  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items 
if an existing derivative were to become not highly effective as a hedge  the company woul d discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
the company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge based on total changes in the hedge s cash flows at each payment date as compared to the change in the expected future cash flows on the long term debt 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements it has not been the company s practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of business the company periodically enters into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language 
these indemnifications encompass such items as intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and or employment related matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim 
there has historically been no material losses related to such indemnifications  and the company does not expect any material adverse claims in the future 
the company is not engaged in any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entity or other third party that is reasonably likely to have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
in addition  the company has not established any special purpose entity 
consolidated operating results on december   the company acquired clarke american 
accordingly  the results of clarke american  subsequently renamed harland clarke holdings  are included in the company s results of operations from that date 
from december  to may   the company operated in three business segments a the financial institution segment  through which clarke american provided checks and related products and direct marketing services to financial institutions  b the direct to consumer segment  through which clarke american provided checks and related products and services and treasury management supplies directly to consumers and businesses  and c the licorice products segment  through which mafco worldwide produced a variety of licorice products from licorice root  intermediary licorice extracts produced by others and certain other ingredients  which products are sold primarily to the worldwide tobacco industry for use as tobacco flavor enhancing and moistening agents in the manufacture of american blend cigarettes  moist snuff  chewing tobacco and pipe tobacco 
corporate expenses are expenses of the company that are not directly attributable to the operat ing businesses including  among other things  expenses incurred in connection with being a public company 
subsequent to the completion of the harland acquisition on may   the company reorganized its business along four reportable segments together with a corporate group for certain support services 
the reorganization aligns the company s operations on the basis of products  services and industry 
the company s previously existing financial institution and direct to consumer segments were combined with harland s similar operations  this business segment now operates under the name of harland clarke and is referred to as the harland clarke segment 
the company also added two new reportable segments for business lines acquired in the harland acquisition the harland financial solutions segment and the scantron segment

impact of inflation the company presents its results of operations and financial condition based upon historical cost

restructuring cost reductions 
restructuring accruals and purchase accounting reserves have been established for anticipated severance payments  costs related to facilities closures and other expenses related to the planned restructuring or consolidation of some of harland clarke holdings historical operations  as well as related to the harland acquisition 
during the year ended december  and  harland clarke holdings made million and million of payments for restructuring  respectively 
payments for the year ended december  include those relating to the acquired harland operations since may   the date of the harland acquisition

capital expenditures 
during the years ended december    and  mafco worldwide incurred million  million  and million of capital expenditures  respectively 
while expenditures for future years are expected to be within this general range  future changes in governmental regulations could require the company to substantially increase capital expenditures in order to comply with these regulations

inventories 
mafco worldwide s licorice raw materials are subject to a variety of agricultural risks 
additionally  most of the licorice root mafco worldwide purchases originates in countries and regions that have  from time to time  been subject to political instability 
accordingly  mafco worldwide must periodically build its raw materials supply in order to avoid material shortages or significant raw material price increases 
shortages of licorice raw materials could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  results of operations and financial condition 
mafco worldwide believes that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including borrowings under its revolving credit facility  will be adequate to make required payments on its indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and to satisfy its working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash flow risks each of harland clarke holdings and mafco worldwide s ability to meet their respective debt service obligations and reduce their total debt will depend upon their respective ability to generate cash in the future which  in turn  will be subject to general economic  financial  business  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond each s respective control 
each of harland clarke holdings and mafco worldwide may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to them under their credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable them to repay their debt or to fund their other liquidity needs 
as of december   harland clarke holdings had million of additional availability under its revolving credit facility after giving effect to the issuance of million of letters of credit and mafco worldwide had million of additional availability under its revolving credit facility after giving effect to the issuance of million of letters of credit 
the company may also use the revolving credit facilities to fund potential future acquisitions 
if future cash flow from operations and other capital resources is insufficient to pay each s respective obligations as they mature or to fund their liquidity needs  harland clarke holdings or mafco worldwide  as the case may be  may be forced to reduce or delay business activities and capital expenditures  sell assets  obtain additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of their debt on or before maturity 
harland clarke holdings or mafco worldwide  as the case may be  may n ot be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  the terms of their existing and future indebtedness may limit their ability to pursue any of these alternatives 
mafco worldwide may encounter liquidity risks arising from its supply of licorice root raw material 
mafco worldwide tries to maintain a sufficient licorice root raw material inventory and open purchase contracts to meet normal production needs for two to three years 
at december   mafco worldwide had on hand a supply of licorice root raw material between two and three years 
licorice root has an indefinite retention period as long as it is kept dry  and therefore has experienced little  if any  material spoilage 
although mafco worldwide has been able to obtain licorice root raw materials without interruption since world war ii  since there has been periodic instability in the areas of the world where licorice root raw materials are obtained  mafco worldwide may in the future experience a short supply of licorice root raw materials due to these or other instabilities 
if mafco worldwide is unable to obtain licorice root raw materials  or is un able to obtain them in a cost effective manner  mafco worldwide s business will be severely hampered and mafco worldwide will experience severe liquidity difficulties 
in  mafco worldwide s ten largest customers  six of which are manufacturers of tobacco products  accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues on a pro forma basis for the harland acquisition and approximately of mafco worldwide s net revenues 
one customer  altria group inc  accounted for approximately of mafco worldwide s net revenues and approximately of the company s consolidated net revenues on a pro forma basis for the harland acquisition 
if altria group inc or its successors were to stop purchasing licorice from mafco worldwide  it would have a material adverse effect on the financial results of mafco worldwide  which would also create severe liquidity problems for mafco worldwide 
non operating contingent claims  indemnification and insurance matters the company s non operating contingent claims are generally associated with its indirect  wholly owned  non operating subsidiary  pneumo abex llc together with its predecessors in interest  pneumo abex 
substantially all of these contingent claims are the financial responsibility of third parties and include various environmental and asbestos related claims 
as a result  the company has not since paid and does not expect to pay on its own behalf material amounts related to these matters 
in  a predecessor of pepsiamericas  inc the original indemnitor sold to pneumo abex various operating businesses  all of which pneumo abex re sold by prior to the sale  those businesses had manufactured certain asbestos containing friction products 
pneumo abex has been named  typically along with to as many as or more other companies  as a defendant in various personal injury lawsuits claiming damages relating to exposure to asbestos 
pursuant to indemnification agreements  the original indemnitor has ultimate responsibility for all the remaining asbestos related claims asserted against pneumo abex through august and for certain asbestos related claims asserted thereafter 
in connection with the sale by pneumo abex in december of its friction products division  a subsidiary the friction buyer of cooper industries  inc now cooper industries  llc  the friction guarantor assumed all liability for substantially all asbestos related claims asserted against pneumo abex after august and not indemnified by the original indemnitor 
following the friction products sale  pneumo abex treated the division as a discontinued operation and stopped including the division s assets and liabilities in its financial statements 
in  mcg intermediate holdings inc mcgi  m f worldwide and two subsidiaries of m f worldwide entered into a transfer agreement the transfer agreement 
under the transfer agreement  pneumo abex transferred to mcgi substantially all of its assets and liabilities other than the assets and liabilities relating to its former abex nwl aerospace division aerospace and certain contingent liabilities and the related assets  including its historical insurance and indemnification arrangements 
the transfer agreement provides for appropriate transfer  indemnification and tax sharing arrangements  in a manner consistent with applicable law and previously existing contractual arrangements  as further explained below 
the transfer agreement also requires mcgi  which currently is an indirect subsidiary of holdings  to undertake certain administrative and funding obligations with respect to certain categories of asbestos related claims and other liabilities  including environmental claims  that pneumo abex did not transfer 
pneumo abex will be obligated to reimburse the amounts so funded only when it receives amounts under related indemnification and insurance agreements 
such administrative and funding obligations would be terminated as to these categories of asbestos related claims in the case of a bankruptcy of pneumo abex or m f worldwide or of certain other events affecting the availability of coverage for such claims from third party indemnitors and insurers 
in the event of certain kinds of disputes with pneumo abex s indemnitors regarding their indemnities  the transfer agreement permits pneumo abex to require mcgi to fund of the costs of resolving the d isputes 
pneumo abex s former subsidiary maintained product liability insurance covering substantially all of the period during which it manufactured or distributed asbestos containing products 
the subsidiary commenced litigation in against a portion of these insurers in order to confirm the availability of this coverage 
as a result of settlements in that litigation  other coverage agreements with other carriers  payments by the original indemnitor and funding payments pursuant to the transfer agreement  all of pneumo abex s monthly expenditures for asbestos related claims other than as described below are managed and paid by others 
as of december   the company incurred or expected to incur approximately million of costs related to asbestos related claims not subject to the arrangements described above the remaining claims  as to which it either has received or expects to receive approximately million in insurance reimbursements 
management does not expect the remaining claims to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  but the company is unable to forecast either the number of future asbestos related claimants or the amount of future defense and settlement costs associated with present or future asbestos related claims 
the transfer agreement further provides that mcgi will assume from pneumo abex all liability for environmental matters associated with pneumo abex s and its predecessor s operations to the extent not paid by third party indemnitors or insurers  other than matters relating to pneumo abex s former aerospace business 
accordingly  environmental liabilities arising after the transaction with the original indemnitor that relate to the former aerospace business are the company s responsibility 
the original indemnitor is obligated to indemnify pneumo abex for costs  expenses and liabilities relating to environmental and natural resource matters to the extent attributable to the pre operation of the businesses acquired from the original indemnitor  subject to certain conditions and limitations principally relating to compliance with notice  cooperation and other procedural requirements 
the original indemnitor is generally discharging its environmental indemnification liabilities in the ordinary course  and mcgi manages and advances all costs associated with such matters pending reimbursement by the original indemnitor 
it is generally not possible to predict the ultimate total costs relating to any remediation that may be demanded at any of the sites subject to the indemnity from the original indemnitor due to  among other factors  uncertainty regarding the extent of prior pollution  the complexity of applicable environmental laws and regulations and their interpretations  uncertainty regarding future changes to such laws and regulations or their enforcement  the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies and methods  and the questionable and varying degrees of responsibility and or involvement by pneumo abex 
however  the company does not itself expect to pay any of these costs due to the transfer agreement and the original indemnitor s indemnity 
the company considers pneumo abex s unassumed contingent claims  except for certain immaterial matters where no third party indemnification or assumption arrangement exists  to be the financial responsibility of those third parties and monitors their financial positions to determine the level of uncertainty associated with their abilities to satisfy their obligations 
based upon these third parties repeated acknowledgements of their obligations  active management of these contingent claims  discharging of the related liabilities when required  and financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements  as well as the history of insurance recovery set forth above  the company believes that the likelihood of these third parties failing to satisfy these claims against pneumo abex is remote 
federal mogul corporation purchased the friction buyer in october in october  the friction buyer filed a petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and stopped performing its obligations to pneumo abex 
the friction guarantor guaranteed performance of the friction buyer s obligations  however  and  since the friction buyer s bankruptcy filing  has been fulfilling the friction buyer s obligations 
in november  the company entered into a series of agreements with the friction buyer  the friction guarantor and others that proposed a settlement of the company s claims against the friction buyer relating to the sale transaction as part of the bankruptcy reorganization of the friction buyer 
if the transactions outlined in the agreements are approved by the courts overseeing the friction buyer s bankruptcy and then consummated  then either a i the company would transfer its interest in pn eumo abex to a trust to be created in connection with the friction buyer s bankruptcy reorganization plan  ii the company would pay million to the trust  and the friction guarantor would pay million to the trust and issue a year note to the trust for the payment of million  iii the trust would assume all financial responsibility for the payment of asbestos related claims subject to the friction buyer s assumption  and iv one or more court ordered injunctions would bar the assertion of any claim arising out of the asbestos related claims subject to the friction buyer s assumption from being asserted against the company  the friction buyer or the friction guarantor items a i through a iv collectively  the plan a settlement or b under certain conditions set forth in the agreements relating to possible difficulties in implementing the plan a settlement  i pneumo abex would continue to be owned by the company but would receive million from the friction buyer s bankruptcy estate  ii the friction buyer would be relieved of its obligations  and iii the friction guarantor would continue to honor its guaranty obligation and receive million from the friction buyer s bankruptcy estate items b i through b iii collectively  the plan b settlement 
both the plan a settlement and the plan b settlement are subject to various contingencies  including  in the case of the plan a settlement  bankruptcy court approval 
in december  the friction buyer consummated its bankruptcy plan of reorganization and was discharged from its obligations to pneumo abex 
this discharge did not affect the friction guarantor s obligation 
pursuant to the terms of the plan of reorganization  the amounts payable under the plan b settlement have been placed in escrow 
as of the filing of this annual report on form k  the plan a settlement remains under submission to the court overseeing the friction buyer s bankruptcy 
no assurance can be given regarding whether the plan a settlement can or will be consummated 
the former aerospace business of the company formerly sold certain of its aerospace products to the us government or to private contractors for the us government 
the company retained in the aerospace sale certain claims for allegedly defective pricing that the government made with respect to certain of these products 
in the sole remaining matter  the company contests the government s allegations and has been attempting to resolve this matter without litigation 
honeywell indemnification certain of the intermediate holding companies of the predecessor of harland clarke holdings had issued guarantees on behalf of operating companies formerly owned by these intermediate holding companies  which operating companies are not part of harland clarke holdings businesses 
in the stock purchase agreement executed in connection with the acquisition of clarke american by m f worldwide  honeywell agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to assume  replace or terminate such guarantees and indemnify m f worldwide and its affiliates  including harland clarke holdings and its subsidiaries  with respect to all liabilities arising under such guarantees 
in addition  various other legal proceedings  claims and investigations are pending against the company  including those relating to commercial transactions  product liability  environmental  safety and health matters and other matters 
most of these matters are covered by insurance  subject to deductibles and maximum limits  and by third party indemnities 
in the opinion of management  based upon the information available at this time  the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

unanticipated internal control deficiencies or weaknesses 
the company encourages investors to read carefully the risk factors in the section entitled risk factors for a description of certain risks that could  among other things  cause actual results to differ from these forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company has exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
at december   harland clarke holdings had  million of term loans outstanding under its credit agreement  million of letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility  million of floating rate senior notes and million of fixed rate senior notes 
at december   mafco worldwide had million of term loans outstanding under its credit agreement and million of letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility 
all of these outstanding loans bear interest at variable rates  with the exception of the million of fixed rate senior notes 
accordingly  the company is subject to risk due to changes in interest rates 
the company believes that a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to its floating rate debt outstanding at december  would have resulted in an increase or decrease in its interest expense for the year ended december  of a pproximately million 
in order to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on a portion of the outstanding variable rate debt  the company entered into interest rate derivative transactions in and in the form of swaps for harland clarke holdings with notional amounts totaling million and a collar for mafco worldwide with a notional amount of million  as further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the harland clarke holdings derivatives swap the underlying variable rate for a fixed rate ranging from to 
the mafco worldwide collar caps the underlying variable rate at and sets a floor at 
as of december   the company s net foreign currency market exposures were million 
this is the value of the equity of the investments in the foreign subsidiaries in france  ireland  canada  israel and china 
most of the company s export sales and purchases of licorice raw materials are made in us dollars 
mafco worldwide s french subsidiary sells in several foreign currencies as well as us dollar and purchases raw materials principally in us dollars 
mafco worldwide s chinese subsidiaries primarily sell finished products and purchase raw materials in us dollars 
since the exposures are not material on these transactions  the company does not generally hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
a appreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the prevailing market rates would result in a million increase in the related assets or liabilities 
conversely  a depreciation in these currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a million decrease in the related assets or liabilities 
the recent negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities ars 
the company s investments included million of ars held by m f worldwide as of december  and the date of this filing 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are reported as current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at market value 
these types of ars investments are backed by student loans and all have credit ratings of aaa or aaa 
the company does not own any other type of ars investments 
the ars held by the company are securities with long term nominal maturities for which the interest rates reset every days by an auction process 
historically  these types of ars investments have been highly liquid 
beginning in february  there was insufficient demand at auction also known as failure to settle for ars investments backed by student loans  including auctions for ars investments held by m f worldwide 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms until the next successful auction  however  liquidity will be limited until there is a successful auction or until such time as other markets for these ars investments develop 
the company believes that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing its ars investments has not been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these ars investments 
management does not believe that these investments are impaired or that they will n ot be settled in the short term  although the market for these investments is presently uncertain 
in the event the company needs to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  it will not be able to do so without the possible loss of principal  until a future auction for these investments is successful or they are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
the company does not have a need to access these funds for operational purposes for the foreseeable future 
the company will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments on an ongoing basis for impairment or for the need to reclassify to long term investments
