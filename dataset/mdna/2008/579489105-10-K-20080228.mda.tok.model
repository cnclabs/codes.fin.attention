the transaction is expected to close in the first four months of  subject to regulatory approval 
the sale will not affect the company s purchase commitment 
the company primarily uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in unconsolidated companies 
raw materials during fiscal  the company consumed approximately  metric tons of newsprint compared to  metric tons in fiscal for its continuing operations 
the increase in tons consumed was primarily due to the additional newspapers from the acquisition  offset partially by the conversion to lighter weight newsprint at certain newspapers and reduced circulation volumes 
the company currently obtains its supply of newsprint from a number of suppliers in addition to ponderay and sp primarily under long term contracts 
the company s earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices 
newsprint expense accounted for of total operating expenses  excluding goodwill and masthead impairment  in fiscal and in any significant increase in newsprint prices and resulting impact on the company s operating expenses and net income would be partially mitigated by the company s ownership interests in newsprint producers 
hence  an increase in newsprint prices  while negatively affecting operating expenses  would increase its share of

competition the company s newspapers  direct marketing programs and internet sites compete for advertising revenues and readers time with television  radio  other internet sites  direct mail companies  free shoppers  suburban neighborhood and national newspapers and other publications  and billboard companies  among others 
in some of its markets  the company s newspapers also compete with other newspapers published in nearby cities and towns 
competition for advertising is generally based upon circulation levels  readership demographics  price  internet usage and advertiser results  while competition for circulation and readership is generally based upon the content  journalistic quality  service and the price of the newspaper 
the company s major daily newspapers lead their direct local newspaper competitors in both advertising linage and general circulation and readership in their respective markets  and its internet sites are generally the leading local sites in each of the company s major daily newspaper markets  based upon research conducted by the company and various independent sources 
nonetheless  the company has experienced a greater shift of advertising in the classified categories to online advertising and faces greater competition  particularly in the areas of employment  automotive and real estate advertising  by online competitors 
employees labor as of december   the company had  full and part time employees equating to  full time equivalent employees  of whom approximately were represented by unions

for all of those statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of you should understand that the following important factors  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this document and in the documents which we incorporate by reference  could affect the future results of mcclatchy and could cause those future results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements deterioration of general economic  market or business conditions  especially in any of the markets where we operate newspapers  impact of any litigation or any potential litigation  geo political uncertainties including the risk of war  changes in newsprint prices and or printing and distribution costs from anticipated levels  changes in interest rates  changes in pension assets and liabilities  increased competition from newspapers  internet sites or other forms of media reaching the markets we serve  increased consolidation among major retailers in our markets or other events depressing the level of advertising  changes in our ability to negotiate and obtain favorable terms under collective bargaining agreements with unions  competitive action by other companies  difficulties in servicing our debt obligations  other occurrences leading to decreased circulation and diminished revenues from retail  classified and national advertising  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
additional information regarding certain risks the company has significant competition in the market for news and advertising which may reduce its advertising and circulation revenues in the future 
the company s primary source of revenue is advertising  followed by circulation revenues 
in recent years  the advertising industry generally has experienced a secular shift toward internet advertising and away from other traditional media 
in addition  the company s circulation has declined over the last two years  reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry including consumer migration toward the internet and other media for news and information 
the company has attempted to take advantage of the growth of online media and advertising by operating local internet sites in each of its daily newspaper markets  but faces increasing competition from other online sources for both advertising and circulation revenues 
this increased competition has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the company s business and financial results  including negatively impacting revenues and margins 
declines in general economic and business conditions  particularly the real estate led declines in california and florida  subject the company to risks of declines in advertising revenues 
classified advertising revenues have continued to decline since late and advertising results declined across the board in fiscal year  but particularly in real estate advertising 
real estate advertising began to weaken in the fourth fiscal quarter of and has declined substantially since then 
a total of of the company s advertising declines in fiscal compared to pro forma fiscal came from california and florida  two regions that benefited strongly from the real estate boom  and are likewise being hurt in the subsequent real estate slowdown 
advertising revenues were down in these regions in fiscal year the housing sector is an important component of these states economies 
hence  california and florida also 
table of contents account for a majority of the decline in auto and employment advertising  as the real estate downturn appears to be having an impact on these categories as well 
the deterioration of general economic and business conditions in california and florida  may continue to have an adverse effect on the company s business and financial results  including negatively impacting revenues and margins 
the economic downturn and the decline in the price of the company s publicly traded stock may result in goodwill and masthead impairment charges 
the company recorded goodwill and masthead impairment charges of billion in reflecting the economic downturn  particularly in california and florida  and the decline in the price of the company s publicly traded common stock 
should general economic  market or business conditions continue to decline  and continue to have an negative impact on the company s stock price  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges 
the company has billion in total consolidated debt which subjects the company to significant interest and credit risk 
as of december   the company had approximately billion in total consolidated debt outstanding 
this debt could increase the company s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
debt service costs are subject to interest rate changes as well as any changes in the company s credit ratings 
negative changes in credit ratings could increase the level of debt service costs and also affect the company s future ability to refinance certain maturing debt  or affect the ultimate structure of such refinancing 
on november   standard poors lowered its ratings on the company 
the corporate credit rating was lowered to bb from bb  with a negative rating outlook 
on january   moody s investor services downgraded the company s corporate credit rating to ba from ba 
the company expects that over the next several years its primary use of cash flow from operations will be to reduce debt 
in addition  the company expects to use sales proceeds of certain assets to repay debt 
such proceeds from the sale of land in miami and sp newsprint company discussed below are subject to the consummation of the transactions 
the company requires newsprint for operations and  therefore  its operating results may be adversely affected if the price of newsprint increases 
newsprint is the major component of our cost of raw materials 
newsprint accounted for of mcclatchy s operating expenses  excluding goodwill and masthead impairment  for fiscal accordingly  our earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices 
we have not attempted to hedge fluctuations in the normal purchases of newsprint or enter into contracts with embedded derivatives for the purchase of newsprint 
if the price of newsprint increases materially  our operating results could be adversely affected 
if our newsprint suppliers experience labor unrest  transportation difficulties or other supply disruptions  our ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired and or the cost of the newsprint could increase  both of which would negatively affect our operating results 
the company has entered into an agreement to sell sp  but if the purchase and sale agreement for sp is terminated after it has been executed  the company may be required to make an equity contribution to pay down debt and fund liquidity needs 
on january   the company entered into a partner support agreement  along with the other general partners  with regard to sp newsprint co 
sp 
mcclatchy is an equal one third partner in sp 
on january   the company announced that it has entered into an agreement  along with the other general partners of sp  to sell the partnership interests of sp for million in cash 
the acquisition is expected to close during the first four months of  subject to regulatory approval 
the partner support agreement stipulates that in the event that a purchase and sale agreement for sp is terminated after it has been executed  the partners shall make a cash equity contribution to sp of no greater than million per partner to pay down debt and fund liquidity needs 
the completion of this sales transaction  as well as the sale of land in miami may be affected by further disruption in the credit markets 

table of contents a portion of the company s employees are members of unions and if the company experiences labor unrest  its ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired 
if mcclatchy experiences labor unrest  our ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired 
the results of future labor negotiations could harm our operating results 
our newspapers have not endured a labor strike for decades 
however  we cannot ensure that a strike will not occur at one or more of our newspapers in the future 
as of december   approximately of our full time and part time employees were represented by unions 
most of the company s union represented employees are currently working under labor agreements  which expire at various times 
mcclatchy faces collective bargaining upon the expirations of these labor agreements 
even if our newspapers do not suffer a labor strike  the company s operating results could be harmed if the results of labor negotiations restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our newspaper operations 
the company has invested in certain internet ventures  but such ventures may not be as successful as expected which could adversely affect the results of operations of the company 
the company continues to evaluate its business and make strategic investments in digital ventures  either alone or with partners  to further its growth in its online businesses 
there can be no assurances that these investments or partnerships will result in growth in advertising or will produce equity income or capital gains in future years

the company s primary source of revenue is advertising  which accounts for roughly of the company s revenue in any given year in fiscal 
while percentages vary from year to year and from newspaper to newspaper  retail advertising carried as a part of newspapers run of press or rop advertising or in advertising inserts placed in newspapers preprint advertising generally contributes roughly of advertising revenues at the company s newspapers in fiscal 
recent trends have been for certain national or regional retailers to use greater preprint and online advertising and less rop advertising  although that trend shifts from time to time 
nonetheless  rop advertising still makes up the majority of retail advertising 
classified advertising including online classified advertising primarily in automotive  employment and real estate categories  generally contributes about of advertising revenue in fiscal 
over the last several years there has been a shift in classified advertising from print to online  particularly in the employment and automotive categories 
national advertising generally contributes about of total advertising in fiscal 
direct marketing and other advertising make up the remainder of the company s advertising revenues 
circulation revenues contribute roughly in fiscal of the company s newspaper revenues  depending upon the size and locale of the newspaper 
most newspapers are delivered by independent contractors 
circulation revenues are recorded net of direct delivery costs 
see the following results of operations for a discussion of the company s revenue performance and contribution by category for fiscal  and critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the most significant areas involving estimates and assumptions are revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  amortization and or impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  pension and post retirement expenses  insurance reserves  and the company s accounting for income taxes 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  in particular  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues from advertising placed in a newspaper and or on a website over the advertising contract period or as services are delivered  as appropriate  and recognizes circulation revenues as newspapers are delivered over the applicable subscription term 
circulation revenues are recorded net of direct delivery costs 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
revenues are recorded net of estimated incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance account for estimated losses resulting from the risk its customers will not make required payments 
generally  the company uses the aging of accounts receivable  reserving for all accounts due days or longer  to establish allowances for losses on accounts receivable 
however  if the company becomes aware that the financial condition of a customer has deteriorated  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances are reserved 
acquisition accounting pursuant to emerging issues task force no 
 determination of the measurement date for the market price of acquirer securities issued in a purchase business combination  mcclatchy common stock issued on june  was valued based upon the average closing price of the mcclatchy s common stock from march  through march  two business days before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced  or per share 
as a result  the fair value of the million shares of the mcclatchy s common stock issued in the acquisition was recorded at billion  which was included in the total acquisition purchase price of approximately billion 
the fair value of such shares declined to approximately billion as of the acquisition closing date june   however  the decline of million in valuation had no effect on the total acquisition purchase price recorded 
this difference is included in the allocation to goodwill in the allocation of the purchase price  and was written off in the goodwill impairment charges taken in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 business combinations  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values as of june   the date of the acquisition 
discontinued operations on june   the company acquired knight ridder and subsequently sold of the daily newspapers acquired in the acquisition 
four of the newspaper sales closed concurrently with the closing of the acquisition and eight were held by the company from two to days 
on march   the company sold the minneapolis star tribune newspaper 
as a result  the company has recorded the results of the eight former knight ridder newspapers and the star tribune newspaper as discontinued operations  including interest on debt related to the purchase of the newspapers 
no gain or loss was recorded on the sale of the former knight ridder newspapers  but discontinued operations in does reflect a write down of the star tribune s net assets to fair market value based upon its sales proceeds 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more discussion of discontinued operations 
goodwill and intangible impairment the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 the company tests for goodwill annually at year end or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the required two step approach uses accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
impairment testing is done at a reporting unit level 
the company performs this testing at its four newspaper operating segments  which are also considered reporting units under sfas no 
an impairment loss generally is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimates and judgments that most significantly affect the fair value calculation are assumptions related to revenue growth  newsprint prices  compensation levels  discount rate and private and public market trading multiples for newspaper assets 
the sum of the fair values of the reporting units is 
table of contents reconciled to the company s current market capitalization based upon the most recent stock market price plus an estimated control premium  and factors in the fair value of the company s publicly traded debt 
the company determined that it should perform its impairment testing of goodwill as of september   due to the continuing challenging business conditions and the resulting weakness in the company s stock price as of the end of its third quarter and performed its annual testing at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment charges taken 
newspaper mastheads newspaper titles and website domain names are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually at year end  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each newspaper masthead with its carrying amount 
the company performed impairment tests on newspaper mastheads as of september  and december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment charges taken 
intangible assets subject to amortization primarily advertiser and subscriber lists are tested for recoverability whenever events or change in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of each asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of such asset group 
the company performed impairment tests on its long lived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization as of september  and december  no impairment loss was recognized on intangible assets subject to amortization 
pension and post retirement benefits the company has significant pension and post retirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including salary rate increases  discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in establishing these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future because of changes resulting from fluctuations in the company s employee headcount and or changes in the various assumptions 
fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans requires recognition of the funded status of a pension plan difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation and funded status of a post retirement plan difference between the plan assets at fair value and the accumulated benefit obligation  as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
as required  the company adopted this statement on december  and its net retirement obligations in excess of retirement plans assets at december  were million 
this amount included million for non qualified plans that do not have assets 
obligations in excess of assets for qualified plans netted to a million liability at december  at december  net retirement obligations in excess of retirement plans assets were million 
this amount included million for non qualified plans that do not have assets 
obligations in excess of qualified plans netted to a million liability at december  the company used discount rates of to  assumed salary rate increases of to and an assumed long term return on assets of to calculate its retirement expenses in  based upon consultation with its outside actuaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more in depth discussion of the company s policies in setting its key assumptions related to these obligations 
for fiscal  a change in the weighted average rates would have had the following impact on the company s net benefit cost a decrease of basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million  and an increase of basis points in the future compensation rate would have increased the company s net benefit cost by approximately million 

table of contents income taxes the company s current and deferred tax income provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
these estimates are reviewed and adjusted  if needed  throughout the year 
adjustments between the company s estimates and the actual results of filed returns are recorded when identified 
the amount of income taxes paid is subject to periodic audits by federal and state taxing authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
these audits may challenge certain aspects of the company s tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions 
income tax contingencies are accounted for in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  and require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future periods 
insurance the company is insured for workers compensation using both self insurance and large deductible programs 
the company relies on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate provision for insurance claims 
the company used a discount rate of to calculate workers compensation reserves as of december  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate or a increase in claims would have had an immaterial effect on total workers compensation reserves 
stock based compensation the company implemented financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payments sfas r  at the beginning of fiscal and recorded share based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the methodology of calculating stock based compensation

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions 
disposition transaction on march   the company sold the minneapolis star tribune and other publications and websites related to the newspaper for million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company entered into an agreement to sell star tribune and therefore  recorded a write down of the star tribune s net assets to fair market value based on the expected sale proceeds and included this after tax charge of million in discontinued operations 
the company expects to receive a total income tax benefit of approximately million related to the sale 
as of december   million of the income tax benefit has been recorded as an income tax refund on the consolidated balance sheet  approximately million was recouped through reductions to income taxes payable 

table of contents the results of star tribune s operations  including interest on debt incurred to purchase it  have been recorded as discontinued operations in all periods presented 
the company used the proceeds from the sale of the star tribune to reduce debt 
impairment of goodwill and newspaper mastheads management performed its testing of impairment of goodwill and newspaper mastheads as of september   due to the continuing challenging business conditions and the resulting weakness in the company s stock price as of the end of its third quarter and again at december  for its annual impairment testing 
the fair value of the company s reporting units for goodwill impairment testing and individual newspaper mastheads were estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows  using estimates  judgments and assumptions  that management believes were appropriate in the circumstances 
the sum of the fair values of the reporting units was then reconciled to the company s current market capitalization based upon the most recent stock market price plus an estimated control premium  and factors in the fair value of the company s publicly traded debt 
as a result  the company recorded impairment charges related to goodwill of billion and newspaper masthead impairment charges of million in approximately half of the impairment charges were recorded in the third quarter of a portion of the goodwill impairment charge resulted from the accounting treatment of the value of common stock issued in the acquisition  which resulted in additional goodwill being recorded 
advertising revenues classified advertising revenues have continued to decline since late and advertising results declined across the board in fiscal year  but particularly in real estate advertising 
real estate advertising began to weaken in the fourth fiscal quarter of and has declined substantially since then 
the company has seen significant declines in california and florida  where real estate values and thus advertising were strong in fiscal year see discussion below 
the decline in automotive classified advertising reflected an industry wide decline that began in  while employment advertising declined in most markets since the third fiscal quarter of national advertising also declined in fiscal year reflecting a slowdown in a number of segments including telecommunications  national automotive and financial advertising 
a total of of the company s advertising declines in fiscal compared to pro forma fiscal came from california and florida  two regions that benefited strongly from the real estate boom  and are likewise being hurt in the subsequent real estate slowdown 
advertising revenues were down in these regions in fiscal year the housing sector is an important component of these states economies 
hence  california and florida also account for a majority of the decline in auto and employment advertising  as the real estate downturn appears to be having an impact on these categories as well 
these states have experienced real estate related advertising downturn and recovery cycles in the past and were among the company s best performing regions in management believes a significant portion of the current advertising downturn reflects these cyclical forces and expects declines to continue into because of the difficult trends in these states

newsprint newsprint prices declined in fiscal year after a sustained period of increasing prices from through early management expects newsprint prices to increase in based upon notifications from the company s suppliers 
through fiscal  newsprint expense was lower than pro forma newsprint expense which includes the knight ridder newspapers  but excludes the minneapolis star tribune in fiscal  primarily reflecting lower newsprint usage and  to a lesser degree  lower newsprint prices 
newsprint pricing is dependent on global demand and supply for newsprint 
significant changes in newsprint prices can increase or decrease the company s operating expenses and therefore  directly affect the company s operating results 
however  because the company has ownership interests in newsprint producers ponderay and sp  an increase in newsprint prices  while negatively affecting the company s operating expenses  would increase its 
table of contents share of earnings from these investments 
a decline in newsprint prices would have the opposite effect 
ponderay and sp are also impacted by the higher cost of energy and fiber used in the papermaking process

sp  to sell the partnership interests of sp for million in cash

in this standard  the fasb clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years
