overview we are a leading national distributor of natural  organic and specialty foods and non food products in the united states 
we carry more than  high quality natural  organic and specialty foods and non food products  consisting of national brand  regional brand  private label and master distribution products  in six product categories grocery and general merchandise  produce  perishables and frozen foods  nutritional supplements  bulk and food service products and personal care items 
we serve more than  customers primarily located across the united states  the majority of which can be classified into one of the following categories independently owned natural products retailers  supernatural chains  which are comprised of large chains of natural foods supermarkets  and conventional supermarkets 
our other distribution channels include food service  international and buying clubs 
our operations are comprised of three principal operating divisions 
these operating divisions are our wholesale division  which includes our broadline natural and organic distribution business  our specialty distribution business  albert s  which is a leading distributor of organically grown produce and perishable items  and select nutrition  which distributes vitamins  minerals and supplements  our retail division  consisting of nrg  which operates our natural products retail stores  and 
table of contents our manufacturing division  which is comprised of hershey imports  which specializes in the international importation  roasting and packaging of nuts  dried fruit  seeds  trail mixes  natural and organic products  and confections  and our branded product lines 
in recent years  our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the continued growth of the natural and organic products industry in general  increased market share through our high quality service and a broader product selection  and the acquisition of  or merger with  natural and specialty products distributors  the expansion of our existing distribution centers  the construction of new distribution centers  and the development of our own line of natural and organic branded products 
through these efforts  we believe that we have been able to broaden our geographic penetration  expand our customer base  enhance and diversify our product selections and increase our market share 
we have been the primary distributor to whole foods market  our largest customer  for more than years 
in august  whole foods market and wild oats markets completed their merger  as a result of which  wild oats markets became a wholly owned subsidiary of whole foods market 
we had served as the primary distributor of natural and organic foods and non food products for wild oats markets prior to the merger  and our relationship with whole foods market expanded to cover the former wild oats markets stores retained by whole foods market following the merger 
on a combined basis  and excluding sales to wild oats markets former henry s and sun harvest store locations which were sold by whole foods market to a subsidiary of smart final inc on september   whole foods market and wild oats markets accounted for approximately and of our net sales for the years ended august  and july   respectively 
on november   we acquired dhi and millbrook for total cash consideration of million  consisting of the million purchase price and million of related transaction fees  subject to certain adjustments set forth in the merger agreement 
our unfi specialty distribution division is comprised of dhi and millbrook 
our specialty distribution division operates distribution centers located in massachusetts  new jersey  and arkansas  with customers throughout the united states 
through our specialty distribution division s three distribution centers  which provide approximately million square feet of warehouse space  we distribute specialty food items including ethnic  kosher  gourmet  organic and natural foods  health and beauty care items and other non food items 
we believe that the acquisition of dhi and millbrook accomplishes several of our strategic objectives  including accelerating our expansion into a number of high growth business segments and establishing immediate market share in the fast growing specialty foods market 
we believe that millbrook s customer base enhances our conventional supermarket business channel and that the organizations complementary product lines present opportunities for cross selling 
in order to maintain our market leadership and improve our operating efficiencies  we seek to continually expand our marketing and customer service programs across regions  expand our national purchasing opportunities  offer a broader product selection  consolidate systems applications among physical locations and regions  increase our investment in people  facilities  equipment and technology  integrate administrative and accounting functions  and reduce geographic overlap between regions 

table of contents our continued growth has created the need for expansion of existing facilities to achieve maximum operating efficiencies and to assure adequate space for future needs 
we have made significant capital expenditures and incurred considerable expenses in connection with the opening and expansion of our facilities  and we expect to continue to do so 
in the past six years  we have invested over million in distribution capacity and infrastructure improvements 
we have increased our distribution capacity to approximately million square feet 
in august  we expanded our midwest operations by opening a  square foot distribution center in greenwood  indiana  which serves as a distribution hub for our customers in illinois  indiana  ohio and other midwest states 
in october  we opened our rocklin  california distribution center and moved our auburn  california operations to this facility 
the rocklin distribution center is  square feet in size and serves as a distribution hub for customers in california and surrounding states 
our new  square foot distribution center in ridgefield  washington commenced operations in december and serves as a regional distribution hub for customers in portland  oregon and other northwest markets 
we opened our sarasota  florida warehouse in the first quarter of fiscal in order to reduce the geographic area served by our atlanta  georgia facility  which we believe will contribute to lower transportation costs 
our new   square foot distribution center in moreno valley  california commenced operations in september and serves our customers in southern california  arizona  southern nevada  southern utah  and hawaii 
finally  in april  we announced plans to lease a new  square foot distribution center in york  pennsylvania to serve our customers in new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  delaware  maryland  ohio  virginia and west virginia 
operations are scheduled to commence in january our net sales consist primarily of sales of natural  organic and specialty products to retailers  adjusted for customer volume discounts  returns and allowances 
net sales also consist of amounts charged by us to customers for shipping and handling and fuel surcharges 
the principal components of our cost of sales include the amounts paid to manufacturers and growers for product sold  plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution facilities 
cost of sales also includes amounts incurred by us at our manufacturing subsidiary  hershey imports  for inbound transportation costs and depreciation for manufacturing equipment and consideration received from suppliers in connection with the purchase or promotion of the suppliers products 
our gross margin may not be comparable to other similar companies within our industry that may include all costs related to their distribution network in their costs of sales rather than as operating expenses 
we include purchasing and outbound transportation expenses within our operating expenses rather than in our cost of sales 
total operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits including payments under our employee stock ownership plan  warehousing and delivery  selling  occupancy  insurance  administrative  share based compensation  depreciation and amortization expense 
other expenses income include interest on our outstanding indebtedness  interest income and miscellaneous income and expenses 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies are i determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  ii determining our reserves for the self insured portions of our workers compensation and automobile liabilities and iii valuing goodwill and intangible assets 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we analyze customer creditworthiness  accounts receivable balances  payment history  payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer  future sales to the customer are conducted using either cash on delivery terms  or the account is closely monitored so that as agreed upon payments are received  orders are released  a failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of august  and july   respectively 
our notes receivable balances were million and million  net of the allowance of doubtful accounts of million and million  as of august  and july   respectively 
insurance reserves it is our policy to record the self insured portions of our workers compensation and automobile liabilities based upon actuarial methods of estimating the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled  and that have been incurred but not yet reported 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting litigation trends  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
if actual claims incurred are greater than those anticipated  our reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
accruals for workers compensation and automobile liabilities totaled million and million as of august  and july   respectively 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that companies test goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have elected to perform our annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year 
impairment losses are determined based upon the excess of carrying amounts over discounted expected future cash flows of the underlying business 
for reporting units that indicate potential impairment  we determine the implied fair value of that reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis and compare such values to the respective reporting units carrying amounts 
as of august   our annual assessment of each of our reporting units indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed 
total goodwill as of august  and july  was million and million  respectively 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired 
impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
there was no impairment to our indefinite lived intangible assets during total indefinite lived intangible assets as of august  and july  were million and million  respectively 
intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset s useful life based on updated projections 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow model 
there were no indicators of impairment during total finite lived intangible assets as of august  and july  were million and million  respectively 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended august  july  july  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses impairment on assets held for sale total operating expenses operating income other expense income interest expense interest income other  net total other expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income total reflects rounding note our fiscal year included weeks of operations while our and fiscal years included weeks of operations 
year ended august  compared to year ended july  net sales our net sales increased approximately  or million  to billion for the year ended august   from billion for the year ended july  this increase was primarily due to sales from our newly acquired unfi specialty distribution business of million as well as organic growth sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions in our wholesale distribution division of million  or 
further  approximately of the increase in net sales was attributable to the extra week included in fiscal our organic growth is due to the continued growth of the natural products industry in general  increased market share as a result of our focus on service and added value services  and the opening of new  and expansion of existing  distribution centers  which allow us to carry a broader selection of products 
in addition to net sales growth attributable to unfi specialty distribution and our organic growth  we also benefited from the inclusion of sales of products we acquired from organic brands  llc organic brands and acquisitions of and other branded product lines during fiscal and fiscal however  these acquisitions impacted our cost of sales and gross profit more than they impacted our net sales 
on a combined basis  and excluding sales to henry s and sun harvest store locations  which were divested by whole foods market following its merger with wild oats markets  whole foods market and wild oats markets accounted for approximately and of our net sales for the years 
table of contents ended august  and july   respectively 
the henry s and sun harvest locations divested by whole foods market remain our customers 
the following table lists the percentage of sales by customer type for the years ended august  and july  percentage of net sales customer type independently owned natural products retailers supernatural chains conventional supermarkets other sales to henry s and sun harvest store locations have been reclassified from our supernatural channel into our supermarket channel in both fiscal years and and will continue in this classification going forward 
this reclassification resulted in an increase in sales in the supermarket channel of and a decrease in sales in the supernatural channel of for the year ended july  in addition  sales by channel have been adjusted to reflect changes in customer types resulting from a review of our customer lists 
as a result of this adjustment  sales to the independents sales channel increased for the year ended july  and sales to the supermarket sales channel decreased for the year ended july  the overall decrease in sales to the independents and supernatural channels and the increase in sales to the supermarket channel was primarily due to the acquisition of millbrook in november  as our specialty distribution division primarily distributes to the supermarket channel 
gross profit our gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended august   from million for the year ended july  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended august  and for the year ended july  gross profit as a percentage of net sales during the year ended august  was positively impacted by sales from the unfi specialty distribution business and sales of our branded product lines 
we worked to take advantage of forward buying opportunities during the year ended august  in order to improve unfi specialty distribution s gross margin 
we expect unfi specialty distribution s full service supermarket model  to generate a higher gross margin over the long term in our core distribution business  however  we also expect to incur higher operating expenses in providing those services 
under this model  we provide services typically performed by supermarket employees to our customers  such as stocking shelves  placing sales orders and rotating out damaged and expired products 
we continue to focus on increasing our branded product revenues  which we believe will allow us to generate higher gross margins over the long term  as branded product revenues generally yield higher margins 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales during the year ended july  was negatively impacted by missed forward buying opportunities  the full year effect of new customer agreements  million of spoilage issues related to certain inventory of albert s  and million of incremental inventory adjustments in our broadline distribution business  partially offset by increases in rates within our fuel surcharge program  which passes to our customers the increased fuel costs associated with distributing our products to customers 
operating expenses our total operating expenses increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended august   from million for the year ended july  the increase 
table of contents in total operating expenses for the year ended august  was primarily due to increases in infrastructure  fuel and other distribution expenses in our wholesale division to support our sales growth of approximately million and a million increase in operating expenses as a result of the millbrook acquisition 
we have been able to partially offset the effect of rising fuel prices by increasing delivery sizes  improving route design and by opening new facilities which reduce the total distance traveled to customers 
we also incurred higher operating expenses during the year ended august  related to our branded product lines  as we have built our infrastructure to support anticipated new business  and million in labor and start up expenses related to our new distribution facilities in sarasota  florida  ridgefield  washington  moreno valley  california and york  pennsylvania 
total operating expenses for the year ended july  included a loss of million related to the sale of one of our auburn  california facilities  million of incremental and redundant costs incurred in connection with the start up of our sarasota  florida facility  million of costs to transition our expanded relationship with whole foods market in the southern pacific region of the united states to our facility located in fontana  california  an impairment charge of million related to the reclassification of the remaining auburn  california facility to held for sale and million of increased expense related to our fuel hedging program 
the last of our fuel hedges expired in june and we have not entered into any fuel hedges in fiscal total operating expenses for fiscal includes share based compensation expense of million  compared to million in fiscal see note stock option plans to our consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k 
as a percentage of net sales  total operating expenses increased to approximately for the year ended august   from approximately for the year ended july  the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to our acquisition of millbrook  which has higher operating expenses due to the additional in store services provided to supermarket customers  million in labor and start up expenses related to our new distribution facilities in sarasota  florida  ridgefield  washington  moreno valley  california and york  pennsylvania as well as operating inefficiencies related to the recent opening of the sarasota  florida and ridgefield  washington facilities  and our investment in infrastructure for our branded product lines 
we expect that the opening of new facilities will contribute efficiencies and lead to lower operating expenses related to sales over the long term 
as noted above  however  we expect to continue to incur operating expenses higher than we historically have experienced as a result of unfi specialty distribution s full service supermarket model 
operating income operating income decreased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended august   from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating income was for the year ended august  compared to for the year ended july  other expense income other expense income increased million to million for the year ended august   from million for the year ended july  interest expense for the year ended august  increased to million from million in the year ended july  the increase in interest expense was due primarily to the increase in debt levels required to fund our acquisitions of dhi and millbrook and three branded product companies 
debt levels also increased for the year ended august  compared to the year ended july  as a result of unfi specialty distribution s working capital needs and increased inventory levels in preparation for the opening of the sarasota  
table of contents florida and ridgefield  washington facilities in the first and second quarters of fiscal  respectively  and capital expenditures related to the future opening of our moreno valley  california and york  pennsylvania facilities 
interest income for the year ended august  decreased to million from million in the year ended july  provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended august  and july   respectively 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate for the year ended august  was primarily due to anticipated tax credits associated with the solar panel installation projects at our rocklin  california and dayville  connecticut distribution facilities 
this decrease was offset by an increase in our effective income tax rate due to the acquisition of dhi and millbrook 
our effective income tax rate was also affected by share based compensation for incentive stock options and the timing of disqualifying dispositions of certain share based compensation awards 
certain incentive stock option expenses are not deductible for tax purposes until a disqualifying disposition occurs 
a disqualifying disposition occurs when the option holder sells shares within one year of exercising an incentive stock option 
we receive a tax benefit in the period that the disqualifying disposition occurs 
our effective income tax rate will continue to be effected by the tax impact related to incentive stock options and the timing of tax benefits related to disqualifying dispositions 
in fiscal we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of to 
net income net income decreased million to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended august   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales our net sales increased approximately  or million  to billion for the year ended july   from billion for the year ended july  this increase was primarily due to organic growth growth excluding the impact of acquisitions in our wholesale distribution division of million or 
our organic growth is due to the continued growth of the natural products industry in general  increased market share as a result of our focus on service and added value services  the opening of new  and expansion of existing  distribution centers  which allow us to carry a broader selection of products  and approximately sales growth as a result of our expanded relationship with whole foods market in the southern pacific region of the united states 
in addition to our organic growth  we also benefited from the inclusion of sales related to our acquisition of certain assets of organic brands in april and our acquisitions of other branded product lines  however  these acquisitions impacted our cost of sales and gross profit more than they impacted our net sales 
in the years ended july  and july   sales to whole foods market and wild oats markets were approximately and of net sales  respectively

this reclassification resulted in an increase in sales in the supermarket channel and a decrease in sales in the supernatural channel of for each of the years ended july  and july  in addition  sales by channel have been adjusted to reflect changes in customer types resulting from a review of our customer lists 
as a result of this adjustment  sales to the independents sales channel increased and sales to the supermarket sales channel decreased and for the years ended july  and july   respectively 
gross profit our gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended july  and for the year ended july  the decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven by missed forward buying opportunities of approximately million due to our focus on our expanded whole foods market relationship in the southern pacific region of the united states  which we commenced in january  the full year effect of new customer agreements  million of spoilage issues related to certain inventory at our albert s organics division  and million of incremental inventory adjustments within our broadline distribution business  partially offset by increases in rates within our fuel surcharge program  which passes to our customers the increased fuel costs associated with distributing our products to customers

total operating expenses for the year ended july  included million of expenses incurred in connection with the employment transition agreement entered into during the first quarter of fiscal with our former president and chief executive officer  not including the effect of share based compensation discussed below  and million of incremental and redundant costs incurred in connection with the transition from our former warehouses and outside storage facility in auburn  california into our new facility in rocklin  california

as a percentage of net sales  total operating expenses decreased to approximately for the year ended july   from approximately for the year ended july  the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to further leveraging our fixed operating costs due to our increased sales  improved operations in our select nutrition division and increased efficiencies due to our recent distribution facility openings  offset by operating losses related to the albert s organics greenwood  indiana location which operations were transferred to the albert s organics minneapolis  minnesota facility effective october  
we expect these efficiencies to continue to lower operating expenses relative to sales over the long term

interest income for the year ended july  increased to million from million in the year ended july  the increase in interest income was due to higher average cash levels during the year ended july  than during the year ended july  provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended july  and july   respectively 
this increase in the effective tax rate relates to our utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards during fiscal as well as share based compensation for incentive stock options  because certain incentive stock option expenses are not deductible for tax purposes until a disqualifying disposition occurs 
a disqualifying disposition occurs when the option holder sells shares within one year of exercising an incentive stock option 
we receive a tax benefit in the period that the disqualifying disposition occurs 
our effective income tax rate will continue to be affected by the tax impact related to incentive stock options and the timing of tax benefits related to disqualifying dispositions 
net income net income increased million to million  or per diluted share for the year ended july   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  operating leases  trade payables and bank indebtedness 
from time to time  
table of contents depending on our capital needs and market conditions  we may also sell equity and debt securities to finance our operations and growth 
on april   we entered into an amended and restated four year million revolving credit facility secured by  among other things  our accounts receivable  inventory and general intangibles  with a bank group that was led by bank of america business capital as the administrative agent 
the credit facility replaced an existing million revolving credit facility 
the terms and conditions of our amended and restated credit facility provide us with more financial and operational flexibility  reduced costs and increased liquidity than did our prior credit facility 
we amended this facility effective as of january   reducing the rate at which interest accrues on libor borrowings from one month libor plus to one month libor plus 
on november   we amended our million revolving credit facility to temporarily increase the maximum borrowing base under the credit facility from million to million 
we used the funds available to us as a result of this amendment to fund a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of dhi and millbrook 
on november   we amended our million revolving credit facility to increase the maximum borrowing base under the credit facility from million to million 
this amendment also provides the company with a one time option  subject to approval by the lenders under the credit facility  to increase the borrowing base by up to an additional million 
interest accrues on borrowings under the credit facility  at our option  at either the base rate the applicable prime lending rate of bank of america business capital  as announced from time to time or at one month libor plus 
the million credit facility matures on november  the revolving credit facility supports our working capital requirements in the ordinary course of business and provides capital to grow our business organically or through acquisitions 
as of august   our borrowing base  based on accounts receivable and inventory levels  was million  with remaining availability of million 
in april  we executed a term loan agreement in the principal amount of million secured by the real property that was released from the lien under our former million revolving credit facility in accordance with an amendment to the loan and security agreement related to that facility 
the million term loan is repayable over seven years based on a fifteen year amortization schedule 
interest on the term loan accrued at one month libor plus 
in december  we amended this term loan agreement by increasing the principal amount from million to million under the existing terms and conditions 
on july   we entered into an amended term loan agreement which further increased the principal amount of this term loan from million to up to million and decreased the rate at which interest accrues to one month libor plus 
in connection with the amendments to our revolving credit facility described above  effective november  and november   we amended the term loan agreement to conform certain terms and conditions to the corresponding terms and conditions under our revolving credit facility 
as of august   million was outstanding under the term loan agreement 
on june   we further amended our revolving credit facility and our term loan agreement  effective as of may   in order to i waive events of default as a result of our noncompliance at april  with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenants under the revolving credit facility and our term loan agreement the fixed charge coverage ratio covenants  ii increase the interest rate applicable to borrowings under each of our revolving credit facility and our term loan by during the period from june  through the date on which we demonstrate compliance with the applicable fixed charge coverage ratio covenant  and iii exclude non cash share based compensation expense from the calculation of ebitda as defined in the applicable agreement in connection with the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio under the revolving credit facility and the term loan agreement 
the revolving credit facility and our term loan agreement  as amended  
table of contents require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to and to  respectively  each calculated at the end of each of our fiscal quarters on a rolling four quarter basis 
the principal reason for our noncompliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenants was the high level of capital expenditures we made in the trailing twelve month period ended april  we were in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenants as of the close of our fourth quarter of fiscal  and expect to be able to demonstrate this compliance in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit facility and the term loan agreement 
we believe that our capital requirements for fiscal will be between and million 
we will finance these requirements with cash generated from operations and the use of our existing credit facilities 
our planned capital projects will provide both expanded facilities and technology that we believe will provide us with the capacity to continue to support the growth and expansion of our business 
we believe that our future capital requirements will be lower than our anticipated fiscal requirements  as a percentage of net sales  although we plan to continue to invest in technology and expand our facilities 
future investments and acquisitions will be financed through either equity or long term debt negotiated at the time of the potential acquisition 
net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended august   a decrease of million from million in the year ended july  the primary reasons for the decrease in cash flows from operations were a decrease in net income for the year ended august  compared to the year ended july   an increase in inventories and a decrease in accounts payable 
these cash outflows were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses 
the increase in inventory levels primarily relates to increased sales  restoring unfi specialty distribution s inventory levels by taking advantage of forward buying opportunities to improve unfi specialty distribution s gross profit and building inventory for the opening of our sarasota  florida  ridgefield  washington and moreno valley  california facilities in september  december and september  respectively 
net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended july   as the result of net income of million  the change in cash collected from customers net of cash paid to vendors and a million investment in inventory 
days in inventory was days at august  and days at july  this increase was due primarily to inventory purchased in anticipation of the opening of our sarasota  florida  ridgefield  washington and moreno valley  california distribution facilities while we worked to reduce inventory levels at the atlanta  georgia and auburn  washington facilities 
days sales outstanding improved to days at august   compared to days at july  working capital decreased by million  or  to million at august   compared to working capital of million at july  net cash used in investing activities increased million to million for the year ended august   compared to million for the year ended july  this increase was primarily due to purchases of acquired businesses  net of cash 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended august   primarily due to proceeds from borrowings under notes payable related to our acquisition of dhi and millbrook  partially offset by repayments on long term debt 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended july   primarily due to million in proceeds received from the increase in borrowings under our term loan agreement  the increase in our bank overdraft and proceeds from  and the tax benefit due to  the exercise of stock options  partially offset by repayments of long term debt and notes payable 
on december   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
as part of the stock repurchase program  we purchased  shares of our common stock for our treasury during the year ended july  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
all shares were purchased at prevailing market prices 
no such purchases were made during the years ended august  
table of contents or july  we may continue or  from time to time  suspend repurchases of shares under our stock repurchase program  depending on prevailing market conditions  alternate uses of capital and other factors 
whether and when to initiate and or complete any purchase of common stock and the amount of common stock purchased will be determined in our complete discretion 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective july  this interest rate swap agreement has an initial notional amount of million and provides for us to pay interest at a fixed rate of while receiving interest for the same period at one month libor on the same notional principal amount 
the interest rate swap agreement has a seven year term with an amortizing notional amount which adjusts down on the dates payment are due on the underlying term loan 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor movements on current variable rate indebtedness totaling million at one month libor plus  thereby fixing our effective rate on the notional amount at

 business combinations 
sfas r continues to require the purchase method of accounting for business combinations and the identification and recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas r requires  among other things  the buyer to fair value assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date ie  a fair value model rather than a cost allocation model  expense acquisition related costs  recognize assets or liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies at the acquisition date using acquisition date fair values  recognize goodwill as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest over the acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired  recognize at acquisition any contingent consideration using acquisition date fair values ie  fair value earn outs in the initial accounting for the acquisition  and eliminate the recognition of liabilities for restructuring costs expected to be incurred as a result of the business combination 
sfas r also defines a bargain purchase as a business combination where the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest 
under this circumstance  the buyer is required to recognize such excess formerly referred to as negative goodwill in earnings as a gain 
in addition  if the buyer determines that some or all of its previously booked deferred tax valuation allowance is no longer needed as a result of the business combination  sfas r requires that the reduction or elimination of the valuation allowance be accounted as a reduction of income tax expense 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the company will apply sfas r to any acquisitions that are made on or after august  in december  the fasb issued sfas no

tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods

as more fully described in note financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k  we use interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations 
at august   we were a party to one interest rate swap agreement  which relates to our million term loan agreement and which we entered into during august the swap 
we account for the swap using hedge accounting treatment because the derivative has been determined to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged items 
the swap requires us to pay interest for a seven year period at a fixed rate of on an amortizing notional principal amount of million  while receiving interest for the same period at one month libor on the same amortizing notional principal amount 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor movements on current variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing our effective rate on the notional amount at 
under this method of accounting  at august   we recorded a liability of million representing the fair value of the swap 
we do not enter into derivative agreements for trading purposes 
at august   we had long term floating rate debt of million and long term fixed rate debt of million  representing and  respectively  of our long term debt 
at july   we had long term floating rate debt of million and long term fixed rate debt of million  representing and  respectively  of our long term debt 
holding other swap terms and debt levels constant  a basis point change in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately  and  at august  and july   respectively
