item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of any of the customers of the company were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as noted in note g to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  the company has accrued  in environmental remediation costs which  in management s best estimate  are expected to satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements as outlined in note g 
however  as a result of the evolving nature of the environmental regulations  the difficulty in estimating the extent and necessary remediation of environmental contamination  and the availability and application of technology  the estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainties and it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of future costs of environmental matters which may subsequently be determined 
changes in information known to management or in applicable regulations may require the company to record additional remediation reserves 
the company continually reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets 
the company also reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
when the future undiscounted cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the asset  the assets are written down to fair value 
based on assessments performed in on the assets of the company  no write downs were deemed necessary 
the company believes that it is unlikely that these types of impairment charges will occur with respect to its existing assets 
however  if business conditions at any of the plant sites were to deteriorate to an extent where cash flows and other impairment measurements indicated values for the related long lived assets were less than the carrying values of those assets  impairment charges could be necessary 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operations during totaled  this compares to cash flows used in operations during of  or an increase in cash flows of  from to the company s inventories increased  from year end to year end compared to increasing  from year end to year end 
almost all of the increases in both years occurred in the metals segment primarily as a result of the significant increase in cost from stainless steel surcharges discussed below  coupled with an increase in special alloy and larger diameter pipe requirements to meet customer orders and the increase in piping systems backlog 
the increases in inventory were offset somewhat by the metals segment receiving advance payments from customers   in accrued expense at year end and  at year end  used to purchase stainless steel raw materials specific to their orders 
accounts receivable declined  in after increasing  in the decrease in reflects the four percent decline in sales experienced in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period last year  and the increase in resulted primarily from the improvement in sales experienced in  up percent over the prior year amount 
accounts payable increased  in and  in both increases resulted primarily from increases in the costs of raw materials discussed above combined with the timing of the receipt of and payment for stainless steel raw materials by the metals segment at each year end 
cash flows were positively impacted in by net income from continuing operations of  before depreciation and amortization expense of  compared to  generated from net income before depreciation and amortization expense in the net effect of the items described above was to increase current assets by  and current liabilities by  which also caused working capital for to increase by  to  from the amount in the current ratio for the year ended december   decreased to from the year end ratio of the company utilized its line of credit facility to fund its working capital needs and fund capital expenditures of  as a result of the significant increase in cash flows generated in  the company was able to reduce borrowings by  in the company expects that cash flows from operations and available borrowings will be sufficient to make debt payments  fund estimated capital expenditures of  and normal operating requirements  and pay a dividend of 
per share on march  for a cash payment of  on december   the company entered into a credit agreement with a lender to provide a  line of credit that expires on december   refinancing the company s existing bank indebtedness 
the agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of  which includes a  sub limit for swing line loans that requires additional pre approval by the bank  and a five year  term loan requiring equal quarterly payments of  with a balloon payment at the expiration date 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit are limited to an amount equal to a borrowing base calculation that includes eligible accounts receivable  inventories  and cash surrender value of the company s life insurance as defined in the agreement 
as of december   the amount available for borrowing was  of which  was borrowed  leaving  of availability 
borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
at december   the company was in compliance with its debt covenants which include  among others  maintaining certain ebitda  fixed charge and tangible net worth ratios and amounts

consolidated operating results for were impacted by the completion of the relocation of organic pigments operations from greensboro  nc to spartanburg in the first quarter of a  loss was recorded for the move in the first quarter of the greensboro plant was sold in august of for a sales price of  and a pre tax gain of  was recorded in the third quarter of consolidated operating results for were significantly impacted by several transactions that were recorded during the fourth quarter of in december of  the company  along with several other domestic stainless steel pipe producers  received funds from the settlement of an anti dumping duty order against a foreign producer and importer of stainless steel pipe issued under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act 
the order covered the period from june  to november  as a result the company recorded a gain of  the company s op subsidiary had an  note receivable from an affiliated company in which op owns percent 
the affiliated company has as its primary asset a minority investment in a chinese pigment plant under a joint venture agreement that expires in from which op purchases some of its raw materials 
the joint venture had been profitable since  but reported an operating loss for and indicated that market and operating conditions were not expected to improve and anticipated incurring losses going forward 
based on the current and anticipated operating losses of the joint venture and other factors the company was able to ascertain  the likelihood that the affiliated company would be able to repay the note receivable became unlikely 
the receivable was written off at december  and the  loss was included in other expense

amount in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense operating income year end backlogs piping systems comparison of to metals segment the metals segment achieved sales growth of percent for the year from a percent increase in average selling prices  partially offset by a percent decline in unit volumes 
operating income of  was percent higher than s total of  the large increases in average selling prices resulted partly from higher stainless steel surcharges  primarily in the first three quarters  compared to more significant to the long term future of the company is the contribution to increased selling prices resulting from accomplishing our goal of expanding into markets that require larger pipe sizes  higher priced alloys  larger proportions of non commodity products  and products fabricated by our piping sysstems plant 
the change in product mix includes the successful development of business from liquid natural gas lng  wastewater and water treatment  biofuels and electric utility scrubber projects 
many of the products produced for these markets are subject to more stringent specifications including percent x ray of the weld seams 
in addition  some of these non commodity products are made from expensive alloys and are more difficult to produce 
accordingly  their cost and sales price are much higher than commodity products 
the decline in unit volume for as compared to resulted from a percent decline in pipe sales  partially offset by a percent increase in piping systems 
the noteworthy increase in gross profit was more than accounted for by a surge in our piping systems products to more than triple amounts earned in  while pipe sales yielded slightly lower profits 
gross profits are impacted from stainless steel surcharges which are assessed each month by the stainless steel producers to cover the change in their costs of certain raw materials 
the company  in turn  passes on the surcharge in the sales prices charged to its customers 
under the company s first in first out inventory method  cost of goods sold is charged for the surcharges that were in effect three or more months prior to the month of sale 
accordingly  if surcharges are in an upward trend  reported profits will benefit 
conversely  when surcharges go down  profits are reduced 
during the first six months of  the company continued to experience the upward trend in surcharges experienced in the third and fourth quarters of as a result  surcharges were significantly higher than they were in the first six months of with an accompanying benefit to gross profits 
over the last six months of  surcharges declined reducing gross profits 
sales for the fourth quarter of declined percent from a percent decline in unit volumes partially offset by a percent increase in average selling prices while operating income declined percent to  for the fourth quarter of compared to  in the fourth quarter of the decrease in unit volume experienced in the fourth quarter of resulted from a percent decline in commodity pipe sales  partially offset by percent higher piping systems unit volumes compared to the fourth quarter of weak market conditions that began in the third quarter of deteriorated further in the fourth quarter causing the big unit volume decrease in pipe sales 
stainless steel surcharges declined significantly in august  september and october  and although nickel prices rose in november and december  they flattened in january and fell in february this uncertainty of nickel pricing along with distributors desire to reduce inventories at year end caused distributors to limit purchases throughout the fourth quarter 
another factor causing the volume declines for the year and fourth quarter of when compared to the same periods of was the significant increase in imports  primarily from china 
finally  the weakening of end use demand for commodity pipe experienced toward the end of the third quarter accelerated in the fourth quarter 
although our non commodity business in the fourth quarter of was strong  it was not enough to offset the negative impact on profitability from the lower than expected commodity pipe sales which generated substantial under absorption of fixed and overhead costs 
piping systems continued to experience the favorable impact of its strong backlog as operating income increased significantly in the fourth quarter of compared to a year earlier 
piping systems backlog was  at the end of compared to  at the end selling and administrative expense increased  or percent in when compared to  but remained unchanged at four percent of sales in consistent with the dollar increase came primarily from increased management incentives  which are based on profits  and sales commissions  coming from the increase in sales in compared to  from amounts expensed in comparison of to metals segment the metals segment produced strong sales growth of percent for the year and percent for the fourth quarter of compared to the same periods of the increase for the year resulted from a combination of percent higher unit volumes and a two percent increase in average selling prices 
the increase for the quarter resulted from a percent increase in average selling prices partially offset by a two percent decline in unit volumes 
the segment achieved a surge in gross profits of percent for and percent in the fourth quarter compared to the same periods of the increase in unit volumes for the year resulted partly from an increase in commodity pipe sales resulting from recapturing market share beginning in the last quarter of however  the largest portion of the increase was from much higher production of piping systems for energy and water treatment customers 
the slight decline in fourth quarter unit volumes as compared with fourth quarter resulted from an unusually high level of commodity pipe sales in the fourth quarter of that resulted from the aggressive program to recapture market share mentioned above 
the modest increase in selling prices for the year resulted from a more robust increase in prices mostly offset by the change in product mix 
the significant increase in fourth quarter selling prices reflects the higher costs of stainless steel  including surcharges  in the fourth quarter of compared to s fourth quarter  coupled with a change in product mix 
during the third and fourth quarters of  stainless steel surcharges were significantly higher than they were in the first six months with an accompanying significant benefit to profits 
the fourth quarter of also benefited from surcharges  but to a much lesser extent than the significant increase in gross profits for resulted from a much improved operating level in piping systems plus the good unit volume increase in pipe sales  partially offset by a lower surcharge benefit 
the significant increase in gross profit for the fourth quarter came from the increase in selling prices and the significant benefit from rising surcharges 
the improvement in sales and operating income reflects management s successful efforts to penetrate new markets for piping systems as well as pipe sales 
the energy industry  including lng and ethanol projects  together with wastewater treatment provided a small percentage of the segment s sales prior to although the segment has benefited from regaining market share in commodity pipe  these new sources generated much of the improvement in results 
with these new industry segments comprising about percent of the piping systems backlog  management believes that it has differentiated the segment from its domestic competitors by having unique manufacturing capabilities that give the segment a competitive advantage in pursuing non commodity pipe sales as well as piping systems projects 
selling and administrative expense increased only  or 
percent in when compared to  and as a result declined to four percent of sales in compared to five percent of sales in as a result of all of the factors listed above  the segment experienced significant sales and profit improvement for the year compared to  with operating income increasing percent for the year and percent in the fourth quarter of compared to the same periods last year

amount in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense operating income comparison of to specialty chemicals segment the specialty chemicals segment sales increased six percent for the year and percent in the fourth quarter of compared to the same periods of the increase in revenues in came primarily from adding several new products during the year  an increase in demand for our contract manufacturing products  and increased selling prices on our basic chemical products to pass on higher energy related costs 
our basic chemical and contract manufacturing businesses continued to benefit from favorable market conditions experienced throughout the year 
as a result  gross profits for the year increased two percent to  compared to  for although sales increased in the fourth quarter of compared to  gross profit as a percent of sales declined two percent to percent  or  compared to percent  or  generated in sales and gross profits were negatively impacted for the year and fourth quarter of by lower results in our pigment business resulting from increased raw material costs we were unable to pass on  coupled with a slowdown in business throughout the pigment product lines 
selling and administrative expense increased  or less than one percent in compared to  and remained unchanged at eight percent of sales in consistent with as a result of the factors discussed above  operating income for the year increased five percent to  compared to  for  and declined percent to  for the fourth quarter of compared to  for the fourth quarter of comparison of to specialty chemicals segment the specialty chemicals segment sales increased nine percent for the year ended and gross profit increased percent to  compared to  for  and increased to percent of sales for the year compared to percent for a modest sales decline of three percent in the fourth quarter of was overshadowed by a percent increase in gross profits to  for the quarter compared to  for the same period of the increase in revenues for the year resulted primarily from adding several new products during the first three quarters of  a significant increase in demand for one of our contract manufacturing products  and increased selling prices to pass on higher energy related costs 
the minor decline in fourth quarter revenues resulted from the normal fluctuation in demand from quarter to quarter 
the segment completed the relocation of its pigment operations from greensboro  nc to spartanburg  sc at the end of the first quarter of and benefited from the improved efficiency resulting from the consolidation of the two operations throughout the rest of the year 
the combination of the cost savings from the relocation and increase in revenues produced the profit improvement for the year 
the significant improvement in profit experienced in the fourth quarter resulted from the cost savings in and the impact on the fourth quarter of earnings at the spartanburg plant related to costs of developing new products and upgrading of the staff in expectation of higher production levels in selling and administrative expense increased  or four percent in compared to  but declined as a percent of sales to eight percent in compared to nine percent in the dollar increase resulted primarily from profit based incentives 
as a result of the factors discussed above  operating income increased percent to  compared to  for in the fourth quarter of operating income increased percent to  for the quarter compared to  for the same period of discontinued operations on march   the company entered into an agreement to sell its liquid dye business comprised of vat  sulfur  liquid disperse and liquid reactive dyes  which had annual sales of approximately  for approximately its net book value  and several customers and related products of the remaining textile dye business were rationalized 
business conditions in the remaining dye business were poor throughout  especially in the first six months  as bu colors a newly formed subsidiary of the company called blackman uhler  llc experienced operating losses in every quarter of in the third quarter of  the company decided to attempt to sell the remaining dye business and on december   entered into a purchase agreement to sell the dye business 
the transaction closed on january  the terms included the sale of the inventory of bu colors along with certain equipment and other property associated with the business being sold  and the licensing of certain intellectual property  for a purchase price of approximately  of which  was paid at closing  and the balance of  was to be paid over time based on the operations of the purchaser 
on january   the company and the purchaser amended the purchase agreement replacing the periodic purchase price payments with a one time payment of  which was received on january   and was reclassified to a current note receivable in the financial statements at december  as a result of the sale of the dye business in  the company has discontinued the operations of bu colors and has presented the financial information of bu colors as discontinued operations 
in december of  the company completed an impairment assessment in accordance with fas no

current conditions and outlook the specialty chemicals segment ended with increased revenues and profits over the preceding year for the fourth consecutive year reflecting management s efforts to generate new products  improve existing products  and compete in markets not as susceptible to foreign imports 
market conditions continue to be favorable  and the segment continues to experience positive results from new products developed in although disappointed with the pigment operation s results in the fourth quarter  steps are being taken to bring this operation s profits back in line with the remainder of the segment s operations 
management continues to believe that we have an effective and low cost fire retardant product line and with the price of inherent fire retardant fibers escalating  chemical solutions should become more attractive 
however  revenues continue to grow at a slower rate than originally expected 
all of these factors provide the opportunity for the segment to continue to improve profitability going into the extremely depressed unit volume sales of commodity pipe experienced in the last half of has continued into early we believe these low volumes are primarily the result of a surge in pipe imported from china rather than any loss of market share to other domestic producers 
management believes china is exporting pipe from excess capacity at dumped and subsidized prices into the us market 
as a result of the significant increases in stainless steel pipe imported from china  the metals segment along with three other us producers of stainless steel pipe and the united steelworkers union filed an unfair trade case against china on january  it is the third case involving pipe and tube imports from china filed in the past six months 
so far  preliminary department of commerce findings have supported petitioners in the previous cases  although the us international trade commission itc has yet to weigh in with final injury determinations 
the itc is expected to make preliminary injury determinations within days 
the department of commerce is expected to make its preliminary subsidy and dumping determinations within to days 
we are hopeful that this action will reduce unfair imports which should lead to more normalized unit volume sales probably beginning in the second quarter 
prices  including surcharges  of stainless steels from which we make commodity pipe are significantly lower than the highs reached in the third quarter of this has led to our inventory costs being higher than current replacement value 
to meet competition  we are currently pricing sales based on current rather than historical costs  which will negatively impact our commodity pipe profits until the higher priced inventory is sold 
unless conditions change  this is likely to depress profits from commodity pipe into the second quarter of the volatility in stainless steel prices  together with any effects from the outcome of the trade case discussed above  make the short term performance of commodity pipe more uncertain than usual 
management believes that the growth generated by our non commodity pipe business in  including our significant piping systems business  should continue in piping systems  backlog at year end  of which management expects about percent to be completed over the next months  should continue to provide a higher level of non commodity sales and profits for as compared to management continues to be optimistic about the piping systems business due to a continuing demand for projects we believe will bid during future months 
with over percent of the backlog coming from energy and water and wastewater treatment projects  management continues to believe that it has positioned the metals segment to benefit from the long term growth of these areas 
all of the factors discussed above generate uncertainty for the overall performance of our metals business for the first and to a lesser extent the second quarter of however  we believe that the growth of our non commodity business  coupled with an anticipated improvement in the commodity pipe business that we believe should begin during the second quarter  should generate improved results over the balance of item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risks from adverse changes in interest rates 
in this regard  changes in u 
s 
interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents as well as interest paid on its indebtedness 
except as described below  the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
fair value of the company s debt obligations  which approximated the recorded value  consisted of at december   under a  line of credit and term loan agreement expiring december  with a variable interest rate of percent 
at december   under a  line of credit and term loan agreement expiring december  with a variable interest rate of percent 
the company periodically utilizes derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related pronouncements 
cash flow and fair value hedges are hedges that are intended to eliminate the risk of changes in the fair values of assets  liabilities and certain types of firm commitments 
the company s objective in using these instruments is to help protect its earnings and cash flows from interest rate risks on its long term indebtedness and fluctuations in the fair value of commodities used in the company s stainless steel raw materials 
the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions 
in this documentation  the company specifically identifies the asset  liability and non cancelable commitment that has been designated as a hedged item and states how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to that item 
the company formally measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis 
the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item  when the derivative expires  when it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur  when a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or when management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
cash flow hedges are hedges that use simple derivatives to offset the variability of expected future cash flows 
variability can appear in floating rate liabilities and can arise from changes in interest rates 
the company uses an interest rate swap in which it pays a fixed rate of interest while receiving a variable rate of interest to change the cash flow profile of its variable rate borrowing to match a fixed rate profile 
as discussed in note e to the consolidated financial statements  the company entered into a long term debt agreement with its bank and pays interest based on a variable interest rate 
to mitigate the variability of the interest rate risk  the company entered into a derivative swap contract in february of with the bank  coupled with a third party who will pay a variable rate of interest an interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap is for  with a fixed interest rate of percent  and runs from march  to december   which equates to the final payment amount and due date of the term loan 
although the swap is expected to effectively offset variable interest in the borrowing  hedge accounting is not utilized 
therefore  changes in its fair value are being recorded in current assets or liabilities  as appropriate  with corresponding offsetting entries to interest expense 
in the ordinary course of business  the company s income and cash flows may be affected by fluctuations in the price of nickel  which is a component of stainless steel raw materials used in its production of stainless steel pipe 
the company is subject to raw material surcharges on the nickel component from its stainless steel suppliers 
for certain non cancelable fixed price sales contracts having delivery dates in the future  the company is not able to obtain fixed price purchase commitments to cover the nickel surcharge component of the stainless steel raw material requirements of the sales contract which creates a cost exposure from fluctuations in the nickel surcharges 
where such exposure exists  the company considers the use of cash settled commodity price swaps with durations approximately equal to the expected delivery dates of the applicable raw materials to hedge the price of its nickel requirements 
the company designates these instruments as fair value hedges and the resulting changes in their fair value are recorded as inventory costs 
subsequent gains and losses are recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
while these hedging activities may protect the company against higher nickel prices  they may also prevent realizing possible lower raw material costs in the event that the market price of nickel falls below the price stated in a forward sale or futures contract 
there were no outstanding hedging contracts on nickel commodities at december  or december
