item a 
risk factors 
discussed below are the more significant risk factors relating to spectra energy 
reductions in demand for natural gas and low market prices of commodities affect spectra energy s operations and cash flows 
declines in demand for natural gas as a result of economic downturns and conservation efforts in spectra energy s gas service territories may reduce overall gas deliveries and reduce spectra energy s cash flows  especially if its industrial customers reduce production and  therefore  consumption of gas 
spectra energy s gas gathering and processing businesses may experience a decline in the volume of natural gas gathered and processed at their plants  resulting in lower revenues and cash flows  as lower economic output reduces energy demand 
revenues and cash flows would also be affected by lower market prices of natural gas and ngls 
lower demand for natural gas and lower prices for natural gas and ngls result from multiple factors that affect the markets where spectra energy operates  including weather conditions  including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy usage for heating or cooling purposes  respectively  supply of and demand for energy commodities  including any decreases in the production of natural gas which could negatively affect spectra energy s processing business due to lower throughput  capacity and transmission service into  or out of  spectra energy s markets  and petrochemical demand for ngls 
the lack of availability of natural gas resources may cause customers to contract with alternative service providers  which could materially adversely affect spectra energy s revenues  earnings and cash flows 
spectra energy s natural gas businesses are dependent on the continued availability of natural gas production and reserves 
prices for natural gas  regulatory limitations  or a shift in supply sources could adversely affect development of additional reserves and production that is accessible by spectra energy s pipeline  gathering  processing and distribution assets 
lack of commercial quantities of natural gas available to these assets will cause customers to contract with alternative service suppliers  thereby reducing their reliance on spectra energy s services  which in turn would materially adversely affect spectra energy s revenues  earnings and cash flows 

table of contents 
index to financial statements investments and projects located in canada expose spectra energy to fluctuations in currency rates that may adversely affect results of operations and cash flows 
spectra energy is exposed to foreign currency risk from investments and operations in canada 
as of december   a devaluation in the currency exchange rate of the canadian dollar would result in an estimated loss on the translation of canadian currency earnings of million 
the consolidated balance sheet would be negatively affected by million currency translation through the cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income 
natural gas gathering and processing operations are subject to commodity price risk which could result in losses in earnings and reduced cash flows 
spectra energy has gathering and processing operations that consist of contracts to buy and sell commodities  including contracts for natural gas  ngls and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash 
spectra energy is primarily exposed to market price fluctuations of ngl prices in the field services segment and to frac spreads in the empress operations in canada 
since ngl prices historically track crude oil prices  spectra energy discloses its ngl price sensitivities in terms of crude oil price changes 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   at spectra energy s forecasted ngl to oil price relationships  a per barrel move in oil prices would affect spectra energy s annual pre tax earnings by approximately million in million from field services and million from us transmission 
with respect to the frac spread risk related to empress processing and ngl marketing activities in western canada  as of december   a change in the difference between the btu equivalent price of propane used as a proxy for empress ngl production and the price of natural gas in alberta  canada would affect spectra energy s pre tax earnings by approximately million on an annual basis in these hypothetical calculations consider estimated production levels  but do not consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in commodity prices 
the actual effect of commodity price changes on spectra energy s earnings could be significantly different than these estimates 
spectra energy s business is subject to extensive regulation that affects operations and costs 
spectra energy s us assets and operations are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities  including regulation by the ferc and by various authorities under federal  state and local environmental laws 
spectra energy s natural gas assets and operations in canada are also subject to regulation by federal  provincial and local authorities including the neb and the oeb and by various federal and provincial authorities under environmental laws 
regulation affects almost every aspect of spectra energy s business  including  among other things  the ability to determine terms and rates for services provided by some of its businesses  make acquisitions  construct  expand and operate facilities  issue equity or debt securities  and pay dividends 
in addition  regulators in both the us and canada have taken actions to strengthen market forces in the gas pipeline industry  which have led to increased competition 
in a number of key markets  natural gas pipeline and storage operators are facing competitive pressure from a number of new industry participants  such as alternative suppliers as well as traditional pipeline competitors 
increased competition driven by regulatory changes could have a material effect on spectra energy s business  earnings  financial condition and cash flows 
execution of spectra energy s capital projects subjects spectra energy to construction risks  increases in labor costs and materials  and other risks that may adversely affect financial results 
a significant portion of spectra energy s growth is accomplished through the construction of new pipelines and storage facilities as well as the expansion of existing facilities 
construction of these facilities is subject to various regulatory  development and operational risks  including the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits by regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms the availability of skilled labor  equipment  and materials to complete expansion projects  
table of contents 
index to financial statements potential changes in federal  state and local statutes and regulations  including environmental requirements  that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project  impediments on spectra energy s ability to acquire rights of way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms  and the ability to construct projects within anticipated costs  including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or increased costs of equipment  materials  labor  or other factors beyond spectra energy s control  that may be material 
any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding  delay its completion or increase its anticipated costs 
as a result  new facilities may not achieve expected investment return  which could adversely affect results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
transmission and storage  distribution  and gathering and processing activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise affect operations 
there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent in natural gas transmission and storage  distribution  and gathering and processing activities  such as leaks  explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial financial losses 
in addition  these risks could result in significant injury  loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution  and impairment of operations  any of which could result in substantial losses to spectra energy 
for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers  industrial sites and other public gathering areas  the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater 
spectra energy does not maintain insurance coverage against all of these risks and losses  and any insurance coverage it might maintain may not fully cover the damages caused by those risks and losses 
therefore  should any of these risks materialize  it could have a material adverse effect on spectra energy s business  earnings  financial condition and cash flows 
spectra energy is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations  compliance with which requires significant capital expenditures  can increase cost of operations  and may affect or limit business plans  or expose spectra energy to environmental liabilities 
spectra energy is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations  including air emissions  water quality  wastewater discharges  solid waste and hazardous waste 
these laws and regulations can result in increased capital  operating and other costs 
these laws and regulations generally require spectra energy to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses  permits  inspections and other approvals 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures  including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties  and failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines  penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets 
spectra energy may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for its operating assets or development projects 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals  if spectra energy fails to obtain or comply with them or if environmental laws or regulations change and become more stringent  the operation of facilities or the development of new facilities could be prevented  delayed or become subject to additional costs 
no assurance can be made that the costs that will be incurred to comply with environmental regulations in the future will not have a material effect 
canada is a signatory to and has ratified the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change 
in  the province of alberta adopted legislation which require existing large emitters facilities releasing  tons or more of ghg emissions annually to reduce their annual emissions intensity by beginning july  the effect of this alberta legislation did not materially affect consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
should the federal and provincial governments in canada implement programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  spectra energy s businesses in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements canada may be obligated to reduce emissions  purchase emission credits and or pay a tax on carbon emissions 
due to the substantial uncertainty regarding what additional plans  if any  federal and provincial governments in canada will implement and whether these plans will apply to spectra energy s facilities  spectra energy cannot estimate the potential effects of greenhouse gas regulation in canada on business  earnings  financial condition and cash flows 
spectra energy is involved in numerous legal proceedings  the outcome of which are uncertain  and resolution adverse to spectra energy could negatively affect results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
spectra energy is subject to numerous legal proceedings 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and spectra energy cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance 
it is reasonably possible that the final resolution of some of the matters in which spectra energy is involved could require additional expenditures  in excess of established reserves  over an extended period of time and in a range of amounts that could have a material effect on cash flows and results of operations 
spectra energy relies on access to short term money markets and longer term capital markets to finance capital requirements and support liquidity needs  and access to those markets can be adversely affected  particularly if spectra energy or its rated subsidiaries are unable to maintain an investment grade credit rating  which could adversely affect cash flows or restrict business 
spectra energy s business is financed to a large degree through debt 
the maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from assets 
accordingly  spectra energy relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt 
spectra energy s senior unsecured long term debt is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies 
if the rating agencies were to rate spectra energy or its rated subsidiaries below investment grade  such entity s borrowing costs would increase  perhaps significantly 
in addition  the entity would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings  and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease 
spectra energy maintains revolving credit facilities to provide for borrowings  back up for commercial paper programs and or letters of credit at various entities 
these facilities typically include financial covenants which limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity 
failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude that entity from issuing commercial paper or letters of credit or borrowing under the revolving credit facility and could require other affiliates to immediately pay down any outstanding drawn amounts under other revolving credit agreements which could adversely affect cash flow or restrict businesses 
furthermore  if spectra energy s short term debt rating were to be below tier eg a p  s p and moody s  respectively  access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited 
if spectra energy is not able to access capital at competitive rates  its ability to finance operations and implement its strategy may be adversely affected 
restrictions on spectra energy s ability to access financial markets may also affect its ability to execute its business plan as scheduled 
an inability to access capital may limit spectra energy s ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on for future growth 
any downgrade or other event negatively affecting the credit ratings of spectra energy s subsidiaries could make their costs of borrowing higher or access to funding sources more limited  which in turn could increase spectra energy s need to provide liquidity in the form of capital contributions or loans to such subsidiaries  thus reducing the liquidity and borrowing availability of the consolidated group 

table of contents 
index to financial statements spectra energy may be unable to secure long term transportation agreements  which could expose transportation volumes and revenues to increased volatility 
in the future  spectra energy may be unable to secure long term transportation agreements for its gas transmission business as a result of economic factors  lack of commercial gas supply to its systems  increased competition  or changes in regulation 
without long term transportation agreements  spectra energy s revenues and contract volumes will be exposed to increased volatility 
the inability to secure these agreements would materially adversely affect business  earnings  financial condition or cash flows 
market based natural gas storage operations are subject to commodity price volatility which could result in variability in earnings and cash flows 
spectra energy has market based rates for some of its storage operations and sells its storage services based on natural gas market spreads and volatility 
if natural gas market spreads or volatility deviate from historical norms or there is significant growth in the amount of storage capacity available to natural gas markets  spectra energy s approach to managing its market based storage contract portfolio may not protect it from significant variations in storage revenues 
native land claims have been asserted in british columbia and alberta which could affect future access to public lands  the success of which claims could have a significant adverse affect on spectra energy s natural gas production and processing 
certain aboriginal groups have claimed aboriginal and treaty rights over a substantial portion of public lands on which spectra energy s facilities in british columbia and alberta  and the gas supply areas served by those facilities  are located 
the existence of these claims  which range from the assertion of rights of limited use to aboriginal title  has given rise to some uncertainty regarding access to public lands for future development purposes 
such claims  if successful  could have a significant adverse effect on natural gas production in british columbia and alberta which could have a material adverse effect on the volume of natural gas processed at spectra energy s facilities and of ngls and other products transported in the associated pipelines 
spectra energy cannot predict the outcome of these claims or the effect they may ultimately have on business and operations 
protecting against potential terrorist activities requires significant capital expenditures and a successful terrorist attack could adversely affect spectra energy s business 
acts of terrorism and any possible reprisals as a consequence of any action by the united states and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the united states 
this risk is particularly great for companies  like spectra energy  operating in any energy infrastructure industry that handles volatile gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons 
the potential for terrorism has subjected spectra energy s operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on business 
in particular  spectra energy may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its facilities and pipelines  such as additional physical facility and pipeline security and additional security personnel 
moreover  any physical damage to high profile facilities resulting from acts of terrorism may not be covered  or covered fully  by insurance 
spectra energy may be required to expend material amounts of capital to repair any facilities  the expenditure of which could adversely affect cash flow and business 
due to changes in canadian tax laws  spectra energy may not be able to fully realize its goal of utilizing tax efficient structures to improve its cost of capital  optimize returns on assets and finance portfolio growth 
spectra energy s business strategy includes utilizing tax efficient structures  such as master limited partnerships mlps and canadian income trusts 
while the tax treatment for mlps has not changed  on 
table of contents 
index to financial statements october   the minister of finance of canada announced changes to the income tax treatment of flow through entities in canada  including income trusts 
legislation has now been enacted whereby income trusts will be subject to tax at corporate rates on the taxable portion of their distributions 
further  unitholders will be treated as if they have received a dividend equal to the taxable portion of their distributions  and will be taxed accordingly 
these proposed changes will generally apply beginning in the taxation year for trusts that begin to be publicly traded after october  but would only apply beginning with the taxation year to those income trusts  such as the income fund  that were already publicly traded at the time of the announcement 
such changes could have an adverse effect on spectra energy s ability to fully implement its business strategy which may affect its access to capital and the ability to maximize returns on the assets it might hold  and result in an inability to finance portfolio growth through the use of this vehicle 
spectra energy might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances as a result of its separation from duke energy 
to preserve the tax free treatment to duke energy of the distribution of spectra energy to the shareholders of duke energy  under the tax matters agreement that spectra energy entered into with duke energy  for the two year period following the distribution  spectra energy may be prohibited  except in specified circumstances  from issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs  acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities  or engaging in other actions or transactions that could jeopardize the tax free status of the distribution 
these restrictions may limit spectra energy s ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of its business 
poor investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors affecting pension plan costs could unfavorably affect spectra energy s earnings and liquidity 
spectra energy s costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors  such as the rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans  future government regulation and spectra energy s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans 
without sustained growth in the pension plan investments over time to increase the value of spectra energy s plan assets  and depending upon the other factors impacting spectra energy s costs as listed above  spectra energy could be required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash 
such cash funding obligations could have a material effect on spectra energy s earnings and cash flows
