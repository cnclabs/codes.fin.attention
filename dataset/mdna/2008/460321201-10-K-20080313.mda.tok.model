our forward looking statements are based upon our judgment and assumptions as of the date such statements are made concerning future developments and events  many of which are outside of our control 
these forward looking statements  and the assumptions upon which such statements are based  are inherently speculative and are subject to uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements 
important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations may include  without limitation  our ability to i identify customers with marine transportation needs requiring specialized vessels or operating techniques  ii secure financing on satisfactory terms to acquire  modify  or construct vessels if such financing is necessary to service the potential needs of current or future customers  iii obtain new contracts or renew existing contracts which would employ certain of our vessels or other assets upon the expiration of contracts currently in place  on favorable economic terms  iv manage the amount and rate of growth of our general and administrative expenses and costs associated with operating certain of our vessels  v and manage our growth in terms of implementing internal controls and information systems and hiring or retaining key personnel  among other things 
other factors include vi changes in cargo  charterhire  fuel  and vessel utilization rates  vii the rate at which competitors add or scrap vessels in the markets as well as demolition scrap prices and the availability of scrap facilities in which we operate  viii changes in interest rates which could increase or decrease the amount of interest we incur on borrowings with variable rates of interest  and the availability and cost of capital to us  ix the impact on our financial statements of nonrecurring accounting charges that may result from our ongoing evaluation of business strategies  asset valuations  and organizational structures  x changes in accounting policies and practices adopted voluntarily or as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  xi changes in laws and regulations such as those related to government assistance programs and tax rates  xii the frequency and severity of claims against us  and unanticipated outcomes of current or possible future legal proceedings  xiii unplanned maintenance and out of service days on our vessels  xiv the ability of customers to fulfill obligations with us  xv the performance of unconsolidated subsidiaries  xvi our ability to effectively handle our substantial leverage by servicing and meeting the covenant requirements in each of our debt instruments  thereby avoiding any defaults under those instruments and avoiding cross defaults under others  and xvii other economic  competitive  governmental  and technological factors which may affect our operations

table of contents critical accounting policies set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  financial condition  and results of operations and which require complex management judgments or estimates and entail material uncertainties 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
voyage revenue and expense recognition revenues and expenses relating to our rail ferryservice segments voyages are recorded over the duration of the voyage 
our voyage expenses are estimated at the beginning of the voyages based on historical actual costs or from industry sources familiar with those types of charges 
as the voyage progresses  these estimated costs are revised with actual charges and timely adjustments are made 
the expenses are ratably expensed over the voyage based on the number of days in progress at the end of the period 
we believe there is no material difference between recording estimated expenses ratably over the voyage versus recording expenses as incurred 
revenues and expenses relating to our other segments voyages  which require no estimates or assumptions  are recorded when earned or incurred during the reporting period 
depreciation provisions for depreciation are computed on the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets 
various methods are used to estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our depreciable assets and due to the capital intensive nature of our business and our large base of depreciable assets  changes in such estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations 
drydocking costs we defer certain costs related to the drydocking of our vessels 
deferred drydocking costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period between drydockings generally two to five years 
because drydocking charges can be material in any one period  we believe that the acceptable deferred method provides a better matching for the amortization of those costs over future revenue periods benefiting from the drydocking of our vessel 
we capitalize only those costs that are incurred to meet regulatory requirements or upgrades  or that add economic life to the vessel 
normal repairs  whether incurred as part of the drydocking or not  are expensed as incurred 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
provisions for income taxes include deferred income taxes that are provided on items of income and expense  which affect taxable income in one period and financial income in another 
certain foreign operations are not subject to income taxation under pertinent provisions of the laws of the country of incorporation or operation 
however  pursuant to existing us tax laws  earnings from certain of our foreign operations are subject to us income taxes when those earnings are repatriated to the us we have indefinitely re invested earnings of  of foreign earnings  and accordingly  have not provided deferred taxes in the amount of  against those earnings 
the jobs creation act  which first applied to us on january   changed the united states tax treatment of the foreign operations of our us flag vessels and our foreign flag shipping operations 
we made an election under the jobs creation act to have our qualifying us flag operations taxed under a new tonnage tax rather than under the usual us corporate income tax regime 
on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fin  to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we adopted fin on january  self retention insurance as explained further in note e to the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report  we maintain provisions for estimated losses under our self retention insurance based on estimates of the eventual claims settlement costs 
our policy is to establish self insurance provisions for hull and machinery and loss of hire for each policy year based on estimates from independent actuaries and management  and to generally maintain the provisions at those levels for the estimated run off period  approximately two years from the inception of that period 
we also establish provisions for p i insurance deductibles based on internal estimates 
we believe most claims will be reported  or estimates for existing claims will be revised  within this two year period 
subsequent to this two year period  self insurance provisions are adjusted to reflect our current estimate of loss exposure for the policy year 
our estimates are determined based on various factors  such as severity of the injury for personal injuries and estimated potential liability based on past judgments and settlements  advice from legal counsel based on its assessment of the facts of the case and its experience in other cases  probability of pre trial settlement which would mitigate legal costs  historical experience on claims for each specific type of cargo for cargo damage claims  and whether our seamen are employed in permanent positions or temporary revolving positions 
it is reasonably possible that changes in our estimated exposure may occur from time to time 
however  if during this two year period our estimate of loss exposure exceeds the actuarial estimate  then additional loss provisions are recorded to increase the self insurance provisions to our estimate of the eventual claims settlement cost 
the measurement of our exposure for self insurance liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of loss provisions recorded during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
asbestos claims we maintain provisions for estimated losses for asbestos claims based on estimates of eventual claims settlement costs 
our policy is to establish provisions based on a range of estimated exposure 
we estimate this potential range of exposure using input from legal counsel and internal estimates based on the individual deductible levels for each policy year 
we are also indemnified for certain of these claims by the previous owner of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the measurement of our exposure for asbestos liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of the loss provisions recorded during the period 
our estimates and assumptions are formed from variables such as the maximum deductible levels in a claim year  the amount of the indemnification recovery and the claimant s employment history with the company 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension and postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuary and information as to historical experience and performance 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 
in september of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
this statement requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans 
under sfas no 
 actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs or credits  and any remaining transition assets or obligations that have not been recognized under previous accounting standards must be recognized in other comprehensive income  net of tax effects  until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  the measurement date  the date at which plan assets and the benefit obligation are measured  is required to be the company s fiscal year end 
sfas no 
does not change the determination of net periodic benefit cost included in net income 
sfas no 
was effective for fiscal years ending after december  
table of contents results of operations executive summary our net income for the year ended december  was million  which included net income of million from our discontinued lash liner service 
net income for the full year was million  which included a gain of million  net of taxes  from the sale of our minority investment in another company  a pre tax impairment loss of million or million  net of taxes  on the write off of our former rail ferry service terminal in new orleans  and a loss of million  net of taxes  on our discontinued lash liner service 
during our operating income was million as compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  during  our operating income included the aforementioned impairment loss of million 
our operating results for were slightly improved over primarily due to our rail ferry service  which increased its capacity with the installation of second decks on both vessels in the second quarter of this improvement was partially offset by our time charter segment  which reported lower results in as compared to mainly due to higher operating cost associated with our us flag pure car truck carrier fleet 
depreciation expense increased in compared to as a result of the placement into service of the second decks on the rail ferry service vessels 
our administrative and general expenses increased in as compared to  reflecting a one time charge in associated with the termination of our lease on our new orleans office

excluding this loss  gross voyage profit increased from million in to the above mentioned million in revenues increased from million in to million in voyage expenses increased from million in to million in the changes of revenue and expenses associated with each of our segments are discussed within the gross voyage analysis below 
time charter contracts the decrease in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses 
these increases were primarily wages and maintenance  including drydock amortization charges on our us flag pure car truck carriers 
revenues for the segment increased from million in to million in this improvement is a result of higher volumes of supplemental cargoes in on our us flag pure car truck carriers  higher charter rates in on our foreign flag pure car truck carriers and increased charterhire days for our us flag jones act coal carrier  which was in drydock during the first and second quarters of contract of affreightment gross voyage profit of million for this segment in was consistent with while this segment operated more voyages in  higher port and fuel costs eroded some of these positive results as compared to rail ferry service gross voyage results before impairment loss for this segment improved from a loss of million in to a loss of million in this improvement is primarily from higher cargo volumes due to the installation of the second decks  which began operating in the third quarter of revenues for this segment increased from million in to million in due to the completion and operation of the second deck cargo volume in the added volume caused operating margins to improve  primarily in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the rail ferry service s gross voyage profit was million on revenue of million 
the pre tax impairment loss of million recorded in the second quarter of was related to our investment in the rail ferry service s terminal in new orleans located on the mississippi river gulf outlet mr go 
after hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast in  dredging of the mr go was indefinitely suspended by the army corps of engineers  effectively closing it to deep draft shipping 
other gross voyage profit for this segment increased from  in to million in primarily due to nonrecurring expenses in of million related to terminating the lease of an intermodal terminal facility in memphis  tennessee 
the decrease in revenue for this segment was mainly due to prior year income adjustments 
other income and expenses administrative and general expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily associated with one time costs related to the termination of our lease agreement on our former new orleans office and an increase in audit fees related to the initial audit of our internal control over financial reporting as required under section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the following table shows the significant a g components for the twelve months ending december  and respectively all amounts in thousands year ended december  a g account variance salaries and wages group insurance special services accounting audit fees relocation expenses other total interest expense decreased from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to the retirement of all the remaining outstanding obligations of our senior unsecured notes notes in october of the gain on sale of investments decreased  as the results reflect the sale of our investment in belden shipholding pte ltd bsh  a company that owned and operated cement carrier vessels 
this sale generated a gain of million in november of in  the gain on sale of investments of  was related to the sale of stock from the portfolio of investments  at the time held by our captive insurance company 
investment income increased from million in to million in primarily as a result of higher interest rates  and an increase in the overall average balance of funds invested during the full year in compared to loss on early extinguishment of debt of  reported in was due to the early retirement of million of our senior notes at a slight premium 

table of contents income taxes we recorded a benefit for federal income taxes of million on million of income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities in  reflecting tax losses on operations taxed at the us corporate statutory rate 
for  our provision was million on our million income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities 
our tax benefit increased from the comparable prior year primarily as a result of incurring taxes on the gain on sale of bsh in november of in  we were able to release million of our valuation allowance as a result of the generation of certain foreign earnings 
we have indefinitely re invested  of foreign earnings  and accordingly  have not provided deferred taxes of  against those earnings 
our qualifying us flag operations continue to be taxed under a tonnage tax regime rather than under the normal us corporate income tax regime 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  net of taxes  increased from million in to million in the improved results came from our investment in dry bulk cape holding ltd dry bulk  a company owning two capesize bulk carriers and two panamax bulk carriers  which contributed million in compared to million in  primarily due to a stronger charter market for dry bulk vessels 
during the second quarter of  dry bulk entered into a ship purchase agreement with mitsui co 
of japan for two newbuildings handymax bulk carriers to be delivered in the first half of total investment in the newbuildings is anticipated to be approximately million  of which the company s share would be or approximately million 
we expect to make our interim construction payments with cash generated from operations 
a decision on any long term financing will be determined at delivery 
our share of the initial contract payment of  was made in may of discontinued operations in the third quarter of  we elected to discontinue our international lash service by the end of during the first two months of  we sold the one remaining lash vessel and the majority of lash barges  with the remaining lash barges under contract to be sold by the end of the first quarter of the gain of million recorded in reflects a gain of million on the sale of two lash vessels and million on the sale of lash barges 
during  total revenues associated with the discontinued lash services were million  compared to million for losses from operations before taxes were million in  compared to million in our us flag lash service and international lash service were reported in continuing operations as a part of our liner segment in periods prior to june  the financial results for all periods presented have been restated to remove the effects of both of those operations from continuing operations

excluding this loss  gross voyage profit increased from million in to million in revenues increased from million in to million in voyage expenses increased from million in to million in the changes of revenue and expenses associated with each of our segments are discussed within the gross voyage analysis below 
time charter contracts the increase in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in was primarily due to the addition of our fifth us flag pctc in september of compared to a full year in the increase in gross voyage profit was partially offset by our coal carrier being out of service for days in for capital improvements and for a periodic special survey as required for classification standards 
the capital improvements were necessary to replace some of the vessel s steel as part of the special survey 
additionally  the special survey  including drydocking  was originally scheduled for  but was instead performed concurrently with the capital improvements for economic efficiency 
the vessel returned to service in june of and continued its firm time charter employment through the end of the year 
although the vessel substantially fulfilled its obligation under the time charter contract  it was not available for further utilization by the charter or for commercial sub off hire  as it was during  due to the time out of service 
revenues increased for this segment from million in to million in due to revenue contributions for full months in from the fifth us flag pctc  acquired in september of and the start of an additional foreign flag pctc in expenses increased for this segment from million in to million in this increase was mainly due to higher operating costs  consisting primarily of wages and maintenance and additional operating days 
contract of affreightment gross voyage profit for this segment decreased from million in to million in this segment  which consists of a contract associated with our molten sulphur carrier  was impacted by less available tonnage above the contract minimum in as compared to the  decrease of revenues for this segment was due to the vessel being in drydock in the first quarter and part of the second quarter of rail ferry service gross voyage results before impairment loss for this segment improved slightly from a loss of million in to a loss of million in improved operations resulting from higher cargo volumes were mostly offset by higher depreciation related to capital improvements to the terminal in new orleans  which began operating in the second half of  and to the vessels used in the service in late and early the increase in the depreciation of the terminal in new orleans only affected the first half of because the net investment in that terminal was written down to zero at the end of the second quarter of when we determined that it was impaired 
revenues for this segment increased from million in to million in due to both vessels being out of service for repairs and steelwork and while awaiting repairs to the terminal after hurricane katrina in expenses for this segment increased from million in to million in this increase was a result of a large increase of operating days in compared to the reduced operating days in  which was adversely impacted by hurricane katrina 
the impairment loss of million recorded in the second quarter of was related to our investment in the rail ferry service s terminal in new orleans located on the mr go 
after hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast in  dredging of the mr go was indefinitely suspended by the army corps of engineers  effectively closing it to long term deep draft shipping 
this resulted in our decision to relocate our rail ferry service s us terminal operations from new orleans to mobile  alabama 
after reviewing the options available to us for utilization of the assets that will remain at the new orleans terminal following the relocation  we determined that our net investment of million in those assets was impaired 
the cost and funding of the new terminal in mobile are discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section 
other gross voyage profit for this segment decreased from  in to  in primarily due to nonrecurring expenses in of million related to terminating the lease of an intermodal terminal facility in memphis  tennessee 
the facility was previously used in our liner services segment 
we have been monitoring the cargo being processed through that facility and evaluating other uses for the facility  and late in  we decided to terminate the lease 
revenues decreased  in compared to  where as operating expenses remained constant 
other income and expenses administrative and general expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily associated with one time costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters  higher fees for professional services  and employee bonus expenses

higher interest rates on our variable rate loans also contributed to the increase during the year 
of our million of long term debt outstanding as of december   million is subject to variable interest rates 
reductions in interest expense resulting from the repurchase of million of our senior notes in and regularly scheduled payments on outstanding debt partially offset the increase 
the gain on sale of investments in of million was primarily related to the sale of our investment in belden shipholding pte ltd bsh  a company that owns and operates cement carrier vessels 
in november of  we sold our investment in bsh for a gain of million 
in  the gain on sale of investments of  was related to the sale of stock from the portfolio of investments held by our captive insurance company

discontinued operations in  we sold the assets associated with our over the road car transportation truck company 
we sold these assets primarily due to a decrease during in the volume of business available to us due to the loss of market share by one of our customers and an industry wide shortage of drivers that caused underutilization of the assets 
the sale of these assets resulted in a net loss before taxes of  losses from operations before taxes were million in the over the road car transportation truck company was reported in the other segment in previous periods

in  lash barges were sold that were no longer needed for operations 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere herein as part of our consolidated financial statements 
our working capital which we define as the difference between our total current assets and total current liabilities increased from million at december   to million at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased during by million to a total of million 
this decrease was primarily due to the retirement of all the remaining outstanding obligations of our senior unsecured notes notes in october of of million  cash used by other financing activities of million  and cash used for investing activities of million  partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of million 
of the million in current liabilities at december   million related to current maturities of long term debt 
operating activities generated positive cash flow after adjusting net income of million for non cash provisions such as depreciation  amortization and gains on sales of assets and investments 
cash provided by operating activities of million for also included a decrease in accounts receivable of million primarily due to the timing of collections of receivables from the msc and us department of transportation  offset by an decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
also included was million of cash used to cover payments for vessel drydocking costs in  offset by cash distributions of million received from our investments in unconsolidated entities 
cash used by investing activities of million for included proceeds from the sales of assets of million  including million on the sale of the molten sulphur carrier discussed below and million on the sale of lash assets and our investment in our unconsolidated entity in mexico ttg 
these were offset by the use of million of cash for the purchase of capital assets  including million for a us flag pctc  which was previously under lease  million for the first payment on the ceu newbuilding pctc discussed below  and million for second deck modifications on the rail ferry vessels 
cash used for financing activities of million for included regularly scheduled debt payments of million  and million for the retirement of our senior notes  as well as million for preferred stock dividend payments

the above contractual obligations table does not include an approximate million obligation to the alabama state port authority related to the terminal upgrades in mobile  al  to be paid by us over the ten year terminal lease 
at this time  we do not have a payment plan in place for this obligation 
restructuring of liner services and disposition of certain lash assets the board of directors decided in the fourth quarter of to dispose of certain lash liner service assets 
the decision was based on the belief that we could generate substantial cash flow and profit on the disposition of the assets  while improving our future operating results 
accordingly  we sold our lash feeder vessel and barges in the first quarter of in the second quarter of we sold our one remaining us flag lash vessel and lash barges 
in the third quarter of  the company elected to discontinue its international lash service by the end of during the first two months of  we sold the one remaining lash vessel and the majority of lash barges  with the remaining lash barges under contract to be sold by the end of the first quarter of the gain of million recorded in reflects a gain of million on the sale of the lash feeder vessel and liner vessel  and million on the sale of lash barges 
during  total revenues associated with the discontinued lash services were million  compared to million for losses from operations before taxes were million in  compared to million in our us flag lash service and international lash service was reported in continuing operations as a part of our liner segment in periods prior to june  financial information for all periods presented have been restated to remove the effects of those operations from continuing operations 
rail ferry service expansion this service provides a unique combination of rail and water ferry service between the us gulf and mexico 
the low operating profit margin generated by this service makes higher cargo volumes necessary to achieve meaningful levels of cash flow and profitability 
the capacity of the vessels operating in our rail ferry service defines the maximum revenues and  in turn  the cash flow and gross profits that can be generated by the service 
accordingly we have made investments that essentially double the capacity of the service including the construction of second decks on each of the ships as well as construction of new terminals in mobile  al and an upgraded terminal in coatzacoalcos  mexico 
we expect this expansion to reduce our cost per unit of cargo carried and increase our cash flow if we are able to book cargo for substantially all of the additional capacity 
while we can give no assurance at this time that we will be successful in doing so  we believe that the market will sustain these vessels for the foreseeable future 
we believe that the rail ferry service s strong trade support warranted the program expansion 
the total cost of adding the second decks is approximately million  which we paid in full through december  the installation of the second deck on the first vessel was completed at the end of may  while installation of the second deck on the second vessel was completed at the end of july the utilization of the second deck capacity is directly related to the terminal upgrades in mobile  al and coatzacoalcos  mexico 
both terminal upgrades were substantially completed in july and became operational at that time 
the estimated cost of the mobile terminal is approximately million  of which million was funded by a grant from the state of alabama 
the remaining million is being financed with a loan from the alabama state port authority and repaid by us over the ten year terminal lease 
we estimate that our share of the cost of the improvements to the terminal in mexico will be approximately million 
we have a interest in the company that owns the terminal in mexico  and of the advances to that company for our share of the cost of the terminal are accounted for as capital contributions with the remaining accounted for as a loan to that company 
as of december   the cost of our total investment in a joint venture that owns a trans loading and storage facility rti  which was used to support the rail ferry service in new orleans included an equity investment in unconsolidated entities of million and an outstanding loan of approximately million due from our partner in the venture 
as a result of our terminal operations moving from new orleans to mobile  an impairment test to determine our loss exposure on this facility was required 
as of december  no impairment was recorded as we expect to recover our total investment 
our terminal lease with the port of new orleans was terminated during the second quarter of  when we transitioned to the mobile terminal 
as of june   we wrote off both the cost of the new orleans terminal of million  funded by the state and city  which was recorded as a leasehold improvement  and the reimbursements to us from the state and the city of million that were recorded as deferred credits  resulting in no effect on net income 
our investment in the new orleans terminal was funded with the proceeds from a new market tax credit nmtc financing agreement 
under the nmtc financing  the lender has the ability to utilize certain tax credits associated with profitable operations at that location 
with the relocation of the operations to mobile  alabama  the lender has amended the original application to the federal agency that oversees the nmtc issuance to include the mobile terminal as eligible property for the usage of the tax credits 
relocation of corporate headquarters in addition to the incentives for relocating our rail ferry service s terminal  the state of alabama and the city and county of mobile have provided us with incentives totaling million to relocate our corporate headquarters from new orleans to mobile 
as of december  we have received million in incentive payments from the alabama agencies 
in may of  we reached an agreement to terminate the lease of our former corporate headquarters in new orleans 
the cost of this termination was approximately  which was reported in administrative and general expenses in the second quarter of bulk carriers we have a interest in dry bulk  which owns two capesize bulk carriers and two panamax bulk carriers 
this investment is accounted for under the equity method and our share of earnings or losses are reported in our consolidated statements of income net of taxes 
dry bulk has entered into a ship purchase agreement with mitsui co 
of japan for newbuilding two handymax bulk carriers  scheduled to be delivered in total investment in the newbuildings is anticipated to be approximately million  of which our share would be or approximately million 
during the period of construction up to delivery  where of the projected overall costs will be expended  dry bulk plans to finance these costs with equity contributions of up to with the balance of the cost being financed 
upon completion and delivery  dry bulk plans to establish permanent long term financing

pless of an alleged discharge of untreated bilge water by one or more members of the crew 
the uscg has inspected the ship and interviewed various crew members

the uscg has recently informed counsel for the company that while the investigation of a certain single individual is continuing  at this time the company is not a target of the investigation 
if  however  the company is subject to an administrative or civil penalty from the coast guard  we believe that such a fine would not be material

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and commodity price risk 
we utilize derivative financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward exchange contracts  and in the past we have also utilized commodity swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
we hedge only firm commitments or anticipated transactions and do not use derivatives for speculation 
we neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at december   approximated its carrying value due to its short term duration 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates at year end for our investment portfolio is not material 
the fair value of long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million compared to a carrying value of million 
the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the borrowing rates applicable to our long term debt at december  is not applicable due to the retirement of all of the company s remaining outstanding obligations of its senior unsecured notes in october of we have entered into five interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks  two in september of  one in november of  one in september of  and one in november of in order to reduce the possible impact of higher interest rates in the long term market by utilizing the fixed rate available with the swap 
for each of these agreements  the fixed rate payor is the company  and the floating rate payor is the commercial bank 
while these arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates  it also limits the benefit we might otherwise receive from any decreases in interest rates 
the fair value of these agreements at december   estimated based on the amount that the banks would receive or pay to terminate the swap agreements at the reporting date  taking into account current market conditions and interest rates  is a liability of million 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december  would have resulted in a million liability 
commodity price risk as of december   we do not have commodity swap agreements in place to manage our exposure to price risk related to the purchase of the estimated fuel requirements for our rail ferry service segment 
we have fuel surcharges in place for our rail ferry service  which we expect to effectively manage the price risk for those services during revenues from fuel surcharges in for the rail ferry service was million 
if we had commodity swap agreements  they could be structured to reduce our exposure to increases in fuel prices 
however  they would also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from any price decreases associated with this commodity 
a increase in the price of fuel for the period january  through december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in our fuel costs for the same period  and in a corresponding decrease of approximately in our basic earnings per share based on the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  however  we believe that some or all of the price increase could have been passed on to our customers through the aforementioned fuel surcharges during the same period but might have been limited by our need to maintain competitive rates 
our charterers in the time charter segment are responsible for purchasing vessel fuel requirements  thus  we have no fuel price risk in this segment 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm purchase commitments with varying maturities throughout the fair value of these contracts at december   is a liability of  the potential fair value of these contracts that would have resulted from a hypothetical adverse change in the exchange rates would be immaterial
