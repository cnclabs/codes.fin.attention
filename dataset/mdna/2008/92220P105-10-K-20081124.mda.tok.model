fiscal years dollars in millions thereafter total assets cash and cash equivalents average interest rate liabilities long term debt average interest rate the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents of which was held abroad at september  and could be subject to additional taxation if it was repatriated to the united states approximated the principal amounts reflected above based on the maturities of these financial instruments 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on the current rates available to us for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities 
under this method  the fair value of our debt was estimated to be million at september  we determined the estimated fair value amount by using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies 
however  it requires considerable judgment in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the fair value estimate presented is not necessarily indicative of the amount that we or holders of the instrument could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value 
although payments under certain of our operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  these operating leases do not expose us to material interest rate risk
