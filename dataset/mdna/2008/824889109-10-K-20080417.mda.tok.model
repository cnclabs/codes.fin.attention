item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in part ii  item of this report 
overview of our business shoe carnival  inc is one of the nation s largest family footwear retailers 
as of february   we operated stores in states primarily in the midwest  south and southeast regions of the united states 
we offer a distinctive shopping experience  a broad merchandise assortment and value to our customers while maintaining an efficient store level cost structure 
our stores combine competitive pricing with a highly promotional  in store marketing effort that encourages customer participation and creates a fun and exciting shopping experience 
we believe this highly promotional atmosphere results in various competitive advantages  including increased multiple unit sales  the building of a loyal  repeat customer base  the creation of word of mouth advertising  and enhanced sell through of in season goods 
our objective is to be the destination store of choice for a wide range of consumers seeking moderately priced  current season name brand and private label footwear 
our product assortment includes dress and casual shoes  sandals  boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoes for the entire family 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of both athletic and non athletic footwear  we are able to reduce our exposure to shifts in fashion preferences between those categories 
our marketing effort targets moderate income  value conscious consumers seeking name brand footwear for all age groups 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of popular styles of name brand merchandise at competitive prices  we generate broad customer appeal 
our cost efficient store operations and real estate strategy enable us to price products competitively 
low labor costs are achieved by housing merchandise directly on the selling floor in an open stock format  enabling customers to serve themselves  if they choose 
this reduces the staffing required to assist customers and reduces store level labor costs as a percentage of sales 
we locate stores predominantly in strip shopping centers in order to take advantage of lower occupancy costs and maximize our exposure to value oriented shoppers 
in fiscal  our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program  which will terminate upon the earlier of the repurchase of the maximum amount or december  share repurchases under this authorization may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price  corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions 
as of february   approximately million shares had been repurchased at an aggregate cost of million 
the amount that remained available under the existing repurchase authorization at february  was million 
our fiscal year is a week year ending on the saturday closest to january unless otherwise stated  references to years     and  relate respectively to the fiscal years ended february   february   january   january   and january  fiscal year consisted of weeks and the other fiscal years consisted of weeks 
the rd week in fiscal caused a one week shift forward in the start of fiscal causing our year over year sales comparisons to be impacted 
our reported year to date comparable store sales results for fiscal  both in this annual report on form k and in our other public reports and disclosures  have been adjusted for the above shift 
as such  changes in comparable store sales may not be consistent with changes in net sales reported for the fiscal period 
net sales for our week fiscal year ended february  compares to our week fiscal year ended february  to minimize the effect of the fiscal calendar shift on comparable store sales  we compare our week fiscal year ended february  to the week period ended february executive summary fiscal proved to be a difficult period for us and footwear retailers in general 
the challenging economic environment continued to directly affect our targeted moderate income consumer  and consequently  had a negative impact on both our traffic and sales throughout the year 
in addition to declining economic conditions  there were a number of other significant factors which directly impacted our operating results for fiscal  especially in comparison to fiscal lack of a compelling fashion trend after coming off two strong fashion driven years in the men s and women s dress categories of footwear  our core customers did not respond to the style and color direction this past year 
additionally  the athletic industry has been unable to identify a dominant fashion trend in recent years and as a result  sales of athletic footwear retailers have declined 
conversion to a new distribution center and relocation to a new corporate headquarters it was anticipated that we would experience a deleveraging of costs associated with our new facilities 
in addition to the one time conversion costs incurred during the relocation of the distribution center  the increase in fixed facility operating costs precluded us from leveraging these expenses in the near term 
versus week fiscal year fiscal represented a week period as compared to the week period in fiscal we earned approximately per diluted share in the extra week of fiscal despite the challenges we faced in fiscal there were a number of positive achievements maintained tight control over inventory levels our merchants did a good job of controlling inventories  both in terms of quantity and composition 
at the end of each quarter  our inventories were at or below the prior year on a per store average and we concluded fiscal down approximately percent from the end of the prior fiscal year 
continued new store growth in fiscal we opened new stores 
consistent with our real estate strategy  these new stores are located in large and small markets in both new and existing geographic areas 
we continued to fill in under penetrated markets with additional stores in order to improve the performance of the overall market 
we also continued to enter smaller markets that we can fully penetrate with one or two stores 
initiated a share repurchase program during fiscal  approximately million shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of million 
despite this significant outlay of cash  we ended the fiscal year with no outstanding long term debt 
converted to a new distribution center with minimal product delivery disruption while many in the retail sector have experienced overwhelming challenges and product delivery interruptions during conversion to new distribution centers  we experienced minimal disruption of product flow to our stores 
relocated to a new corporate headquarters without a lost work day we were able to relocate our corporate headquarters over a three day holiday weekend and return to normal operations by the following tuesday 
our stores experienced no disruption in computer services or support from our corporate staff 
while we anticipate that the retail business environment in which we operate will be challenging in fiscal  we believe our strong brand name in existing markets and a cost efficient operating model provide us with opportunities for growth and increased profitability 
our primary focus in fiscal will be on enhancing store performance metrics and continuing our efforts to provide long term earnings growth to our shareholders 
to accomplish this in today s competitive retail environment  we recognize that we must always deliver the latest fashion  stay in stock with sizes  offer competitive pricing and provide a start to finish memorable shopping experience 
if our management group executes these initiatives in fiscal  we can continue building a loyal  repeat customer base 
we have undertaken the following initiatives to deliver these expectations reducing assortments  creating more size depth in key styles and delivering the right shoes to the right stores we believe that the compelling fashion of our core products will be on target for what the consumer is seeking 
we also believe a higher conversion rate will result by increasing the depth of size runs in these key fashion offerings 
in order to increase size runs  we are strategically reducing our product assortment to keep store inventories at appropriate levels 
with these two initiatives comes the challenge of refining store assortments to deliver the right product and quantities 
achieving incremental gains in average retail price points while maintaining competitive pricing like most retailers  we are facing increases in the cost of product sourced from china 
we have chosen to take this opportunity to add additional features to certain private label product in order to create greater intrinsic value to our customer 
we are also working to create the same elevation in intrinsic value to the customer for branded product by improving key fashion and comfort elements 
although our intent is to pass these costs onto the customer through higher average retail prices  our ability to achieve this goal is largely dependent upon the promotional nature of the retail footwear industry over the course of the next year 
achieving growth in women s non athletic product we believe that the improvement in key fashion and comfort elements of our women s dress and casual merchandise will help us achieve our goal of increasing these categories to to percent of our total sales over the next two years 
historically  women s non athletic product has achieved the highest gross profit margin of any of our footwear categories 
refocusing our marketing strategy towards our target consumer another important initiative for fiscal is to continue to gain an understanding of the value based needs of our target consumer 
this starts with qualitative as well as quantitative analysis involving our core customers 
by better defining our customers expectations  we will be in a position to not only deliver the best footwear to satisfy their needs  but will also be able to more effectively market to our core consumers 
enhancing the customer s in store experience we are also challenging management throughout the chain to ensure we are delivering the total shopping experience the consumer is looking for 
we believe customer service is far more than just a helpful store associate 
it is satisfaction with every facet of the shoe carnival experience 
we are committed to providing an in store shopping experience that is not only fun and distinctive  but leaves the consumer knowing that we are providing fashionable high quality footwear for their lifestyle at a competitive price 
in fiscal  we expect to open between and stores 
these new stores will be located in large and small markets in both new and existing geographic areas 
our intention is to continue to fill in certain under penetrated larger markets with additional stores  thereby increasing the performance of the overall market 
we also intend to enter smaller markets that we can fully penetrate with one or two stores 
we generally can advertise more effectively in these markets  which helps to create immediate brand awareness 
we have adjusted  and will continue to adjust  our annual store growth rate based on our view of internal and external opportunities and challenges 
the number of new stores we open is dependent upon the availability of desirable store locations primarily in our existing larger markets and small markets in our current geographic footprint 
real estate developers are beginning to show signs of a slow down as the current macroeconomic environment is curtailing the expansion plans of many retailers  particularly those retailers that would serve as the anchor tenant in a desirable strip center 
while we recognize that the immediate profitability of newly opened stores will be impacted by this difficult macroeconomic environment  we also believe that taking advantage of real estate opportunities in a depressed retail market is a prudent long term strategy  especially when those store locations fill in existing under penetrated markets 
critical accounting policies it is necessary for us to include certain judgements in our reported financial results 
these judgements involve estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the accounting policies that require the more significant judgements are merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
in determining market value  we estimate the future sales price of items of merchandise contained in the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered in this determination include  among others  current and recently recorded sales prices  the length of time product has been held in inventory and quantities of various product styles contained in inventory 
the ultimate amount realized from the sale of certain product could differ materially from our estimates 
we also estimate a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that have been open longer than one year 
when events such as these occur  the assets subject to impairment are adjusted to estimated fair value and  if applicable  an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment  including current and future economic trends for stores  are subject to a high degree of judgement and if actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  additional losses may be recorded 
income taxes we calculate income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
and account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the estimated tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
under fin  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgements regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations are often complex  ambiguous and change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgements can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
see our notes to consolidated financial statements  note income taxes included in part ii  item of this report for further details 
insurance reserves we use a combination of self insurance and third party insurance for workers compensation  employee medical and general liability insurance 
these plans have stop loss provisions that protect us from individual and aggregate losses over specified dollar values 
when estimating our self insured liabilities  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  statistical trends and  in certain instances  valuation assistance provided by independent third parties 
we will continue to evaluate our self insured liabilities and the underlying assumptions on a quarterly basis and make adjustments as needed 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accruals 
while we believe that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimating process 
in the event we determine an accrual should be increased or reduced  we will record such adjustments in the period in which such determination is made 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the following fiscal years net sales cost of sales including buying  distribution  and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income in the regular course of business  we offer our customers sales incentives including coupons  discounts  and free merchandise 
sales are recorded net of such incentives and returns and allowances 
if an incentive involves free merchandise  that merchandise is recorded as a zero sale and the cost is included in cost of sales 
comparable store sales for the periods indicated below include stores that have been open for full months prior to the beginning of the period  including those stores that have been relocated or remodeled 
therefore  stores opened or closed during the periods indicated are not included in comparable store sales 
compared to net sales net sales decreased million to million in fiscal  a decrease from net sales of million in fiscal comparable store sales for the week period ended february  decreased  or approximately million  compared to the week period ended february  this decrease in net sales was partially offset by a million increase in sales generated by the stores opened in fiscal and the effect of a full year s worth of sales for the stores opened in fiscal  net of the sales loss from the stores which were closed during the same periods 
additional sales of approximately million were recorded in the rd week of fiscal we believe the constriction of the general economy during fiscal directly affected our target customer through higher gasoline prices  escalating food costs  housing and mortgage issues and increased consumer debt loads 
these conditions had a direct negative impact on traffic in our stores  and consequently  resulted in lower sales for fiscal the decline in comparable store sales was broad based  with all product categories experiencing a decline 
gross profit gross profit decreased million to million in fiscal  a decrease from gross profit of million in fiscal the gross profit margin for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal as a percentage of sales  the merchandise margin remained unchanged compared to the prior year  while buying  distribution and occupancy costs increased 
an increase in occupancy costs related primarily to the operation of net new stores coupled with declining sales accounted for of the increase 
the remaining was primarily related to increases in fixed distribution costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to during fiscal from in fiscal pre opening costs were million  or of sales  in fiscal as compared to  or of sales in fiscal we opened stores in fiscal as compared to stores in fiscal pre opening costs  such as advertising  payroll and supplies  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense in the period they are incurred 
our average pre opening costs per store were  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising expenditures 
the portion of store closing costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal was million  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to five fiscal store closings and the impairment and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close stores in fiscal  four in fiscal and one each in fiscal and in fiscal  we incurred  or as a percentage of sales  in store closing costs related to six fiscal store closings and an impairment charge for one store 
the timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly on a store by store basis depending  in part  on the period in which management commits to a closing plan  the remaining basis in the fixed assets at the store and any amounts required to be paid as part of the lease termination 
additional significant items associated with this net increase in selling  general and administrative expenses included million of additional expense to operate and support the net new stores stores opened since the beginning of fiscal  net of store closings  which was partially offset by million in comparable store expense savings primarily attributable to variable expense controls along with a million decrease in performance based incentive compensation expense 
the increase in costs associated with providing general and administrative services to the corporation account for the balance of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and are not materially significant as individual items 
interest income and expense interest income decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to lower average cash and cash equivalents balances available for investment purposes throughout fiscal interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal income taxes the effective income tax rate was for fiscal and in fiscal the effective income tax rate for both years differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state and local income taxes  net of the federal tax benefit and tax credits 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded  of state tax credits related to the investment in our new distribution center  which was the primary factor in reducing the company s effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal compared to net sales net sales increased million to million in fiscal  a increase over net sales of million in fiscal fiscal consisted of weeks compared to weeks in fiscal sales of approximately million were recorded in the extra week of fiscal comparable store sales for the week period ended january  increased  or approximately million 
the remaining increase was primarily related to sales generated by our new stores partially offset by the sales decrease resulting from store closings 
comparable store sales for the week period ended january  increased for non athletic merchandise and decreased for athletic product 
we attribute the sales decline in athletic product to the current fashion trends favoring dress and casual styles over that of traditional athletic 
we made significant progress in fiscal towards our goal of increasing women s casual and dress product as a percent of total sales 
historically  women s non athletic product has achieved the highest gross profit margin of any of our footwear categories 
for fiscal  our women s non athletic product rose to of total sales compared to in fiscal gross profit gross profit increased million to million in fiscal  a increase from gross profit of million in fiscal the gross profit margin for fiscal increased to from in fiscal as a percentage of sales  the merchandise margin increased while buying  distribution and occupancy costs increased 
the increase in merchandise margin  as a percentage of sales  was primarily driven by our continued improvements in inventory management and product assortment  which resulted in an increase in average selling price 
the increase in buying  distribution and occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales  was due primarily to incremental expenses of approximately  associated with the opening of a new distribution center during the fourth quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal  as a percentage of sales  decreased to from in fiscal significant changes in expenses included a  increase in stock based compensation and a  decrease in health care costs 
disclosure regarding our stock based compensation plans and the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  is contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report 
health care costs incurred during fiscal were unusually high and we believe we experienced a return to a more normal usage of benefits in fiscal additionally  at the beginning of our third quarter of fiscal  we entered into an agreement with a new provider to manage our self insured health benefits plan 
this resulted in year over year savings on claim management fees and preferred provider discounts 
the portion of store closing costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal was  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to six fiscal store closings and an impairment charge for one store 
in fiscal  we incurred million  or as a percentage of sales  in store closing costs related to seven fiscal store closings and impairment charges for three of the stores that closed in fiscal the year over year decrease was primarily attributable to the impairment charges we recorded in fiscal for the three stores we closed in fiscal the timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly on a store by store basis depending  in part  on the period in which management commits to a closing plan  the remaining basis in the fixed assets at the store and any amounts required to be paid as part of the lease termination 
pre opening expenses for the new stores in fiscal and the new stores in fiscal were approximately  and  respectively 
pre opening expenses represented of sales for both years 
pre opening costs  such as advertising  payroll and supplies  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense in the period they are incurred 
our average pre opening costs per store dropped by nearly in fiscal to  from  in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to changes in the mix of advertising media selected to advertise our openings and an increase in vendor cooperative advertising funds 
interest income and expense interest income increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was attributable to higher average cash and cash equivalents balances available for investment purposes throughout fiscal interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease was attributable to the effect of no direct borrowings being incurred during fiscal income taxes the effective income tax rate was for fiscal and in fiscal the effective income tax rate for both years differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state and local income taxes  net of the federal tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources our sources and uses of cash are summarized as follows s fiscal years net income plus depreciation and amortization   deferred income taxes   lease incentives changes in operating assets and liabilities   other operating activities    net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in provided by financing activities   net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents  our primary sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal these amounts reflect the income from operations adjusted for non cash items and working capital changes 
the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities between the two respective periods related primarily to the decrease in net income 
working capital decreased to million at february  from million at february   primarily from lower cash and cash equivalents as a result of purchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program 
this decrease in cash and cash equivalents was offset by an increase in merchandise inventories and other current assets and decreases in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities between years 
the current ratio at february  and february  was we had no outstanding long term debt at february  or february  capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal no capital lease obligations were incurred during this three year period 
of the fiscal capital expenditures  approximately million was used for new stores  million was used to equip the new distribution center  million was used for the purchase of furniture  accessories and computer equipment for our new corporate headquarters and million was used for store remodeling and relocations 
the remaining capital expenditures for fiscal were used for software and information technology  in store graphics and normal asset replacement activities 
lease incentives received from landlords were   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
capital expenditures are expected to be million to million in fiscal we intend to open to stores at an expected aggregate cost of between million and million in fiscal the remaining capital expenditures are expected to be incurred for store remodels and various other store improvements  along with continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities 
the actual amount of cash required for capital expenditures for store operations depends in part on the number of new stores opened  the amount of lease incentives  if any  received from landlords and the number of stores remodeled 
the opening of new stores will be dependent upon  among other things  the availability of desirable locations  and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending in areas we target for expansion 
our current store prototype uses between  and  square feet depending upon  among other factors  the location of the store and the population base the store is expected to service 
capital expenditures for a new store in fiscal are expected to average approximately  the average inventory investment in a new store is expected to range from  to  depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the timing of the new store opening 
pre opening expenses  such as advertising  salaries and supplies  are expected to average approximately  per store in fiscal on a per store basis  for the stores opened during fiscal  the initial inventory investment averaged  capital expenditures averaged  and lease incentives received from landlords averaged  on the three stores for which incentives were received 
significant contractual obligations as of february  and the fiscal years in which payments are due include s payments due by fiscal year and contractual obligations total after letters of credit   operating leases      purchase commitments   deferred compensation   fin liabilities   total contractual obligations     our unsecured credit facility provides for up to million in cash advances on a revolving basis and commercial letters of credit 
borrowings under the revolving credit line are based on eligible inventory 
the agreement governing the credit facility stipulates a minimum threshold for net worth  a maximum ratio of funded debt plus rent to ebitda plus rent  and a maximum of total distributions for stock repurchases and cash dividends 
we were in compliance with these requirements as of february  should a default condition be reported  the lenders may preclude additional borrowings and call all loans and accrued interest at their discretion 
the credit agreement and amendments thereto are filed as exhibits to or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and letters of credit outstanding were million at february  estimated interest payments on our line of credit are not included in the above table as our line of credit is subject to frequent borrowing and or repayment activities which does not lend itself to reliable forecasting for disclosure purposes 
as of february   million was available to us for additional borrowings under the credit facility 
on december   the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to april  and to allow us to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock in an amount not to exceed million 
in december  the board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program  which will terminate on the earlier of the repurchase of the maximum amount or december  as of february   approximately million shares had been repurchased at an aggregate cost of million 
the amount that remained available under the existing repurchase authorization at february  was million 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our revolving credit line  will be sufficient to fund our planned store expansion  any future repurchase of our common stock under our current repurchase plan and other operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
see note long term debt  note leases  note income taxes and note employee benefit plans to our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report for a further discussion of our contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not assign any store operating leases to separate third parties during fiscal we remain liable on three assignments of operating leases covering former store locations 
we believe that the likelihood of material liability being triggered under these leases is remote  and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations in our consolidated financial statements as of february  see note leases to our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report for further discussion 
except for the assignment of certain store operating leases and operating leases entered into in the normal course of business  we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal or fiscal  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at february  or february  seasonality our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores 
non capital expenditures  such as advertising and payroll  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense as incurred 
therefore  our results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which we incur pre opening expenses related to the opening of new stores 
we have three distinct peak selling periods easter  back to school and christmas
